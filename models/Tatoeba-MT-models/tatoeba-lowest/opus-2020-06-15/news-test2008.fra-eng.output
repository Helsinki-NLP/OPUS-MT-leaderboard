Inflation, in Europe, decreased food
The accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase of food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the euro area in 13 countries was more important than the previsions, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3,1 per cent was registered, indicated the Office of the European Community statistics located in Luxembourg.
Official previsions indicated only 3 percent, Blomberg reported.
In contrast to the American, British and Canadian Central Bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not declined the administrative interest rate, saying that the reduction of interests, with the growth of the primary material prices and the decrease of the unemployment rate, would lead to the generation of aspirative inflationist.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but approximately two percent.
According to an analysis, the Cache 22 for the ECB is: "inflation must be dissuadered" so that you should not have any further action on this subject.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3,3 per cent is a record in the last 12 years and in Spain, and it is returned from 3,6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has deployed because of the rapid increase in food and energy prices.
The cereals market rate has increased 88 per cent, and the soja course has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and milk products has also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the global petrol price increased by 52 percent and, last month, a black gold barrier costs almost 100 dollars.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will exceed 2.1, this year to 2.5 per cent but in 2009 will increase to 1.9.
According to analysis, the inflation rate for 12 months remains around 3 percent, however, the three-4 months next, the average annual rate is 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expected that the ECB reduces the management rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stamp, the number of participants of Fidesz (Aliance of youth Democrats) has increased significantly in the beginning of December. Since 2002, it has now been the largest number of participants, while Gallup (Speeding Institute) has never seen before so low socialist support, i.e. 13 per cent.
For the faithful elections, the difference would represent, due to the greatest definition of opposition elections, more than two thirds (71 per cent) against support of one fifth (20 percent) for the Hungarian Socialist.
According to the sondage, MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and SZDSZ (Aliance of Free Democrats) are under parliamentary season: their support is two percent in the whole population.
On the faithful elections some to go to vote, the number of two parties has increased from 1 per cent.
Economic climate has continued to deteriorate in comparison with the previous lower point, the proportion of those who have condemned that the country’s economic situation was particularly serious, it has never been so high, 41 percent and 46 percent additional the situation is very serious.
After the most optimistic perspectives of the spring and the past age, the families are again worse than their financial situation.
For the next year, most of the population provides aggravation and only one ten provides an improvement of the situation.
In December last, 71 per cent of those who were listed, a majority never seen in the previous trials of Gallup, has condemned that the first minister did his work rather bad than good.
13 percent of sounds have trusted or many trusts in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 per cent supports Viktor Orbán.
54 per cent does not trust the first minister and 27 per cent to the President of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change of political situation is the proportion of society that the compliance with regard to the first minister can be treated without government change.
While in the last October emergings, 35 percent of the sounds would like the Government and the first Minister to continue to work, this rate is only 20 percent. The relative majority (33 percent) believes that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question on the intention of vote, 60 per cent of the votes say that they would certainly vote and 20 percent additionals say that they may be voted.
In order to make the comparison, for "legal election to organize the next afternoon" only 55 percent of the sounds would be certainly involved and 15 percent additionals would be likely involved. Following the current intentions, the result of the referendum would not be any doubt.
74 per cent of people would not speak to the rights of higher education, 79 per cent would not say the costs of consultation and 84 per cent would not say to the hospital residence costs.
Only when we see the same proportions of those who expressed their intention to vote to the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters would reject the introduction of the rights of registration, consultations and residence costs in hospital.
Moreover, Tesco has increased its prices at about 20%
The hypermarks imposed in the Budator Trade Triangle have maintained the average increase of the prices of 16 per cent of the past year in the difference that the TVA rate has not increased this year.
Articles of Napi Gazdaság (Today Economic)
This year, in the Budators commercial triangle, the usual daily Christmas Panier also increased 16 per cent by average, a netly higher value of more than thousand forits in all hypermarks.
The prices, “the ones had already been embedded” in the large food stocks in December last, have no longer increased brutally compared to the higher basis.
However, consumers are obviously intended to see that the articles bought directly under nine thousand forgets last year now cost more than 10 thousand forts.
The daily Panier in the sounded hypermarks exceeded 91 forcents at least the psychological seal of ten thousand forents.
And the highest value of the panier was 10 573 square.
(In 2003, the value was 6,800 designs.)
The prices of the United Uncum and living fish are almost at the level of the past year, however the prices of the net, weight and the lake have increased strongly.
In the stores, the price of meat and bread followed the KSH data (Cental Statistics Institute) but, at the same time, was found from a kilometry to 139 fortress.
Competition has not declined the price of the product under 200 varcts.
He was surprised to see, also in this hypermark, that the price of the bottle contained by two litres of Coca-Cola was under 200 forints, so he costed only 257 bottles included.
It is prohibited that this year, in terms of daily Panier, evenan was the most sweetest and Cora.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of his daily Panier 15 percent while Tesco and evenan increased around 18 and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing the loyalest panier in the past year and the loneest pearl in this year, we find a difference of 12 percent while the difference between the lowest of the last year and the loyalest of this year is 21 percent.
The prices increased from 1 480 average projects.
In the past year, prices increased by 1,206 average, knowing that the impact of the increase in TVA rate was already noted in the Noël prices last year.
This process has made the trade overseer, hypermarks could not appear to be determined by what margins applying to products as soon as they were unable to prevent the impact of consumer price change.
(If a negotiator is badly calculated the rotation of a product, it is likely to lose a major benefit on the customed margin to trade intensity.)
Since the change of the TVA rate, the increase in the daily Panier's prices was so extremely excessive that the rodest carrier was more than 1 720 forers in the 2006 value, while the difference between the lowest painters was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive because the lowest carrier value was more than 1 630 forers than that of the last year, and the prices of the lower prices also increased from 1 284 forbits.
As we have found a catastrophic increase in the prices, at least 20 months, the daily consumption prices increased more than 30 per cent in the hypermarks.
(This does not confirm KSH's data in force: for certain foods of first need, the statistics institution has found an increase in prices exceeding 30% in 12 months.
This is the case for example of meat and egg.)
According to the daily Panier of this last, it appears almost absurd because the price level of this product, already pretty in the past year, has increased at least more than 10% compared to the base.
According to the indices, the makers are more stronger than the oil providers, as they have been able to accept the brutal increase of prices also by the multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarks do not fit, they continue to register good years.
According to our experiences, most of the customers no longer look at the prices in the three hypermarks visited.
They bought everything, they take long conservation foods by pallets.
Morning morning of the important tastes were formed to the cases of the three hypermarkees because the number of customers has increased brushly.
But, according to our information, the number of business is less important in province, many multinationals are able to not even reach the proposed number of business, not only for food but also for sustainable consumption articles.
Many hospitals make the economy on desinfectors
This year, more than thousand infections, mostly caused by the wrong use of antibiotics, were registered in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the number of beds, the overmending of medical personnel is not intended to block infections, stated the doctor as a head of the National Epidémology Centre.
Many hospitals also make the economy on desinfectors.
A MRSA infection has been diagnosed in the HIV hospital service.
The bacteria in antibiotics has been detected on a hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The disease was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The wound of a serious car accident has been issued from the hospital but a little time after it has been returned because of MRSA infection and, since, the doctors couldn't make him an important operation because of the bacteria situated in his body.
By 10 December this year, 1 094 hospital infections generated by a multi-responsive pathogène agent had been declared to the National Survey System of Karolina Böröcz, a doctor of the National Epidémiology Centre.
It is the number of infections caused by a multi-responsant pathogine agent who has actually been registered in hospitals and we have no information for the rest.
Alongside two thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, otherwise said by the staphylococcus gold residents at methicilline-oxacilline.
A third of people are the bacteria of the Gold Staphylococcus (SA) in their nest without the development of a disease.
The infections caused by the SA (such as angines, amygdalites, cutaneous infections, traumatic infections) react well to antibiotics, they are easily healable.
However, if antibiotics are used in extreme or inadequate manner, the bacteria, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a well-developed bacteria to antibiotics which will quickly prolifer in the bad hospital conditions.
In the case of bad provision or extended by the immunity system, this bacteria may cause serious hospital infections such as traumatic infection or septismy, older diseases, small weight or having an abuse body.
According to the Head of hospital János, there is nothing particularly in the MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily hospitals.
In particular, the infection with epidemie is not only found by MRSA or is not seeking them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The SA resists antibiotics.
"These diseases are isolated, the dream staff containing gangs and protection machines, and we have antibiotics adapted to dry them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Firstly, hospitalized diseases are reviewed if they are portraits of MRSA, but infection can not always be avoided.
The sample prelease is not in mode
The majority of MRSA infections caused by MRSA could be predicted but the current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in the guest hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-representative pathogenic agents, Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection is particularly shown in hospitals and in hospitals for older persons, hospitals should control hospitals and immediately invite MRSA’s diseases.
However, microbiological prevalence is not in the mode in Hungarian hospitals.
It must be known that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these reviews.
Most cases are seeing the day only if the MRSA infection is detected on the disease, the doctor said as a head of the epidémiological center.
The European Union has rigorous recommendations relating to the adapted use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also Hungarian directives for the healing of certain infections and syndromes.
The antibiotic therapy needs to be achieved, otherwise, microbiological reviews should be carried out in order to prevent medicine resistance, but hospitals do not always take into account.
The achievement of microbiological premiums is still more rare in ambulatory care and basic care, Karolina Böröcz reported.
Many hospitals make the economy on desinfectors
Scientist evidence shows that MRSA has proliferated from a disease to another most often by the mediator of medical personnel.
It is therefore primordial to lay your hands, put gants and protection machines. However, important lakes are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is proliferated by infection transferred by goutte inhalation and by contact. However, due to conditions in hungry hospitals, the contaminated disease can not always be isolated.
Furthermore, rooms are often full, beds are often too close to each other while in terms of epidemie, diseases should be disappeared each of the other of 1.5 metres at least.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in difficult financial situation, are economics on desinfectors, they are missing in hospitals, the diseases are many, and the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is low most demonstrable or then can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitable expenditures for social security cases, therefore we fight all against this infection.
In England, for example, the Government has established a programme to prevent or decline the impact of the MRSA.
According to the data published, the programme is effective and the MRSA infections show a tendency decreased in England.
The European Centre for Prevention and Improvement of diseases (ECDC) shows the prevention of multi-representative pathogen agents (e.g. MRSA) as well as preventing hospital infections affected by these pathogans.
The Commissioner, author of a death accident, was not in state of ivory.
The official view on the death incident caused by the Commissioner of 22th arrondation was established.
It may be excluded that the Commissioner of the 22th Arrondation, Delivery of his post since, who throwed a piton by provoking his last death, would be conducted in the state of iron or dry, reported on vendredi Attila Morvai, a port of the Public Ministry of the Capital Capital Foundation after the remarking was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which has already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before the flower
On Tuesday last, the former Commissioner of 22th arrondation broke up a man of 55 years who found his face when he turned, with his personal car, on the Cossuth Lajos Street of 22th Arrondation. The man wanted to pass through the road not through the past for pitons.
(Otherwise, the fact that he passed out the road outside the past for pitons does not constitute an attractive circumstance, according to the Road Code, a car which loves a virage must leave the pitons.)
The pieton is dead after being transferred to hospital.
Following this accident, the Commissioner released his post and requested his debt because, according to the communication of the police, that the accident had much overwhelmed it.
The investigation of this case is carried out by the Budapest Park.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner had coopted from the beginning with the judges responsible for conducting the investigation.
400 million additional euros for infrastructure
Thanos Veres, Minister of Hungarian Finance and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (BEI), signed, Friday, Budapest, three agreements of a total value of 400 million euros on a credit line to support education, transport and energy infrastructure.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget for transport and environmental projects to achieve from the Cohesion Fund, which has already been signed by the parties. This time, the contract was signed on the use of EUR 200 million.
The credit agreement of 150 million euros also concerns the budgetary funding of projects related to education.
The EIB has fully approved an amount of EUR 300 million for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million may be used later after the extension of the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million for innovation, and the State Budget will first use this project under the research and development project to achieve the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the draft line 4 of the metro was also addressed.
The Parties agreed that they would resume from the eventual amendment of the initial contract when Hongrie has completed the details of the funding of the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done on the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB granted EUR 8,4 billion to fund 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its credits according to the EURIBOR interest rate, with an 8-year-old and without the engagement committee.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate market Paradise
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, and the attention of all Europe is turned to this country of Balkans little town by the past.
What, or who has bought on this EU market, which is always less sweet but who will be quick?
Analysis of the bulgare division of Re/Max.
Currently, in the immobility, Bulgaria is the biggest goal of Eastern Europe, with its ski apartments and houses on the boat of the good sea.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and, on the side of the sea, Albéna, the "Orly Shelters", the former Sozopol and Nesebar, but they are also more to search for an immigrable in the Cavarna and Balcik region.
According to Re/Max Bulgaria, early or later, the central region of the country, i.e. Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also see the interest of investors and are also much more to buy in the smallest Russia's well-being.
Sofia, the capital, also offers tolerating opportunities, trade and office surfaces promises the highest rate of enrolment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and to be a priority destination, after the age season and the winter season, also in the two other seasons of the year.
The most monitoring investors already buy a lot, for example, in the banksko coin.
According to the analysis, people buying an immune in Bulgaria seek to change their life, their life mode.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more than Romania.
Malta and Cypriot investors are also present. At the Black Sea and in the most reputed ski stations, we traditionally find many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided in three groups, said Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People accounting for installation buying renewed immunities, at a variation rate between 50 and 100 000 euros, or for old homes, at a price of 5 to 15,000 euros, which then are renewed.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, nearly a large city, stores and generally the local doctor.
The second group includes secondary residence purchasers (after December last, Bulgaria is located among 10 first holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who will buy in hope to achieve a more average or long-term value.
The price of the capital is increased without cease because of a more stronger request.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowerest in Bulgaria, but in the past 5 years they have increased from 21% every year.
The increase of real estate prices mainly exceeds the increase in salary.
Fodor and the six percent hungry
According to the communication by Gábor Fodor, the ministry of the environment and water, the visits of professionals continued on Tuesday, but after the opening of the official, the Ministers on International Climate Systems will continue after 2012.
Experts and political men from 192 world countries will discuss the Bali roadbreak to determine the efforts to make after the period of reduction of emissions defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
Today, living discussions are conducted on this subject between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, at the time, they wouldn't want to discuss exact figures, however they were ready to sign a reduction agreement until 2020 of serre gas emissions from 25 to 40 per cent compared to 1990 level.
Another important issue of the Conference is to see whether developed countries are involved, without reduction of emissions, to provide financial and technical assistance to countries needed.
A agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The Kyoto Protocol ' s assistance fund will be managed by a Administration Board of 16 members probably under the United Nations Environment Fund (UNAF), reported Piac Ethiopian Profit (Marché and Profit).
Hungary's six percent
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, confirms the ambition of the EU to maintain its role of friendly vessels in global efforts to protect climate and encourage the signature of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was engaged to reduce its gas emissions from 20 per cent at the 1990 level, independently of the success of the “According Agreement” after 2012, and was ready to reduce them up to 30 per cent if the other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were ready to take commitments appropriate to their responsibilities and capacity.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997 the Kyoto Protocol signing countries had been totally reduced by 5,2 per cent and the whole 15 EU members of that time had an commitment to 8 per cent.
Hungary has an obligation to reduce serre gas emissions from 6 per cent compared to the level of the 1985- 1987 period, our country will comply with its commitment, remind the press communication of the Ministry of Environment.
The enterprise is large in Bali because the long-term climate policy agreement should be established in the intervalle of two years, unless the entry into force of the Agreement would certainly be repealed after 2012. In this case, the United Nations peace-related obligations under the values set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system for emission reduction of which the need has been signed in the new report of the IPCC, international scientific body, which has obtained the Nobel price of the United Nations peace, in order to cover climate change.
The reduction of emissions would be reduced and the increase in the average temperature of the earth more than 2 degrees of cell could not be avoided, which, according to scientists, would be extremely serious and irvokable consequences.
The British Army recruited on YouTube
The units of the British Army communicate, on the video sharement site, records carried out during its operations in Iraq and in Afghanistan in the aim of become popular.
First of all, this is the British Air Force (RAF) suffering for YouTube: special units in Afghanistan and charge video sequences on taliban operations since March 2006, BBC announced.
These records, taking the support of miniature cameras mounted on the case, are controlled in the general area of the air force operations in Kandahar and then are transferred to London or the partners loading them on the Internet.
Political message is uncontaminable
The air force soldiers have already been 139 follow-ups on the network by that way and their "chain" were looked by more than 75,000 people.
The British Defence Minister was included in the name of the "Defence-quarters" on the spring 2007 and reported videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq also have their own chains on YouTube.
Mission and Afghan
According to the initial goal of the air force, the videos were passed on the network to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they also served to know the real objectives of the army's presence in the foreign.
The proliferation published by this way does not practically cost nothing compared to the usual recruitment publications of the television, to communicate BBC Gordon Mackenzie, consulting in defence, and inevitably brings a political message as it is justified in a special form of the military operations decided by the Government.
Americans did a game
The army is embraced because, horrorly composed and censured videos, amateur videos are passed on the shared site that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the “official” films, a little hypocrite, the officers are not allowed to speak of loss but they never present the blood side of the fight.
Furthermore, many videos had already been on the network with operation zones in Iraq and Afghanistan who were carried out in real mission, but the British army was packed for the load of these videos for a few years.
Americans make the recruitment a little differently by using the fusillade game of America's Army free downloading. In this game the player can get directly on the place of soldiers in the framework of a more or less real simulation.
Holy Sepulchre and Joints in the Ministrys
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Lamperth, seems not to be sensitive: instead of celebration of Christmas, she will hold a yearend meeting with its collaborators that will be able to say to be added in 2007 by taking tickets and coffee.
Another ministry will organize a festival with a live music, another will love officials with a tomb and offer a glass to create a Christ's ambition.
Fruit, ambition of Christmas, concerts and buffets, thus divorce the power.
The public authorities also prepare Christmas.
This year, the largest day of Christmas will be organized by the Ministry of Defence but not the employees of the Ministry who will be invited.
At Christ, the Orphelins, the children of the fellow soldiers will receive cadals for the Missionary Christmas, soldiers members who are currently served in foreign missions are invited and a press receipt will also be placed.
The Department provides a budget of 25 million for the establishment of the end of the year.
In comparison with other departments, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM's feast will be held in the future House with a total budget of 4 320 000 fortress and, at the six hundred employees in large, three hundred fifty there are expected.
At this festival, Christ's ambition will be riding, there will be actors and also a tomb.
The NFÜ Christmas costed 4 700 000 foreign and was organized in the building of the National Justice Council (OIT) with concerts and dinner.
The location of the room has costed a million forbits, and the remaining was paid for more than four hundred invited.
According to our information, a NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas vacation, which is organized with the European money by the National Economic Development Centre, the Management Society of Offers.
The building of the Toast of the Guestatea was lowered to these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to join the responsible.
Cost is not binding
The construction of the OIT was not only the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which organized a balloon at the time of the Holy Luca on 7 December.
The OIT has not paid them to use its rooms.
This ballo was about five hundred people.
The feast started by the words of welcome of the Minister and dinner was followed by a dancing night on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: the dinner holding was not all obligation to this ballo.
The Ministrys of Health, Working and Local Communities provide a overall feast.
The Ministry of Health will organize a spectrum and a party to his employees in its walls for 400 000 forbits.
On the other hand, Monika Lamperth, Minister of Lamperth, does not invite its employees to a Christmas party but to a year-end working meeting.
A hundred and eighteen people are expected who will be invited to take a coffee and eat angles, reported the press service, and the feast will cost 350 000 forts.
Gordon Byanai, the Minister of Local Communities, will simply invite its collaborators to take a glass in the office of the Ministry of Local Communities and territorial Defense.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its large room at 436 employees.
The account offers 2 500 supplies by invitation with a buffet and a white.
Since the arrival of János Veres, the PM employees celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No feast ambition planned, the official character is strengthened not only by the exposed of the Minister but also by the hour of the feast in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a receipt on 20 January to celebrate the new year, the Christmas feast will not be done.
The receipt will be held at the Vajdahunyad Chamber, located in the wood of the town, and according to the communication of the Ministry, 1 000 persons per person are calculated for the hundreds of invites.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which foreign accreditability diplomats will only be invited to Hungary.
These cocktails, organized every year, are enthusished by some words of welcome of the Minister followed by a modest feast.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Cultural Training did not celebrate all the Christmas, reported to [origo] respective pressure services.
The press service of the Ministry of Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the festival organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega are gathered together
The Ligue Syndicats and the National Association of Opening Boards will be the Friday of their Guinea Committee for the Coordination of the Undetermined Monday.
Summit, a general protesting meeting will be held and Monday, on the day of the final vote on health cases, the grape will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant buckets in the movement because the rail traffic will be almost completely arrested and BKV employees (common transport association) will also be held up to 13:00.
The syndicats of the ligue will be able to know, Friday after midday, the details of their Monday grade, organized with the National Association of Opening Boards.
LIGA - MOSZ will also be formed, and it will serve the computer of Monday actions.
Samedi, a general protesting meeting will be held and from Monday the organizations will stop work for an unlimited period if they are not able to find agreement with the Government.
This means that the date of the end of the wheel, from the day of vote in parliament on health care, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the health case law, the syndicats will immediately receipt the call to the green.
However, if the law is voted, the Greek Commissions will be gathered and decided to be taken.
According to the agenda of Monday of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on health cases was only afternoon, evening night.
Following the Monday's threshold, significant buckets are planned in the movement: iron roads will stop work for an unlimited period and a part of the Common Transport to Budapest and more than half of Volan's companies can be arrested.
At the same time, at different points of the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many syndicates and civil organizations joined the call to the Greece, the list of them is permanently updated on the Ligue website.
Some organizations have reported that the burden for an undetermined period, others have declared an temporary work stop.
To Thursday after middle the MÁV (Hungary iron feet) and the SSZSZ SSZ Syndicat (VDSZZ) has not been able to find a minimum services agreement, or, at the approach of Christ's festivals, most of those who take the train.
According to the current communications, the Budapest Common Transports will be held from the start of service until 13:00, the Budapest Airport between 7 and 9:00 a.m., the Industrial Syndicats of Electricity and the Thermal Energy of Ligue will be four hours, the Teachers Syndicate and the Democracy of Teachers' Syndicats have called for bearing respectively on 2 hours and 2 hours to 8 hours.
The National Medicinal Association will take heed in all the sponsorship country, the Health and Social Sectoral Syndicat (EDDSZ) ratified to SZEF will have an advertising age of two hours.
The most important of the four returns made by the Ligue requires the Government to reply its proposal on the reform of health and substitutes a new concept in the social debate.
The second recovery requires the new method of calculation of the pension to place from the next year to be introduced in several steps.
The third recovery wants a safeguard, in retaining before the legal age, which would allow for the system to carry out its functions before 2010.
The fourth motive of the action is the rejection of the League Syndicat (VDSZSZ), ratified by the Lingue Syndicats, the proposal of the Ministry of Economic and Transport on Second Raillines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Garde has increased the country’s risk
According to the Political Capital Analysing Division (Risk Analysing Division), the activity of the Hungarian Garde, established in August, with the support of Jobbik Magyarországetet Mozgalom (Movement for a better Hungary) increased in several aspects of the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its “risk warning”, the company states that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Garde, the largest political risk is already that “in short terms of the aggressive aggressive disappearances can result in the aggravation of ethnic tension already existing between the Twenty and the non-Twenish population of Hungary.”
The research Institute added that the Hungarian Political Guarantee Strategy is indeed the main reason.
As they say, this is one of the main lacunes of the Hungarian political actors: “Publics have held the public debate on Rome's case to representatives of radic and extreme political groups based on a political strategy on dispute between Thensians and Hungarians”.
The problem is enlarged, the normal dialogue becomes impossible, the extremists are enhanced and the attractive conflicts are more likely to say.
However, according to the research Institute, under the effect of the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Garde has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary to the foreign, particularly regarding the trust in the stability and democracy of the country.
They recall that, following a greater publicity given to the reorganisation of the Hungarian and extreme right groups since August 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the age of 2007 to give the name of the national self-defence association.
“The common trafficking of these meetings is that they are defined as a civil organization while they publicly explain the preparation of their adherents to defence missions (catastrophes, national defence, the defence of the order), armed, if it is necessary, to surround, declaring the ability of the police, of the army, otherwise said of the state.”
They reported that everything was followed by the method that, based on the ransom of political society and parties, seeks to decrease various political ambitions under a civil aspect.
The accent on civil nature and the association status is therefore only to avoid legal posts of registration of these associations in the court but also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis reports that the Hungary Garde activity is a factor that also increases risks in relation to neighbouring relations.
“In the last months, many neighbouring countries have the Hungarian Garden as a potential risk source and the ultra-national political actors of some limited countries wish to justify their anti-honority policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Garde.
These influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research Institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Garde is not a unique phenomenon in Central Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they said, the operation of the Hungarian Garde appears, for example, to the activities of the National Bulgarian Garde of which the Constitution has been declared by the National Bulgaria Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many troubles in Roms, who have entered into a Sophia village (Kraszna Poljana) are originating the constitution of Bulgarian guards.
In benefit of these events, the UNDP decided to be observed by saying that the objective of the organization is " national defence".
According to them, in the last 17 years, twentians have “terroused” Bulgaria but the state remained inactive and neutral, remember the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had followed vife discussions in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As they said, the declaration of certain Bulgarian Roms organizations on the establishment of their own career in resistance stipulates an increase in the risk of ethnic disappearances.
The functioning of the Hungarian Garde showing similarities with the national Bulgarian Garde does not exclude that the Hungarian Romans respond to the threat of the same manner by organizing their own defence, may be read in the warning of political Capital risk.
At the request for information of the Telegraphic Agency, Attila Juhász, Political Research Director, said: The risk analysis is one of the research Institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events could have a impact on the change of risk, they report the public opinion, as in this case, by publishing a risk warning.
The feast is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the feast days and, around the feasts, it has become current to reorganise the working days of which the number will reduce the next year.
The feasts are not uniform in the EU and in the United States.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes the day of national and state festival as well as the days of rest.
The rest days are often related to religious feasts or important historic events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the new year that ends and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, so that the latest time that the surveyers may be quietly relaxed.
Furthermore, in one year, we've been marked in all ten red feasts.
On 15 March, it is a national feast, in memory of the revolution of 1848, as well as the Commonwealth Day of the 1956 Revolution.
On 20 August, we hold the constitution of our state, on 1 May is the working feast and 1 and 2 November, we remember members of our family and of our dead friends.
Furthermore, we have two days at Pasqua, the Pentecost and Christ.
The days of our state festival, national or other religious feasts ran rarely on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become now to reorganize the works days in cases or there is only one day working before or after the red marked feast.
It is true that we pay the price of the weekend extended in workers or going to school the Saturday before the week-end.
For many years, the minister of work states in a special regulation on the days of replacement of the days before or after the feasts.
The law is extended to all employees and their employees, officials and employees in the public service.
It does not, however, belongs to services societys, institutions turning without interruption and service, by vocation, and also for the days of rest.
This year, working days will be amended only around the end of year: since 24 December, life is almost stopped throughout the country, because according to the experiences, most people make more hours or take holidays that they have been emerging for these purposes to take the days between Christ and the new year.
In the next year, many festivals fall within the middle or at the end of the week, therefore there will be less changes at the level of work days than this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the first time around the working festival to allow employees to stay at them four days of divorce.
On Saturday 25 April, it will be a day of work for a breakfast on Friday 2 May.
Another change is planned for 23 October: Saturday, 18 October, will be a workday replaced on Friday 24.
Nevertheless, the next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of feasts because from 24 December, everyone will have a non-stop stop even if the new one falls on a Friday.
Six strong things that can embrace the colleagues terriblely
E-mails we forgot to send, vocal messages that we never receive, innocent lies that are almost more: these are things that are " embalking" the daily of a workplace.
The question is to know whether these weaknesses are attained or addressed to the challenge and consciously avoiding the ambiguous situations, caused to the others.
Examples.
"Don't be sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were called on the marketing service," said a college.
What did you get to do?
The best he is sorry and try to arrang the things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (these is the least current solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before having a penal explanation, it is useful to figure out how you can cause inadequate moments to your colleagues and to make efforts to avoid them.
Do you get something that doesn't be you?
There is nothing else that you want to take a folder, a office tool or telephone, and you can't find them any part.
Do you remember that the veil you put it on the office but she lost the next morning?
You're gonna find your stole that you'd believe that you lost your colleague's office?
Don't take nothing to your colleagues without asking, but they have reasoned to be hurt against you because they have shot their goods.
Don't return the packs, then post it into your pocket, because it can be embracing that there is no more and that you need it soon.
You're a little bit of the private life of the colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop pots that offer.
What did he do with him?
And why?
Don't tell everyone your information (suppositions) about the private life of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his secrets with you, don't obey his trust!
Please enter in you shared information and don't discuss it with your colleagues in its absence even if your colleagues are also present.
You're telling you sick without just reason?
When you call the office and tell you that you are sick in the pretext of a hair of head misses because you feel bad or you think you need to rest that day, think that your work, your urgent business, your missions must be carried out by one of others on your place.
Don't make nice to your colleagues!
If you know at the advance that you're not going to work next morning or something that can happen to you to stay in your house, don't forget to prevent your chief and colleagues to avoid that they're disappearing from your absence on the next day.
Fashion, Round, Telephone
You're going to be in your work, but you're making your colleagues a lot of crazy?
You have become, without the desire, witness of a telephone debate that you'd better make you not listen to?
Don't disappoint your colleagues with freundings, singings, high voice discussions (when you lead above their head), feet battles, big words or comprehenses expressed with high voice.
They may even delay if your colleagues are not engaged in a project (reaction, design, organization).
Do you accuse the others for a fault?
If your job is not done for the specified time, you forgot to send a mail or an important message, you don't accuse anyone for this forgotten!
Don't put it on the account of the evental chaos in the office or your bruying colleagues!
Acknowledge him if you have done a fault and if it has presented inconvenents for the others, reveal the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault, repair the neglect!
You feel too much at the office?
Put a jogging and chausing is comfortable at the house but they don't come to the office!
Don't put comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Don't be denied, respect your colleagues and yourself in your own living correctly, and if your function requires it by putting fine and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to answer the expectations, you're not interesting.
We are slowly progressing in the usual morning bucket.
At the same time, a special melody is listed to the radio: the voice of a violon to which electronic effects are linked.
I'm moving up the son.
The rhythm music changes and the low comes to gather the tons from all the time, then a female cohoral comes to join it as a true blue.
Mr2 differs the Sonson Wings of Love de Zagar.
Hungarian musical life hasn't disappointed us for long with a good quality pop.
But now it appears to be different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, a few new interesting productions born from the dark digital land, start a little bit to change the entire image and, despite the new mode of garage rock that hit the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is new under the sun.
Balazs Zságer came from Pécs and he played himself in the Yonderboi group before he launched on his own way, perhaps because " there's no place for two feet in the same chaos."
His project (Zagar) and its music, a jazz flat, electronic dancing music and pop music, began to know when it was confidenced to the composition of filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The Ferenc Törük season.
Training began to be known by a greater public, when the wan2 magazine citated their first album of 2002 among the 50 most important honggrosy market disks and called Zagar, with Yonderboi, almost the only creators of the Hungarian Tendency, who would also be competitive in the West.
Zagar and its together have become unconscious "trendy" but no one asked them if they wanted to take this label.
The group reacted as needed, he went out a new and better disk.
The album entitled Can Walk Fly Instead, recently out, can open new ways for them, although the title desires to be a continuity with the past years in the Pécs.
That was a line of the old Pécs of Balaz Zságer.
We are well there with the flight reference but next to the air music now appears, according to the spirit and the tendance of time, the stronger guitar, the impact of rock and rol.
Gyrgy Ligeti, who now worked in England with the Puzzle Group, showed his talent in these songs during the first album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real tube for the radio, Mr.2 Petífi, diffusing from a few of the populary music from the morning to the evening, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six hungry singers ("Underground Divas").
So, it's okay.
hvg.hu asked questions to Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube allowed me to ask a question: Is your music well left a music for a certain sleep?
Zságer Balázs: The term of music about a certain cocket doesn't tell me a great thing.
For me there are two casts in the light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and synchron music.
Musics themselves say alternatives, underground may also be medicines and do only for sale and become commercial.
But a good pop pop song may also be sincere.
The reception attitude also functions in this spirit independently of the language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign public, is one or another open to your music?
Z.B.: In the foreign, especially in the western western music has more old traditions.
People are going to concerts and not only young people of a ten-year-old, but also the elderly.
They follow with much more attention the changes undertaken in the light music because they believe that it is also part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who or how many people listen to your music?
Z.B.: I'm obviously happy to see that people come from more to our concerts.
However, we have never done music for the market.
The music is not done to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts or mutual influence is already working, but it is only in the unseassible changes of time.
But I noticed that if you wanted to answer the public expectations, you wouldn't be interested.
hvg.hu: Do you have your accounts follow the Yonderboi example?
He's working alone and made carrière rather than west.
Z.B.: We do not really follow his way even if some are trying to find traces in our music.
We're rather players in teams who have trusted the musical presence of the other and we're deployed.
At first, he was inevitable that our music would be compared to the Yonderboi's music because we are many to leave his group and take another way.
hvg.hu: On the palm of Mr.2 Petífi, Wings of Love takes the first place.
Many are those who have heard the name of Zagar for the first time by the way of this song.
With this more popular style, have you been opened in consciously to a larger bed?
Z.B.: We don't plan to make a tube to sell the disk.
This song wants to say more things.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to adhere the sound organ and the hardest topics addressed throughout the disc.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six songs?
Why, what was the direct line?
Z.B.: The idea was having a cohoral of the genre of gospel.
We had the idea of composing this cohoral of good ordinances of the Hungarian musical scene.
So it was formed to six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikć Hodosi [Neo], Juci Neemeth, who then had been baptized under Territory Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like this or the girls have changed it a little?
Z.B.: This piece was already already in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought it was still missing something about this song.
The follow-up of agreements took the voice of the song.
I shouted the night even the melody like the girls learned later.
I had it almost all right and everything was terriblely spontaneed.
I remember that galvanized me at the time, but we were sure we needed Divas.
With my voice, she wouldn't have the same force.
hvg.hu: On the disc and the concert, he also felt that girls were behind.
There is no only (excluding a short of Judy Jay), they have no only role, they can't cry together and they don't sound stronger than music, so music does not only accompani their song.
They were behind on the scene too.
Do you want it?
Z.B.: The fact that they were behind is only to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary is that we didn't want to distribute the roles of solest.
The song also says that we need to forget a little our ego, forget who comes from here, who goes or, we must just let these flowers, the flowers of love, bear us.
I wanted the others to feel like this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: What of the songs made you the most work?
Z.B.: truly, we have had more difficult pieces in the migue.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play in a concert plan, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the Groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, small, everything has been placed as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Z.B.: This changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I have already left this disc.
At that time, this is the prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader perfids from milliards because of its incertainty complex
A dissummulator.
This means its old employed French gender, the General Society, the Czech Bank owner of the Comerční Bank.
The bank lost about five billion euros because of him.
But it seems that Kerviel is only a large player who wanted to equality his colleagues, and that, above all, can not be considered as uncapable.
In contrast to all the large bank houses, he at time recognized the crisis of the American hypothec market.
"It's fraud," they left to listen to her highests that had been designed to the police.
However, if the deposition of Kerviel was reported by the French media, including the World, the transactions of this person have produced a benefit last year at 1,6 billion euros.
Crisis over the United States
"All I wanted, it was winning money for my bank," said he in the deposition.
The last age, he has been able to benefit from the American crisis to win a half-milliard of euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity since the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February as the hypotheks said "sub-prese", granted to low income clients or to those who had occurred in the past of reimbursement difficulties would be problems.
But this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe there, and he was well missed.
Thus, at the end of the year, its benefits rised to €1,6 billion.
"When I had gained my first half-milliard, I didn't know how to announce it," trusted Kerviel and added that he hadn't heard anything for himself."
In all the questionnaire, he advised the reports to not be transferred.
He succeeded to doubt his highest, although the Eurex busse started interesting its transactions.
Who does not risk anything
Did he be discovered?
I don't.
"I assumed the simple fact that the bank had got 1,6 billion satisfied."
Where is his will to risk so gross?
He has been gradually at his post.
He began to work at the General Society in 2000 just after the end of his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, it was already an assistant to trade and, in 2005, became an independent trade with an annual payment of $90,000.
But he knew he would never win as much as others.
"In 2005, I knew I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university cursus and of my professional and personal course, Kerviel has explicited the investigators.
But, a little after his income work, he reports his first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he gained a half-milliard of euros by lacking on the decrease of this title attractions in London.
And the mechanism was discovered - he wanted more.
Until you win, you will leave in peace.
"There had a black effect," he said to the police.
But the highest were in the sense of everything, or rather, they did.
"That I gained, they looked like closing the eyes."
But it's then the end of the year.
He lost a milliard of euros on one day.
On the middle of June, after weekend, it decides to cover the sum.
Lundi, when he comes to work, is no longer employed from the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did we find it?
He became suspect because of his congestion.
"The past year, I took only four days of congency.
A trader who does not take vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another", concludes Kerviel.
Czech Republic at the opportunity to get 365 billion
The Ministers of the Czech Government have signed in all 9 operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion of Czech Republic) to the Czech Republic.
It is at least the half of the total sum that Tschechy can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion quarters issues of seven operational programmes will be designed to the Czech regions.
Czech enterprises can get approximately 100 billion krones within the framework of the Entreprise and innovation program.
The transport sector will be greater than 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the most important operational program and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial means that the Czech can be obtained within the framework of these projects.
This money will be on the basis of an increase in the National Transport infrastructure budget, which will lead to the next year a sum of 90,8 milliards of kitchens.
The Enterprise and innovation program, aimed at PM and entrepreneurs, should serve to get financial means to encourage innovation within the company.
Business should provide financial means for the introduction of new technologies, research in the industry, but also for the introduction of new more effective management methods.
Until now, the Czech Reply participated, among the new members, the EU funds benefits the least round of success.
The Court confirmed the penalty of 20 years of prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed the penalty of 20 years of prison for the former President of the country Arnold German, which was condemned in 2003 for an offence of $100 million ($1,8 billion).
But later he was released and lived in his residence in the middle of the Nicaragua capital.
If the former head of the United States centre, in line between 1997 and 2002, or not again incarnated, in accordance with the AP Agent, is not clear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, all will now depend on prison officers, or they will leave Aleman to end his punishment at him or will go again in prison.
Four years ago, the Court proved that Eleman regularly delayed the money of the Government to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
It was fruity society and accounts in reality depended on the family members and the closest partners.
A part of this money was gone into the funds which the German had created to finance its electoral campaign in 2001.
The budget has been adopted
That's it.
The State Budget was adopted.
What is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the majority of the government without supporting the opposition.
The present year has been a year ago thanks to the support of the Tschech Socialist Party - μSSD, because it was the Sobotka Minister who had prepared it and μSSD could not allow him to be rejected.
In contrast to the negotiated discussion before the vote of the Government's challenge declaration, this time, nothing of dramatic.
The Deputy Chamber adopted, without any problem, this law which, although the most influence, is usually rejected.
That's a sort of paradoxe.
That the veil or not, each chapter and article is the beginning and the end of all governments.
The Budget is a part of the policy, whereas it covers the competence of a government and opposition.
This is more attractive to media and is therefore more attention in the media.
The disputes of political men are much more interesting in the opinion than the abrupted numbers.
The national budgets of the past socialist Governments suffered of three mass that the current budget is not intended to regulate at the time:
The first is the important part granted to the costs of mandates imposed by the law, not only by pensions, but also by social charges adopted by the last year by the "coalition" silence grouping the parties ≤SSD and KS月M.
The second is a deficit economic, resulting from the first evil.
The third barrier is the deficit of public finance, i.e. by the deficit of cities and communities.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the largest ala.
This is public and relatively under control.
The real afternoon bomb is the deficit of cities and communities.
Many of the monkeys were often evaluated with the obligations, which, in turn, decrease their municipalities in order to obtain money from taxes, tax rights and bank credits, new investment sources.
In the past few years, they were successful to reimburse these debts by the mass sale of the distribution systems, including those of the energy gained from the State under privatization.
Today, they don't have this source.
If there are only official and verificational facts, it is noted that:
Our economy has been over several years, even as the rest of the world, a growth phase and 周SSD is not lacking to sell it.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
But, instead of that, they enthusied the State more.
Any other countries, which have made some exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their business in a more reasonable way than our Republic.
It is a monstery shame that is essentially resolved on the previous governments.
We are part of countries who, at the global level, are less threatened by poverty.
We therefore don't need massive social programmes, which are just in the past years, unfortunately enlarged.
Although it has been successful to remove a part of the absurd people's expenses, approved in the past year before the elections, if a decrease of the age limit for the pension, and a reform of the pension system will no longer be placed, then any policy will stop existing in this country and whatever will be able, it will only be managed.
Examples can be said that political men will become officers who are mechanicly distributing the majority of money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
This is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only sustain the mechanism that ordinary costs are repealed by the costs of mandate.
The deficit of 70 billion planned for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if the previous governments had not disappeared all the money they could.
If we really don't want that it comes that the policies to become simple officers, we need to be patients and to grant this fragile government coalition, knowing that the State can only exempt the equivalent of what it comes to impose in fiscal impôts and rights, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
There is only the latest that will achieve a progressively balanced state budget.

Banks want to resolve the crisis
The US Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Switzerland and Canada decided to fight together the financial market crisis.
More than 100 billion dollars will so be placed on monetary markets through the shopping markets.
This will be for the banks to sell, through a purchase system, the interest rates they are ready to undertake money.
For example, the United States Fed will send to the buyers $40 billion and will also provide 24 billion to the European Central Banks and the Swiss.
It is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States decided to take action at this point to prevent, even to reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This start is attempting to address the major problems of the economy, namely the lack of growing capitals that banks could provide", is written in his report to Bernard Baumohl customers of the Economic Advisory Group.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks reduced the probability of a recession to the United States from 65 per cent to approximately 50 percent," added Baumohl in its report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of non-rebursed loans, especially in the United States.
The analysis are still waiting for other loss in milliards.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this start, it is that they must really appreciate what can still be done," said the economicist as a Chief of Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," adds.
The Central Banks fear that, if banks themselves have a difficult access to the loans, they will provide better for their customers.
This would reduce the consumption and extend the American economy in a recession that would affect the economic growth of the whole world.
The Central Banks have made this choice after the fact that it has not succeeded to reduce London interbancing rate, called LIBOR, used to operate on the inter-bancing market.
This means that banks were always fearing mutual impressions, although the Central, Canadian and English Central Banks have reduced several times, during the automne, their interest rates.
"This will have the same effect as a new decline of interest rates," said the Reuters Greg Salvaggio of the Tempus Consulting Society.
Some analysts do not believe that the starting of Central Banks will not contribute to the crisis, since it does not resolve the main problem that is the short-term market in the United States.
President Klaus: The discussions of ecologicalists are incredible
Global climate changes are particularly nervous to developing countries.
The President Václav Klaus again spoke on the problem of the planning reappearing.
Criticals have been attacked this time on the United Nations International Conference on Climate Changes in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The blue planet not green, he stated that the discussions of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, this is not only the structure of the conference, which is a curious mechanism of representatives of Governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable but also the basis difference between the government and the reality.
"The debate is not structured in all things, it is only a breach of words, replace solutions to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed that his subject was a great importance for him, and that is why he is so involved in this cause.
He also showed its pleasure of what his book would also appear in the German translation, as he said, "I often see only the loading of my opinions".
However, interested persons can read their positions without deformation.
Klaus recalled that although he is not climate, he has, however, enough of provisions to edit such a book.
In fact, it is an academic capable of follow-up and appreciation of scientific treaties, the practice of the statistics, and it is also economic.
The major conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following thèses: the evolution climate, the changes of this are normal, so there is no view shared by all researchers on the planetary reappearance, the effects of current changes are too important or too serious, so they do not represent any danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence the climate evolution are ineffective, ineffective and inadequate costs.
As a result of the experience of a total regime, it is not acceptable to impose unprecedented views to the others, what it feels like a dangerous damage to freedom.
In response to the questions of the persons present, he explained to several remarks that it was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integral environment that does not take into account the relationship between costs and the benefit they provide."
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this issue two months ago, at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people haven't succeeded to renew their allowance to lead in time
Six hundred thousand leaders have left to expire the time and have not been able to renew their old permit to lead the validity of the end of the year.
We are the last day when people can still ask the renewment, so that the authorities are able to release a new permission before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry did not fear that hundreds of thousands of leaders without valid allowances would undermine the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their permission to lead mostly those who do not want to lead.
While the communities report a number of requests for renewing the license, the authorities in the capital are retained from requests and the number of requests for renewing the licence was growing this week.
Mauria satisfies about 2000 customers daily.
There's a half-hour cut off.
In Prague, nearly 140.OO conductors have not yet renewed their permission to lead.
The delivery of a new permission takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request delivery within a dismissed period of five days.
In this case, the conductor pays a supplement of five krones.
Vehicle drivers that will not be able to do the obligatory renewing of the allowance to lead from this year to the end of the year and we will press the road without a valid allowance, will risk a amendment since the month of January.
The offence will be granted to pay two thousand krones at maximum.
However, the police may also treat the infraction by using a friendly start.
In the case of an administrative offence, the ambassador grimps 2500 krones.
According to old information, a person could even amend a person who would not be circumcised.
It could be bound to pay up to 30,000 krones.
The Department had called the authorities to modify and put amendments not over 1000 krones.
However, according to the Port-Party Department of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one is likely to have changed in ten thousands.
The license to lead is, according to him, a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not like with the identity card that it must be valid without exceptions.
Persons who don't want to lead more should give their permission to lead.
It's enough to add it or to send it to the corresponding municipality.
The allowances of delivery between 1964 and 1993 will be valid at the end of the year.
Nevertheless, vehicle drivers are also contrary to progressively renew other types of leading permit.
Persons who have documents from 1994 to 2000 have still three years to implement the renewment.
The validity of delivery allowances in 2001 to 2004 expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million of other documents.
The Court has reduced the punishment of detections paid with Berdych
Josef Opva and Petr Ko nețțaaík, older police officers who are accused of conniveness with David Berdych's gang, will be thirty and ten years of prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague has thus condemned them definitively by reducing their penalties respectively for 1 years and 2 years.
Originally, the Department ' s Detective for Crime against the Organized Crime was punishment of 14 and 12 years of prison.
It is no longer possible to call against the complained sentence today, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is expected.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, it is expected for the moment as the deputy of first instance.
However, it has already received in other cases of punishment which the sum exceeds 16 years of prison.
He can't receive any more.
In January, the Department Court has recognized complaints for the participation of holdings 19 persons, the Supreme Court today treated the appeal interactions of 16 of them.
Most infringements reiterated since the beginning of the investigation in question by claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Court of Justice, the police members, after another agreement with Berdych, transmitted the crimes of information from the police sources, covered the various hold-up and assisted the gang members to avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang was 30 percent of the lacerin in Opva and Koa月aík.
In the accused, there is a question of the delictive activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
It is significantly the military flights in which victims, in most cases, have caused serious damage to health, but also the abuse of power of a public agent and arms prohibited.
During the home investigation, the police discovered illegally detained weapons, obises with a skin noya, a visa for the direct layer or a metrailette.
According to the accused, the gang has been rich of ten million kitchens.
Besides a twentieth men of this proceeding, the courts have already recognized crimes of other main flights, Berdych and all a series of other people.
Other men of Berdych neighbourhood are still explained before the court in another proceedings, some cases have not yet arrived until the court.
The main audience has, for the time, avoided Tomáš P月ta and Maroš âulej, who are currently detentioned in Ireland, where they are waiting for the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of the substitution of children: 12 million
Avocate of unorganized families Igor Veleba wants to get from the hospital of Tívitič a decline of 12 million curons more costs.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for parents, and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of $200,000 for each of the parents.
That is why the lawyer of the hospital Ond月ej Dostál is absolutely not agreed with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such reward, that is very high," said Dostala at the outcome of the audience.
"To be the same view of the contra-proposal, we need the expert report of which the adverse party has commanded the editation.
We'll check if this has some explicative value.
But we continue to think that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands of thousands," said Dostala.
The amount should, according to him, be fixed between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablo's family had asked a million krones for each month where she could not endeavour her biological girl.
Veleba served the expert report for him by the university hospital centre in Prague-Motol, as a document on support for debt negotiations.
According to psychological and psychology experts, parents have caused psychological damage and were stressed in different scales and deep.
Stress situation was better supported by men, although they had been confronted with the orders that they had not to prevent the replacement of new people.
Women, remaining less serious before the life of traumatism in the newspaper and before what happens precisely at this time, resumed the content of the Veleba report.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurse in the hospital of Tíbíč on 9 December last.
The past week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola at the ◆ermák in Pãibyslavice and Veronika at Libor Bro 周 and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jablo 周ov.
The Governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystračil, final October, reimbursed to each of the 100,000 coron families for the reimbursement of expenditures resulted in the error of the hospital of Tíč, which was managed by the region.
All hospitals in Czech Republic are imposed by law to civil liability.
In the case of lack, they must put into the reservation fund, exclusively, they may ask for a warrant's assistance.
The courts recognized relatively few debts, calculated according to the tables were the order of hundreds of thousands, exclusively millions.
Polyvka lost Valašské Královstvi (The Kingdom of Valašsko)
Boek Polívka lost the litter on Valašské královstv (Royaume de Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Regional Court of Ostrava, he was effectively used for the first time by the King of Valašsko, but the project was set by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, the former partner of the actor.
Polivka was not present at today's audience.
But according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will call.
"The litter concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team stand on the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said after the lawyer of Polívka.
According to him, the words of the Kingdom of Valašsko are just this actor and comic.
Harabiš is the same opinion.
"There's a job of almost ten years behind us.
He said the search for money and development at the point of events.
According to him, the money is the cause of the leather.
"Thanks of years, they found that the project has successful and could benefit.
They are those who want to paralyze on our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the Court, it is Polivka who was used for the first time the title of Valašský král (Roi de Valašsko) in its television emission.
Radoslav Brzobohatý cut him King in 1993.
But at the time, this was not a relationship with the project to set up a green Kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea to make passports from Valašské Královstvi.
A luxuristic action to the origin has been conducted a business and a lucrative trade activity, followed by Harabiš, the Valašské královstvi society.
In 1997, Polivka accepted its name and signature to be found in the passenger, and even proposed the guards of the money holders on the price of the visit of his closed and the theatre spectrum.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš had only been using the nest idea published by Polívka in the handed emission for trade purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka has certainly helped the draft Valašské královstvi," said the judge.
However, she added that the soul of the project was formed by Harabiš and its team that would be dedicated to the project intensely.
Co-operation between the enemies today continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized a formal trial in Polyvka.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which have culminated with the deposition "The King Boleslav 1 elected forever."
The leading role in the Kingdom was then under the inspiration of Harabiš, the songs of Jarmila úlllakova as Reine.
Then, in 2002, Polyvivka complained against Harabiš and its society, requested the court to reject today.
What could shoot the case clearly is the turnoi planned for the throne and half of the prince.
He should get out of it a new king.
He didn't want to get the details and date.
"We don't want to go quickly.
It would be something like the kings' challenge in Slovak.
The king would have chosen for some time.
Even Mr Polívka can, of course, record," added Harabiš.
Peugeot Test 207 SW 1.6 VT: Prejudice Disturbation
I mean, I've never been a great fan of Peugeot 206.
His road qualitys were nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, conduct and also of the manufacturing could be qualified by the average of frequency.
But now on the market is his successor the Peugeot 207 who, she, is very better.
Since the SW combine is still a step far away, it's still more than thinking better.
When I triggered the classic hachback of the Peugeot 207 I plagued, for example, the space for the head on the back seats.
While it ends the complaints because the combine carrier means that even the great devils will, in this regard, be at the same time.
Let's see fast done.
I'll be talking about the inside so I'm not too fast to repay.
It is a little successful design, my only comment on the central tunnel that appears to me poor.
There, I'd like a little more inventive design, since the car was just awful.
The seats are comfortable and the time you could be complained from seats or short folders is restarted.
The bilateral guidance has also been fully improved in comparison with the 206 model.
With regard to space, the increase in carbon sizes is also significant there.
The combine also seems to disappear the lack of place above the head already mentioned.
A cover in the cover
The most important on this vehicle, therefore, is its bags to bags.
I need to assess this as a very good accessible (directly through the backening glass) and a pretty easy image.
The blind spaces are municipios of the ceiling elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not encombrant and may be extended as it is capable of keeping hard objects.
But let's stop us at the volume.
This makes, in accordance with the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, more than the competitive currency.
Withdraws the Škoda Fabia Combi, the most saled vehicle in Czech Republic.
If the 207 SW is compared with the new generation of the product by Mlada Boleslav, it is noted that Peugeot remains very sensitively behind, the difference is 52 litres.
When it comes to leave foreign or load a poussite, this figure is almost critical.
But if I had to do the benefits, I would mention the bottom of the fall that remains after the return of the homes of the back homes completely right, or a very lower walk.
120 horses divided on four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a Otto Motor of four cylinders with a volume of 1.6 l and a 88 kW power.
And truly, that should be like a 1.6 that makes a family hachback walk.
It's quiet, not little and, mostly, it's good.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by XXXCoda that often gives the impression of having a escape pot shed by a smoke, then I can only be enthousiastic.
Follow the tariffs
The price of the vehicle is not to be paid by all.
However, it must be aware that it has been tested a quite well-equipped car, with a spacious internal and a very good motor.
The base price of a vehicle with a Otto engine 1,4 litres before 329 900 Kč is still passable.
The vehicle we tested from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
The premium equipment also tested increases the price of 80 000 Kč.
But, we have more main airbags, a automatic climate, automatically spectacle, a automatic command of back windows...
Actually, the vehicle costs at the end of the account 531 900 Kč.
It's a lot, but try to add to Fabia's extra equipment and you will get a very similar number.
This is why it remains only to choose the mark.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is bad.
The number of children originating from Eastern Europe in British schools is growing, which causes the duration of local education.
The integration of the Europeans is now smooth to a series of obstacles.
The British schools have even found cases where immigrants and descendants of the original inhabitants become violence.
The case of North Kent, where it begins to focus on the sustainable and immigrant opposite conflicts of Slovak's origin, is well illustrated the problem of integration of children originating in Eastern Europe.
The disputes, the Chicany and the bacgarers among students have been translated in relations between parents.
The situation was so far that the police had arrested Chatham a Slovak woman who had killed a rail bar of a 10-year-old student.
The offence was defended by claiming that the boy had denied him by racist reasons.
The police also had to act on the attack against a Slovak immigration conducted by two adolescents.
The young girls had predecefully addressed this man of racistic comments and had thrown down stones.
"When we come to the house, a young man knocked on the bus stop and began to crashed us up.
When I told him to stop, he answered by pumps and thresholds and then discovered his fees," he described another unacceptable adventure of a mother of slovak students.
Requests are formulated by both parties.
One of the delays went to qualify conflicts with the immigrants of overviving immigrants.
The most higher cases show that the atmosphere in the British schools between people of origin and immigrants begins to be held.
70,000 Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And approximately 30,000 Slovak students frequently the British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is really an island of freedom.
Everything you wait for your congés can be realized if you do a good choice.
Beautiful and white beaches like the snow, high vags or then a quiet sea as an etang.
palms and all included with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, glass or good cocktails.
The kitesurfing, the golf and the rocket.
On the Caribbean Islands, you will not find this list only in its integrity, but rich.
But there is only one island you will find more and it's Cuba, the largest and beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
In the Spanish time, Cuba was the foundation of their invasion in America.
Christophe Colomb qualified it as the most beautiful place that human eye has never seen.
HUM became the deposit and the place of the treasures which the Spanish had flighted and transported into Europe.
Then it came to the American air.
The National Hotel was generated at the beginning of the 20th year.
This is Lucky Luciano, one of the chiefs of the American Mafia, who built it, because everything was a crime in the United States (consequently under prohibition) was granted and supported in Cuba: drugs, hatred games, prostitution.
Among his customers, there was, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In HUND, high-level immunities have popped and cars, belonging to cultural symbols in the past 50th century, moved on wide boilards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco of Paula, near the HUM, and, in Cojímar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the business show and political men in the whole America laid their signatures on the walls of the Middle East.
And today?
You can let your autography on the walls of the Bodeguita.
In the National Hotel bar, a luxury hotel, you will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cultural cars are always circulated at the HUM, since the jadies and the jadi imported events have already been in a so-called and humble climate forever.
Although HUM, especially the oldest part, is significantly depressed, no part in the surfaces, there is such a lot of wonderful colonial monuments that there is exactly there.
Other places become better, for example Trinity.
As tourism is so necessary, its development is to green fire.
During the past 15 years, new hotels were not only located in HUM, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguin, as well as on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also proposes an unique fantasy that is in the world and is especially appreciated by the lovers of small trains.
The canine was returned since extended plants in sugars on a straight way by small stairs and motor trains.
Their rublant material has not been renewed for ten years and is so that it can be seen in small places whose contemporary contemporary are not only in museums.
Where do you lead his steps?
Most visitors are not missing the most known places.
Therefore, there is no need to write long on Varader or on HUM.
Unless remember that the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the one who loves this write should not be visited.
The vital Valley in the west of the island is one of the most pittoric coins in Cuba.
An overwhelming vegetation lays down on a calcaire ground.
Moods, calcing ballons and rocks mounting on the foundation of the valley, and, from the fertilizer land standing in their entrances, even its rocks are covered by a very deep vegetable cup.
The Valley is the place where the Cuban tab of the best quality.
You can meet the final form of this product if you visit one of the HUM cigarette factors.
Somebody may also find interesting that there is the Chile Episode of Major Zeman.
Trinity
Old town founded a little time after the Spanish colonised the island.
It is the market of the slavery trade and the sugar who brought him glory and riches.
The riches incarned in the beauty and the city-in-life character of this reduced city.
Colonianí >>yid<<ni architectur, v. u. a.vn. o.vn.nanana pozdjíími francouzkýski, is the same architectur of the architectures, the same is the same as the team of the names of the nimnala.
Trinity, situated between the sea and the Mountains Escambray, is a place at the disappearance in the past 50s of the last century, there was no way that would overcome this region with the rest of the country.
This island allowed him to stay on the side.
Nothing was built, and that's why we weren't disastered anymore, everyone was pleased to have a taste over his head.
If you have, in Trinity, more time than one afternoon, then it needs to go to see also interesting places in the area, such as Playa Anconn and the Valley of Sucreries.
Then, evening, it is delighted to go to the house of the music who is animated after sleeping the sun and where the music is ashamed only at the little morning.
Baracoa
Some designate this bourged situated in the eastern East of Cuba as the most beautiful island.
This opinion is certainly affected by the way that leads to it.
Two roads from Guantánamo must cross high and accidented mountains and pass almost without a mark of human activity.
UNESCO entered the East Cuba Ecu, through its intact landscape, on the list of global heritage.
There is the best chocolate, in the church, there is the croix of Christophe Colomb (in reality, she has seen the day nearly a hundred years after the Colomb penalty) and from the hill where the old chat and the active hotel El Castillo stands, a few mountains, whose most famous is El Yunque.
With regard to the café, the rhum, cigarettes, the Massive Mountains Sierra Master, the Baie of the Striths and the Isle of Pinos, the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of the Holy Sanctuary of Cuba Carity of the Cobre, Santaria, African religions practised by the descendants of the former slaves, on all this could be filled with a number of pages.
Only, as we say just, it's better to see once.
In Afghan, the allegeds are passive, stated by Americans
The lack of soldiers and equipment requires, according to the United States, on the deployment of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, OTAN should require a specific plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afganist was not deployed as it should, but agreed in Edinburgh in Ecosse, representatives of countries with troops in the south of the country.
The eight involved States today also discuss future plans and coordination of alliances today.
While the United States have called this week by the intermediary of the Robert Gates Minister of Defence the OTAN's troops to a greater activity, the Great Britain sees the strengthening of the Afghan government and the intensification of development assistance.
"The evolution in Afghan is in fact sensitive, but the military force can only be a part of the solution.
The other is to allow the people to launch themselves a new development of the economy and security," said the BBC chapter of the British Defence Minister.
Fourty-dix per cent
The activities of Afghan insured are, according to the data of the American Army, the most intensive of these five years.
The number of violent actions has increased from 27 per cent compared to the past year, up to 60 per cent in the Helmand province, located in the south of the country.
OTAN countries have approximately 400,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, which are about one quarter in the south.
However, in accordance with the United States, the allegeds reached their absolute limit and the organization and the equipment of the troops.
Consequently, they demand other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the specific objectives for the coming period, as well as on how to achieve them," said Gates.
The Secretary-General of the OTAN Jaap de Hoop has taken similar proposals today.
"I'm not satisfied about what we have on earth and the air in Afghanistan.
We have at least four and eighteenth percent of the soldiers and the equipment we would need, and that's not enough," said De Hoop to Reuters Agent at the end of talking with the Japanese government in Tokyo that had been three days.
Who is passive
The last months also rule between the countries involved conflicts on the question if all the alleged persons do effectively in Afghanistan as possible.
For example, Germany has been criticised for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively numerous representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimum, therefore, the needs for combating which they are subjects are not so rigorous as those in the South and the East of the country we operate," said Gates.
Sun's British tableid has qualified the German parish soldiers this week.
"The afghans famines discovered: the Germans play, while our people fight", wrote Sun in a comprehensive document by German soldiers' photos playing the table tennis.
The German image magazine has passed to the contra-atak, publicing the photo of a British troop in a rugby game in the south of Afghanistan.
State debt will be reduced to a billion in 2009
The charge of a debt of the State exceeding 84,000 krones in each Czech.
The total debt is estimated at the end of September to 842.7 billion krones.
The Government had planned to immigrate 159,2 milliards of kitchens in this year.
The Ministry has reduced the amount of 152.8 billion kilometres.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic is mounted to the end of September to 842,7 billion corners.
During the nine months of this year, he increased 40.2 billion krones.
But since June, he reduced 13.4 billion krones.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on the debt of the State from the beginning of October.
The charge of a debt exceeding 84.000 krones in each Czech.
During the past year, the State has entered more than 111 billion kitchens.
" For the present time, it appears that, through a less important deficit for the next year, only in 2009 could be transferred to the border of a billion of kitchens.
In the next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a billion of krones," said the Patria Finance David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
The prevision of the next financial analysis of Vladimír Picor's Foundation is similar: "You could overcome a billion in 2009.
The specific date will depend on the next budget that the budget is not yet known.
If he was considered that the political scene situation would change, that policies were ready to improve more, the date could be renewed by 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he explained.
Debts grow
The debt of the State is represented by the debts of the central government and is mainly generated by the accumulation of deficits of the State budget.
The debt of the State is financed by the goods of the treasury, debt titles, direct taxes or, for example, by contracts to the European Investment Bank.
The internal cost of the State has increased this year for $38.5 billion to 719.4 billion.
The external debt of the State has increased this year for the time of 1,7 billion square to 123.3 billion.
The debt of the State called negotiable has reached at the end of September 803,3 billion krones, and from June 13,7 billion kitchens.
The average requirement of the State's debt has increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt has increased internally from the first to the third half of 13 per cent, which is, taking into account the current economic health, too high number.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly generated by the retail titles where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is bad that the debt grows, but on the other side it indicates that there will be material to negotiate when the refund reform will come," Picora data commented.
Better than what it was waiting for.
The State Debt Management Strategy resulted in 2007's planning for 159.2 billion kilometres in this year.
However, at the beginning of September of the month, by an evolution of the State budget's best, the Ministry reduced the sum of 152.8 billion squares.
The sum is mainly represented by the deficit of the State budget, which is clearly reaching 76 billion krones this year, instead of 91.3 billion quarters initially planned.
This is then the maximum sources provided for the Tschech consolidation Agency, such as 13.3 billion krones, the reservation of 10 billion for pension refund, the financing of the status refund for 43 billion squareds and the reimbursement of the European Investment Bank of 1,8 billion.
She had compared today before a court in Khartoum to appoint a peak weapon.
The British teacher who played in the Sudan for the offence of Islam was condemned on Thursday by a court of Khartoum at 15 days of prison and exemption.
The British was convicted to have left students from 6 to 7 years to give the name of Mahomet to a peak weapon, while any representation of the Islam prophet is illegal.
She was unable to be a penalty of pits.
The British Institute of 54 years in the High School Unity of Khartoum in the Sudan was arrested in the Sunday and was inculted by the Islam and Sedition, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanic Criminal Code, following several complaints of students to the Ministry of Sudan's Education.
The relaxing story is actually in the month of September, when this teacher asked his teachers, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the skin eye.
“The names are coming out of the mouth of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 children on 23 have chosen Mohamed as preferred name.
Mohamed is certainly the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially a very common name in the Sudan.
The children then performed a book for the class with the photo of the ears followed by the ready "My name is Mohamed".
The eye itself had no label with that name, but the problem is just the representation of the prophet considered as an insult to the islam.
One of the muscle colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, teaching at the same school in the Sudan, explained that he was well known and that she would never have done anything that could be blaspheming to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked children to vote for a name", it is just a “unjust error”.
Avis shared by many students of the Institute which describes it as “toother attention towards its teachers” and “which never speaks of religion in class”.
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second name in the Great Britain, which is written from English from 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (or given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules relating to the use of this name?
For example, can you give it to a player?
This is certainly a question of interpretation.
They have not arrived in Wednesday to an agreement on the future status of the province, at the last meeting of negotiations in Vienna.
Finally, it's out.
The Serbes and the Albanians of Kosovo have completed Friday in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last discussion meeting, without able to overcome their divergence on the future status of the separate province.
“It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach a status agreement”, said the European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger, at a press conference in Vienna.
In emphasising that peace in the region was “the game”, her American homologge, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to maintain peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
“On does not provide violence in the immediate time but we enter into a very difficult period”, he added, including that "reviewing tensions" exist.
End of mediation on 10 December
Throika mediators, which joins the European Union, the United States and Russia, will take place last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the low-level province to 90% of albanophones could become clearer when Isching, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will reiterate their report to the United Nations Security Council from the 10 December.
Baden debates were the sixth and last session of negotiations since the Troyka was charged by the United Nations in August.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation is completed on 10 December.
The Russians, which have already blocked the Independence Council in Kosovo, stressed them on a pursuant of negotiations beyond this date of good.
"The Russian was and remains engaged in favour of a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral independence declaration?
After eight years of the Ocean Administration of Kosovo, Wests believe that EU independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina said that it was ready to proclaim together if the Security Council does not benefit.
Belgrade insists on an increased autonomy.
“Most often, no agreement was found”, announced the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden hotel, where these “related acts of the last chance” were released since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, the former commander of the cosmovable and future Minister of the province, made part of his complaints.
But he added that the Belgrade Autonomie Plan was “belonging to a past that led to murder and deportation”.
“Effit dominant”
Serbian Boris Tadic said that a compromise was always considerable by maintaining the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of an unilateral declaration of the indipendence of the province.
Belgrade, inter alia, calls for a "herman effect" in a region still fragilyized by the 1990s of independence wars.
“For Serbia, it said, it does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation stressed that any decision should be returned exclusively to the Security Council, where his Russian Alliance had a veto right.
“The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word”
“If a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia”, the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“Their negotiations have been two years.
They must end as they started: to the Security Council.”
For journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had responded that “the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status”, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence of the albanophones would be “in concertation” with the West.
Bush draws a agreement between the Palestinians and the Palestinians
The President George Bush announced, at the opening of the International Peace Conference with its cares in Annapolis, in Maryland, that the Israelites and Palestinians finally agreed on a common declaration.
He stated that the First Minister of Israel Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had been heard to engage immediate negotiations in order to find a definitive regulation of the aged 60 years between their two peoples.
At the presence of the two men, Bush promised that it would do everything to help them to conclude a "paid" right before the end of 2008.
At the same time, the Palestinian infrastructures must end its colonisation activities, Bush said, recalling both parties to their obligations regarding the "related path" for peace which they accepted in 2003.
The Chief of the White House emphasized that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority before Abbas would consider " to conclude a peace treaty solving all the matters in suspension, including central issues".
This calling refers to the heart of the contents between Israel and the Palestinian: the future borders of Palestinian, the status of Jerusalem and the sort of Arab refugees who have been dismissed from their foyers today in the conflict of 1948.
Taking the word after the President of the American, Abbas stressed that the negotiations to come are "globally and extended" and put on all aspects of a Regulation, which includes "Jeruseam, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
In turn to the tribe, Olmert has been forced to be "direct and continuing" and to make "attent to move them in the 2008 current."
Bush fixed the time of implementing its "vidence of two States" Palestinian and Israeli coexistence.
Saudi Arab revealed that she had been engaged in Bush's sense before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a successful success for Washington, is in the origin of a plan set up by all the Arab countries, which proposes Israel ' s peace in exchange of its relief from all Arab territories occupied during the war of 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis mark "a carrefour in the Middle East history, especially because he touches the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," said the Saoud prince in his interview at the Saudi Arabian daily heads.
For the prosecutor, police officers are not responsible.
What happened exactly, Sunday?
As every time in this kind of fact different, official and rulers are obliged.
What are the circumstances of the incident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the National Police Inspection Inspection (IGPN), a police car circulated Sunday, a little after 17 hours, Louise-Michel rue in Villiers-le-Bel.
“He was not in intervention but in patrouille, and circulated to 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare”, explains a police source.
A green moto of the Kawazaki Mark, “not homologized, so it is not allowed to circulate on the public way” (lease below) and piloted by two young without cases, moved “a very alive”.
“It affected the police car on his left, after a priority refusal,” said a policeman.
The control of alcoolemia on vehicle occupators was negative.
The state of the car (fore defounded, as stared, as rayed) shows the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, last morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontise, Mary-Terre de Givry, announced an investigation for “involonary homicide fashes and non-assistance to person in danger” to the IGPN, acting with the Departmental Directorate of Public Safety of Val-d'Oise.
On the afternoon, at the time of a press conference, the prosecutor pointed out that the IGPN investigation at this stage was disabilized by the police.
According to the Judge, three witnesses of the incident, who heard last evening, confirmed “the version of the police, namely that this mini-moto has happened relatively quickly on their left.”
Yesterday, a kind of growing, unfortunately caused by the heat-pied flowing on the ground, showed that the two vehicles have left the time that the police's car comes to broke.
The vehicles have been undertaken and will be subject to technical expertise.

There was nothing to do."
He then saw “a policeman completely hagard, who drunk.
Two others tried to resolve one of the young, the fourth talked on the phone."
In the light of the tension that has quickly been around the scene, and it seems that the persons who had presented the unexpected situation of youth, the police were carried out by colleagues coming on the places.
Ever since this testimony, the helps were "approximately twenty minutes after the police".
They also did cardiac mass, in vain.
“I will not let the police services not help youth.
These young people were helped.
The pumps have arrived soon.
Everything was done to try to save them”, emphasized the prosecutor on its side.

Specific repair on the space station
There will be more than seven hours of work in the space at the Scott Parazynski Astronaute and its camarades of the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular recovery of a deployed sun pane, essential to continue the scientific activities of the station.
A result that has accumulated records from its long time, from its distance from the accommodation modules, from the speed with which it was imagined, the "briculated" tools for rehabilitation.
The problem appeared on Tuesday while the astronautes had laid out the Discovery navigation module, a large cylindrical piece to accommodate the European scientific and Japanese laboratory (see board).
This module is a kind of approximation for laboratory modules.
But we need to approve them in electricity.
The second task of the equipage was therefore to move an electricity production module by solar panels, which defined 17.5 tonnes, already present on the ISS, to put it on its final position.
After wearing it, the equipage turned the relocation of the solar panels of the module that have a 76 meters of 76 metres.
And there's one of the panels, which delined as agreements, has been smoothed around a meter by a cable that has touched.
The deployment has been stopped so that the panel is not more damaged.
Astronautes, which had to originate a check out of the Discovery navigation, then go to repair another sun panel whose the rotation system was defective, were contrary to be devoted to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski that has been selected to go caracoler at the end of the 30 metres long of the telecommunicated shipport added to the station to make rehabilitation.
It's one of the best "spacewalker" (country of space) of Nasa.
Great, staying, very sweet, he has the very developed toast and long arms.
In 46 years, this doctor has therefore been charged to "operate" the sunset panel.
Following exactly inspected disasters, he divided the crime castle and installed kinds of "attal" in the disappeared zone.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" stayed near the saddle and, from the inside, by the other astronautes like Peggy Whitson, the commander of the equipage.
The tool that he had used, a mini-channel of hockey brown of isolation to avoid electrocution on the sunboards produced several hundreds of flights, was designed and "browned" by astronautes on the edge of the station.
Once the operation completed, Scott Parazynski was expected that the panel should be completely expanded before making the inventory of its tools and regaining the station.
Today after midnight, the astronautes benefited from half-day detention before today, seven astronautes don't join the Discovery ship for a return on the planned mercredi.
The EADS title sanctified in Bourse
The EADS action is now netly reduced to Paris's boundary, since the A400M aircraft and defence group announced that it should be exempt between 1,2 and 1,4 billion euros to make face to the late of the A400M.
EADS lost 4% to 21,96 euros at the Paris Bourse.
The group was obliged to reveal its operational outcome for 2007 following the late development of the A400M motor development, which constitutes the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost for delaying the delay taken in the delivery of its military transport airport, announced in October 1,2 and 1,4 billion euros, which were more than 1 billion for Airbus, announced the mother house of the European EADS constructor.
In response to these charges, EADS will be bound to announce new operational results (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its next trimth outcomes, if there is no more chiffred specifications.
The group also indicates that the estimation of new charges is coherent with the period of six months.
For recall, the operational result of EADS was 86% in 2006, mostly due to charges related to a further programme, the very large A380 port.
The Group initially presented a first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The selection of the status where
There will be no suspension on Sunday, on the towns: Russians will have to oppose massively for the party of President Poutine, Russia.
Confirming their aspiration to stability, even in the autoritatorism, after a very strict campaign.
Three days of the legislative elections, the Russian President Vladimir Poutine address to the elections today, a televised message on public chains, already registered, but the content is secret.
It makes it as a head of Russian list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is exposing.
Today, the Chairman left nothing to transpare by receiving foreign ambassadors, pleased to give a new charge against the Introductor of Ingress - its theme of prevention during the campaign.
"We know the price of a real democracy and we want to be honorable, transparency and the most open, elections without accroches," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we're far from the account.
It offers a pressing campaign.
The communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov said that there were no "here had also selled elections, even at the time of Eltsine".
After the repression of the events of the last weekend, the former campaign of the world of echos Garry Kasparov, condemned to five days of prison for illegal demonstration, remains prohibited by his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of soviety"
After these unpaid legislation, two more open questions are profiled:
- Who will succeed in Poutine at the presidency?
The Official Journal published the date of the first tour of the President, on 2 March 2008; candidates have until 23 December to meet themselves.
In 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Poutine can not translate a third consequent mandate.
But there's no successor.
- What will Poutine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chief of the parliamentary majority and of all the powerful Russian party that would choose the government and the President?
Whatever it is, the laws such as the President, the power of triomphera.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of the soviety Homo, they don't feel masters of their destiny," said Lev Goudkov, independent centre director.
The Historium Nikolai Kopossov, of the University of Saint-Petersburg, far far away: the civil society has taken away in this Christianized country five century after Europe; the Community’s hungry spirit retained the training of individualism.
After the Liberal Reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine has renewed the model of a paternal State, perfectly accepted by the population as far as this new paternalism has not been followed by the earthquake, but by a certain economic aisance," believes Mary Lipman, the Carnegy Fundation.
Today, the Russians “acknowledged to the personal responsibilities” which they had briefly proved after the appointment of the URSS.
"What good to think?"
The phenomenon affects all social couches, including the world of business.
And the administrative election intends to keep the status quo: 65 governance (on 85 Russian heads) leading the local lists of Russian.
New Freedoms imported from West are often chaos synonyms, such as in the 1990s.
The opinion prevents stability.
On behalf of what the Russians will no longer vote for the extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, professor of 54 years: “What is good to think?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why do they change them? ”
A hard memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the national archives of Bad Arolsen, which retain the destinations of 17.5 million of the Hitler regime, are free.
The 47 million archive documents, covered by 27 km from lines to Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were only available in a “ humanitarian purpose”, which is individually and nominative, on the request of an old victim or his right.
The eleven states in support of their management, by Germany, France, Israel and the United States have agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and stories.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, opening is effective since yesterday.
Sensible information
The access of the stories in Bad Arolsen will provide research “in particular on the movement of prisoners, the population of the forced workers and the status of the health of the workers”, the Ne Ministrian director of those archives managered by the International Cross-Rouge Committee (CICR).
To recently, several States, including Germany, were opposed to open the public of these nominative documents, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like homosexuality or mental disabilities of some victims of deportation.
The registers of the concentration camps or arrest mandates established by the Gestapo were gathered after war in a practical goal: recover the civilians deported or subjected to the obligation work and may provide them a evidence of their internal way to open their compensation.
Another time in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are treated with ten thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is limited interest.
"There is not a new thing to wait for these documents," said Mr. Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Anthemymist University of Berlin, 2006.

Montreal compare the Terminator
It's not easy to remove hollywoodian movies in Montreal when nobody else than Terminator opposes...
This section mission is part of the functions of delegate.
A “politically difficult” mandate because the governor of California, Arnold Blackeneger, denotes the “runaway productions”.
Is it difficult to play in the contracts of the Governator?
"The industry must be careful, is that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she's going.
Our role is to offer them to judge the best."
The course for festivals
However, the priority of Denis Turcotte is the promotion of this cinem.
The course to Oscars is started.
It will be all festivals of the West Coast, that is Sundance, Denver, Seattle, or San Francisco, to submit the Cuban films, to make them value, and to ensure that the realistors make an interview.
The Age of darkness had a beautiful winter at 30. Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented to Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the display of Santa Monica and will be presented on November 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
The Quebec also presented four long and four short meters to the American Film Institute Feste this month.
Will it be a end of year? The experts divided by the sub-prise crisis.
At least five weeks from the closure of the biennium, investors are already flowing hands by waiting for the arrival of the ransom final year.
However, the experts are not also some that will happen in this year.
Banif believes that "the statistical point of view is generally a positive behaviour.
However, it should not be made exclusively based on statistics, since, given the current context, uncertainties govern on markets at least in short term " .
Although they are not partakers to invest the bottle in the last weeks of the year, these experts notes that "the boiling market is noted through the existence of liquidity, which is intended to invest the lack of alternatives with guarantees, particularly the fixed income, affected by the effect of escape to quality values as well as in long periods and in short years".
For this reason, they believe that the borse will be a rather bilateral behaviour, not exclusive of oliveties "for they do not know the likely impact of the ratio of the Fed, given the high level of the brutal and the danger of stimulation of inflationistic tensions"
Javier Barrio, responsible for BPI sales in Spain, is agreed on the fact that it is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"It's not the best thing," assure the expert.
Ibex, Spanish bus indicator, lost about 4% since 8 November when the index was closed at 15.945.7 points.
However, not all experts have this vision so negative.
John Solana, analyzing of Intermoney, believed that Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points through the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to the pension regimes each year.
However, the expert notes that things will be a little different this year because he believes that the rallye will happen from the second week of December, after the feast of the Constitution (6 December).
The analysis does not consider that birdity would affect market tendencies.
For its part, On Once Olucha, an analysis of Bankco, assess that we are close to the technical levels and "for this reason we could observe the increase in the index that could be provoked according to the information from the European Union concerning the consequences of the crisis on the credit market."
The analyst hopes that those will be positive.
The analysis are agreed to choose the values that will be responsible for conducting Ibex to new maximum cottons.
Solana, from Intermoney, states that "the great values this year are returning to him."
The expert would include the two large banks and some constructors "for example, when the date is close, the electric sector will be very nice."
As soon as Olucha, bank investments ensure that increases will be from the bank and industrial sector.
The constructors may also benefit from this rally, in the case they are placed there.
"ACS for several months recovery positions and we hope that the other constructors like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same way," explains the expert.
The cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase of sales in the Noël sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technological enterprises will be very well, although in this case there is no much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only in two occasions in December was a month of bathroom.
In 2003, the authentic end rally had been held in 2003, during which the busers markets were out of the crisis caused by the loss of the technological bulletin.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the month of December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
It should be seen if 2007 is the fifth year pursuant to wins (for the time Ibex has increased from 8,36% since January) and if it has succeeded on the end of the year.
The Popular Bank will open 200 offices open on Monday on Saturday
The Popular Bank decided to resume a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These successors, which will operate under the Max Popular Mark, represent a large change for the bank.
So for the rest of Spanish organizations, as it is the first group decided to start shared on the opening of its agencies until 20:30, and to open on Saturday from 10:30 to 20:30.
Another group who also reiterated several times that it would like to facilitate the hours of his successors, BBVA, even if it has not yet decided to do the first step.
It is on the point to conclude agreement with the unions to close 75 per cent of its agency on Saturday instead of opening a afternoon, but not the public.
The results of the experience of the Popular Bank will be decided to add other organizations or not to this initiative that cooperates in trade times.
This is precisely the goal that seeks the Popular Bank.
Take self-employed customers in these areas to make their purchases in the SMEs and the road trades selected to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies that are planned throughout Spain for about 18 months, as it is not the opening of new agencies but a renewment of the existing.
This is why the body will modernize the successors already in the commercial areas, adapting them to the client profile in the different streets.
In this way, the acceleration of the hours is accompanied by a different concept of the successoral and a new design, more current, with lighter colours.
The bank license, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renewation does not impose large investments, but that staff building, because the employee number will increase from six to eight or nine by agency.
Agency, which will also have spaces to ensure that PMs can be gathered, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Popular Bank has already tested its initiative in three agencies of Madrid.
And experience was positive, as explains the Rivero.
Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and the Great Vía in Madrid are the roads to have been selected, and apparently, according to Rivero.
The Popular Bank is currently 2 500 succursors.
And 60 others operated under the sign of Monocredit, specialized in the immigrants case, also with very close hours, which even open the Sunday and the feast days.
In these offices of PopularMax, they will not copy the BBVA model, where many of its agencies have a large number of non-financial products for their sale.
'We don't want to make competition with our customers', noted Rivero.
At this time, they arrived in an agreement with Telephone to sell mobile phones, with an external staff to the bank.
Double television for the first time the value in Bourse of his Antenal rival 3
We're here.
With this sentence Paul Vasil, a Delegate Adviser of Telecinco, expressed its pleasure at the closure of the market, when he found that the chain that he leaded the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One unique aspect was rejoicing her joy: 'What makes me bad,' is not the fact that we have grown more but we have less damaged', said he.
However, he has focused on the fact that on a low market, 'We have less kicked'.
The telecommunication has completed today with a progress of 2.54%.
This gain sets its loss to 15,66% for a year.
The value in Bourse of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% in more) has reached 4.488.88 million euros according to Blomberg data.
His previous rise 3, which was lowered here at 1,52% and which raises a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of other communication undertakings in Bourse is 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million in the Prisa (Cinco Días Editor) and 1.779 million in Vocent.
According to Vasil, the comparison with Genen 3 is that we are talking about two similar enterprises.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do on the same market to what price and how we benefit it in terms of audience. "
Televice announced the last week that he was intended to become the first television chain to overcome over 1,000 million gross public incomes, as provided by Joseph Tringali, the Delegate Adviser of Telecinco and Publispa, the filial who manages the publicity of the group.
In order to ensure that this announced data is real, the television chain should register an increase in 3,6 per cent for publicity than 965.4 million for the 2006 biennium.
For its part, the net factory of Antenne 3 increased from 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the biennium (to reach 734.4 million) while net income of television increased from 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors pointed out for the best Telecinco-related development in Bourse is the important payment that he has maintained until now: in 2006, Alejandro Echevaria's company has distributed 100 per cent of the benefit between its assets.
Although it is early to take a decision, this ratio could vary after the acquisition of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
'We have the official compromise to give for minimum 50 per cent, although we've always said much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make contents of our shareholders, to those who have already given us titles with Endemol's 33%.
The market is now given to fatigue signs.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced the benefits of telecommunication benefits in 2008 to 4 per cent and 7 per cent in 2009.
This should be explained to the decrease of the growth of 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and 5,5 per cent to 5,1 per cent in 2009.
The same company reduced the prevision of the gains in Antene 3 to 4,5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009.

Good agrees to be at the candidature of the Spanish Socialist Party for Tolède and to presiding the Congress if they gain the elections
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapather, to be the list of the Spanish socialist party for Tolède for the next general elections and to be President of the Congress in the case where socialists will win general elections.
The secretariat of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono even announced it during a press conference after the meeting that middle at the Federal Chamber of the Party with Zapatter.
The Chief of the Executive justified the offer made to the ex-ministrial because "the matter is important to account the best" in political and Bono " is among the best."
Furthermore, he emphasized that "the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group who will consider the Congress if socialists will gain the next elections.
It would be good to replace Manuel Marin as President of the Congress, which has made public on 15 November last its decision to not present the next general elections and to leave its political carrier to dedicate the fight against climate change in the university.
The former ministry recognized that the President of the Government had not decided to resolve to return to the political form since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he noted that, even though citizens already know that he would be the Economic Chairman if the Spanish Socialist Party gains the elections, his party wished to announce the Congress presidency in a " Transparency Act".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to transform the Chamber in " a house of respect and not of insulin or cry" and to make it more like the citizens.
"After it seems unfortunately that the only local of Madrid where you can't speak quiet and quietly is the Congress, the President of the Government in Senat has been interrupted 26 times."
Likewise, he had words for his current President, Manuel Marin and "see to do" and he didn't want to do as if he was already occupied to not fall, as he noticed it, in which his adversaries might consider "related domination."
A climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to a persecution without miserable as well as the sceptics of its preventions and those that give priority to other political and social battlees, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
It is now more the case for a leader of the movement, who is President of the Government as Zapather and who believes that this fight is more important than the Islamist terrorist and that is even proposed to sign a “new contract for the planet”.
This approach allows to explain why the action or in action of its Government has contributed in a decisive way to Spain's heading of the European Union in the Kyoto Protocols.
Who are responsible for non-exécution, in which sectors it has been produced and why his Government, the contract with the planet, did not avoid it.
Furthermore, it must clearly explain the Spanish what the measures it will take to remove climate change.
What undertakings will be affected, what standards of citizens will be changed, which individual and collective energy economies will be obliged to us to do, what economic consequences this will cause.
That's what he's gonna be sacred and paid to save the planet.
But there was no explications.
Precisely because it is a sacred and payment.
The climate change measures, real measures, are impulsive.
Inconsistent, inconsistent and misconsistent for business accounts and individuals.
Until the centuries of the suggess suggested by the Spanish socialist party, he leaving him as dangerous in Zapather that he was explored from the nick.
It is to say that it is to save the planet with nothing, only with the propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
Considers that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this lord is so useful for electoral campaigns that do not speak, which does not deniate and that does not require, embraces the meetings and inspires tennis.
Although this is only limited to be a pure virtually contractoral part which does not provide us to displace bicyclette or we are refreshing with the event.

This is what the feelings generating the monthly payment of workers depends on what the colleagues gain.
The study was carried out by magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the last number of Science.
Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the neuro-recognizing group's Institute Life–Brain, in Germany: "The strongest activity occurred when the participant had responded correctly and his fellow worked."

The Balkan Prosecutor
For eight years, Carla del Pontulus continued implicitly by the Balkan war crimes from the Public Ministry of the Federal Court for the former Yugoslavia, which is located in the Hague.
His mandate ends at the end of the year, and Carla will go with a goud, because the main responsible for the murder of Srebrenica, in which 8,000 bosnian musulmans are dead, the former General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbosnio Radovan Karadzic, are still free.
Their names are in this list whose documentary by the Swiss realistor Marcel Schüpbach is titled, " the Carla " (2006), which is not designed exclusively in Spain, with the rehydrom of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss Prosecutor in New York who continues to flew criminals and express pressure on the Governments involved to resurrect the course.
What's the assurance to me?
The car insurance, which covers the conductor faces sympathetic events, implies an important cost that will depend on different factors, such as age, sex, oldness of the license, civil state, vehicle types to ensure or use, among others.
See a car is the main.
And it is that selecting the appropriate car insurance is even more difficult than selecting the vehicle model.
And it is that, selecting the appropriate car insurance, is even more difficult than selecting the vehicle model.
Car insurance is an agreement between a insurance company and the insurance company.
This compromise is materialised by a insurance contract, which establishs that the company receives the value of the first granted and in exchange is responsible for paying the immune in case of sinister.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is based in account of different factors, such as age, sex, oldness of the license to lead, civil state, vehicle type to ensure or use, among others.
The insurance companys establish their prices according to statistics, so that more likely to submit a accident is higher, more the cotton to verse is high.
That is why people over 25 years and women must pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these persons have a lower rate of synthesis than their complaint.
In the same way, in the use of recensements, companys concluded that married persons have less accidents than celibatary conductors.
The use of the vehicle will affect frequency, and therefore the probability of having an accident.
Increasing frequency, probability increases.
They are many of the variables that the insuranceers take into account when the price of the press is set.
This is why the conductor must examine the situation in order to choose the car insurance that is better adapted to its profile.
The most significant variables are here to choose one or the other type of insurance, so that, in addition to adapting the characteristics of the survey, it offers a reasonable price.
Young age of 25 must face different inconvenents at the time of transiting a contract with an accessible price, as may be the low experience in the conduct and the ancientness of the delivery permit.
Although the ideal to be well assured is to ensure any risk, other economic options exist.
The most predicting drivers can opt for an entire risk with franchise, so that they get coverages of an insurance at any risk but to a more accessible price.
This convention form implies that the customer pays a part of the amount of the sinister.
"The part of the left amount that the verse client will be established in accordance with the value of the first, which will be higher than the amount will be low", specific Luis Noguera, the responsible in Spain of First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is the extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to face third-party damage, but by those caused on their own car.
Furthermore, it would be covered against flight, fires and loss of the vehicle.
A advice.
If you're less than 25 years try to be careful and to avoid synthesis in the measure possible, since this will be repercussioned on the goodness, to reduce the price of insurance to the future.
A goodness is a reduction of the base tariff that holds the company.
In contrast, a sanction is a majority of the basic tariff.
"Light and sanctions will depend on the company and the benefit of that.
If the company had a good year, it may allow you to increase the goods," explain Noguera.
In addition to 25 years, it becomes easier for conductors at the time of transiting a contract with a insurance, since the rate of synthesis is reduced through accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is preferable to choose an insurance all risk with French.
"Otherwise young people cannot benefit from the pre-acquired experience after an accident," assure the director of the European company in Spain and adds that most accidents have occurred during the second year of conduct, once the fear of the newsletter.
However, if the customer is married but still has no children, it is preferable to negotiate an insurance at all risks when its economic situation allows it.
The marriage with children is considered by the survivors as persons with the lowest rate of synthesis, because majorities will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be a risk with a franchise (he may be 300 euros), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of the vehicle's life when the insurance has a high level of goodness.
"They have a more decontracted behaviour and they have a greater purchase power to allow the luxury to assess a more important amount of French", judge Luis Noguera.
For pensions, any risk insurance with France is preferable (e.g. 150 euros), or an extended third-party insurance when the security has a high level of goodness.
It is necessary to say that the car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the conductor faces sinusal events, but also because it represents an important expenditure, it is therefore essential to consider the insurance that is most important to us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will seek to win a point in Milan to reach the eight of the end
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow are measured on Tuesday next to San Siro in the search for the point that they are lacking to achieve their respective objectives in the closure of the Champions link, as it serves Italians to be first and to classify.
The Italians totalize ten points and have already been qualified during the fifth day, thanks to a single game in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to ensure that the Shakhtar Donetsk has six, who receives Benfica who has four, does not go before him.
The two matches of the Group D will play a week before the sixth day end, since the AC Milan has to discover the end of the World Couple of Clubs in Japan on 13 of this month in the search for a place for the end of 16 December.
So, this group will remain closed before the match just at the stage José Meazza seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams tried to exit victorious, because Italians wouldn't want to speculate at home and the Celtic Glasgow knows that it would be the first and would be a better growing in the eightth ends.
A defect of the Gordon Strachan team could be sufficient to classify if Shakhtar Donetsk won't win, but it can't only win computer on that because with nine points the game returns to the Ukraine, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who gained (2-0) in the other direct second.
Thus, the thousands tried to impose the evening of the ecosis, who hoped to classify for the eighth end for the second time at the League Champions, after being killed during the last edition by a Kaka goal during the lengths (1-0).
At the same time, the triumph would be returned to Shakhtar, where Celtic was lost, to classify for eight ends to continue the EUFA campaigns.
And it is that the Benefit, although it is last and without opportunity to continue the European competition, could reach the third place with a victory.

I was nervous, but I saw the feelings of people changed, the feelings for the Girls Spice has changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad to have taken a decision" said Chisholm about the group meeting that she had disappeared nine years ago.

They will be in Madrid on 23 December.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine throws the alarm.
A dispute on the price of feast gas between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risks of impact on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (U.E.) are sent by gases, and each conduct is closely monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the fuel cost, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
In the last year, a change between the two had caused a reduction of the provisions to the U.S. countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow was after the Ukrainian Government and Gazprom, the Russian property monopol society, providing gas, had been vainly tried to find an agreement on the Russian gas costs provided to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase as intended, as the Ukrainian price was accepted to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the delivery of the neighbourhood of Turkmenistan.
The analysis stated that it would be for Ukraine, an increase in 40% of the import costs from Gazprom.
“It is essential to use all our arguments during conversation, remembering that we are a country through which the majority of the gas passes,” said the Ukrainian Minister of Economic, Anatoly Kinkh at the Reuters Press Agency.
“Groat cost fluctuations would be unfortunately linked to our discussions about transit taxes (for Western Europe) through Ukraine”
The latest change between Moscow and Kiev was in January 2006, the interruption of Gazprom providers intended to Ukraine.
This resulted in the cost of exports to West Europe, increased prices.
The Russian gas represents a quarter of the provisions of the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, even though most of them are still developed.
Therefore, Gazprom is full of its own provisions with a gas from Turkmenistan and other countries of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health for Foreign Employers.
The Ministry of Ecosa Health must improve monitoring on its additional Community employees to verify whether they have previous penalties, the Monitoring Committee said.
The warning of the General Review, Robert Black, has occurred after a foreign doctor working in Ecosse, was involved in the attack at the Glasgow airport of June.
Mr. Black also expressed its concern on the fact that the Ministry of Economic Health does not have specific data on the number of employed persons.
Its report has also made other decision-making controls, correctly carried out on a sample of five health authorities.
The General Reviewer made controls on the EU extra staff following the attack of Glasgow airport.
Bilal Adullah, 28 years old, is a doctor of origin to the Royal Alexandra de Paisley hospital. It was arrested at the airport after he broke with his jeep, in the main terminal doors.
He went out of the three doctors who were filmed in Old Bailey in October, as suspected of being involved in several car explosives in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health should carry out pre-employment controls on the super-employment staff in order to be some of the validity of their qualifications, experiences and work permit for the United Kingdom.
Although the Ministry of Ecossas Health uses the Disclosure to carry out the controls of previous criminals, the Agency has no right to get such information outside the Great Britain.
Among many warnings, the report of the General Reviewer now states that the committees have to be compared with the Office of Criminal Control, which allows employees to undertake controls on various countries.
“Although we found that some information about staff have been well checked, it is not every time.”
Mr. Black said that the Ministry of Ecos Health effectives most of the employment controls itself, but he also added: “The report enhances the aspects in which the system can be improved in order to ensure that appropriate information on some members of the oar-mer staff will be available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Ecosse, said that it was "extrêmely unrealisable" that employment controls could identify employees who could make the future terrorist acts.
"The report suggests that the current employment controls are well operating in the ecosystem and that these warnings could not be added."
The eco-sized health authorities said to employ 1161 persons for most doctors and sisters.
But the Reviewer said that these figures must certainly be increased, in part because of the problems relating to the identification of staff members of undetermined contract, which could choose or not to stay in our country.
The investigation showed that the current procedures for health controls in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are fully accurate.
These controls are carried out on passport, work permits and qualifications.
The Economic Government is currently revised its policy and its system of employment pre-use controls for other ocean staff officers.
The secretariat to the Nikola Sturgeon Health said: "I was enthusiastic to realize this work following the terrorist attack at the Glasgow airport."
She added that the Ecosa Government attached to health committees would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report which should be published the next month, and would be engaged in ensuring better implementation of the actually updated and valid for all employees, including employees.

Military, encouraged by the calls launched against the Saudi Government for West, by Osama Bin Laden, Leader of Al Qaeda of Saoudite origin, targeted foreign residence, government's immunities and energy supply sites.
In the past five months, important efforts were made by armed forces have been made in the last “the word of the Minister of Interior at the State Television”.
Among those detainees, 16 members of the Medinan organised in a "mediatic cell" to promote "the tafiri thought", the idea of musulman roots Sunni which supports the use of violence against infidel musulmans.
Among the detainees, 32 persons are accused of subvention of warrants.
Vénus climate could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said that Vénus was certainly a pleasant planet to live.
The data of the European orbital vessel in data shown that the planet is certainly twice smaller than the Earth, in contrast to what it was thought before.
Vénus is the most nearest planet of the Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Vénus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that thousands of years ago, Venus might have similar conditions as those of the earth, and could even have been living.
But the smooth effect had to carbon dioxyde, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiations joined to a slower rotation had Vénus leaded to every other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is private water, it is ravaged by niagans and light temperatures and has enough hot temperature surface to foster the plot.
The discovery of Venus Express, the sond of the European Space Agency, who studied the planet for one year, offers a triste vision of the potential future of the Earth to the Climate Changes.
The professor of the physical department of the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We begin to understand the reason why the Vénus climate is so different than the earth, although the planets even are practically similar.
"Our new data allow us to establish a scenario that has been milliards of years, Vénus would be originally identical to the earth, even with a living surface."
The police's enricher uranium.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently of the uranium, was sequenced by the Czechoslovac and Hungarian police yesterday.
A policeman said that three persons were arrested and that the material is currently analyzed.
It did not confirm that it was a good urnium, but she revealed that the goods would have a $1 million ($480,000).
Another open to everything
Mitt Romney said not to be high as a candidate in the Presidency to answer questions of a good snow man.
Despite this, the Republician candidates at the Presidency finally agreed to participate in the discussion of Youtube, during which many ordinary elections registered their questions are subject to candidates.
Friday night 28 November, no of the questions raised was so ridiculous as the issue of another debate of You Tube, when a good snow man asked to democrats their position with regard to the disappearance of the planet.
But this time the questions and responses have been very reflected in the conditions of the Republic's Party, candidate to the next elections.
CNN producers who sponsored the debate have chosen you Tube's clips to show candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest of one subject, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the subjects of the forces for the Republics.
CNN requested some telephone elections when they hearing pleasing things: The Regiment has made approximate increases when candidates expressed greatly.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is heading of the important prior elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to resolve the fact that he was accompanied by the Caribbean immigration during its Master Managing in New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former manager of Massachusetts, to employ the Caribbean immigrants at home.
The two fighters became particularly female when they asked whether they would be ready to promote an 'amnesia' (as providing a regular status and the possibility of become citizens).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congress, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congress, has been able to expand this subject.
No one has the opportunity to be chosen, but the two remain in the course may be grateful because they have started fighting immigration before and more intensively than others.
In general, the candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same views: the highest borders and the green tolerance for the Caribbean immigrants.
This subject, with regard to concerns stressed, in particular by the case of produced toxic players in China, or by other fears against the external world, encourage the Republics to forget, or to minimize the divisions between liberty and Catholic conservators.
But the debate has become particularly amazing when other subjects have been raised.
Mr. Giuuliani asked why he had first supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water should be put into the nest as a torture.
One of the attendants asked whether the candidates believed in all of the Bible’s contents.
This led Mr. Giuliani to say that the Bible is his favorite book, even if he is not to believe in the history of Jonas and the Whale.
Another attendant asked whether Jesus would be for the death penalty.
It was not expected to see Mike Huckabee, - in pool position in Iowa in recent election, because of his long-term Christian conservation - to declare that death penalty is painful as well as needed.
When we were stressed to know if Jesus had been favourable, he laughed and said that Jesus was too clothing to present the elections.
Human race remains insatisfactoryly open.
Mr. Huckabee's remontation in Iowa coincided with the recent wonderful research of subventions carried out by liberary Ron Paul, and the symptoms during the mercredi debate.
These two are emerging, because the two protected parties are not able to agree to decide who is the most known and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a single candidate is the good time party and convaincing through a success message on the U.S.'G.'G.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from being clear.
The duty of the Working Lists
Gordon Brown discovered a new goal in which shadow; even if he was released, the situation wouldn't change.
In view of the tendance of British scandales, this is not particularly judging.
No decorations sold, nor parish hotel facts of politics, no extra conjugal foot.
But this is that an expected revealing that a rich man of business would have made for four years, under false names, its contributions to the current Working Party, equivalents to more than $650,000 ($1.3m), which the party would not have declared: a new battle of which Gordon Brown had been well done.
Two months ago, the first minister walked back in his election project, stubbornly denialing the British intelligence that the opinion songs did not affect its decision, and that he hoped at the contrast, offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such Vince Cable, the libro-democratic leader said that the terrorist Brown has transformed from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The Northern Rock rachat, a bank in difficultship at the boat of the crack, demonstrated a fatal of directives and a mediator judge in the case of emergency.
Inadequate proposals for the change of the tax code have caused coalition of industrial groups against the Government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from the tax authorities showed an incredible administrative burden.
A trion of generals at the pension has launched a revolution between the Lords, protesting against the reduction of military expenditures: they declared that being a defence minister for them is part-time employment.
At the present time, the suspicion of lovers from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Secretary-General of the Working Lists (and his former Master of Watt) did that they had to be released.
Nothing of this means that Mr. Brown leads unmaniably to the exit.
However, governments may come to a point where it would be impossible to rule.
People don't love politicians, and they do not trust in them, but generally leave their doubts of cott when a new government comes to the power.
It seems obvious that a first minister could not improve the things, nor even govern for a long time, while it risks the suspension: the public administration does not work; the Minister's officers are balanced; the pressure of the bad stories; and the government must become on defense and without any objective.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because in contrast to other political leaders, it cannot be a starter.
Although he wanted to repair Tony Blair, he was his highest placer.
The problems relating to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr Brown's decisions when he was a chance of the British treasurer.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blair’s badness, such as the long investigation on the funds of the Party 'for the money which is for the Lords Chamber', the elections could think the contrary.
But the difficult situation that is about Mr Brown is not so tragic that it is in the air.
The diagrams are not so monstrually as members of the Tories Party believe it.
As in Mr. Bean, there's no victim or scratch.
And the remembrance, although painful, could be the conceal of Mr Brown's steel trends for ever, for a reliable and loud government.
The new scandal on political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special person who compares his gifts to love, said he would not wish any public recognition of his well-being.
He may have his opinion, but it is not him to decide.
The laws against the immunity of large politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: the public has the right to know what contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who stated to be in line with Mr. Abrahams' programmes, without knowing that it was unlawful, should therefore be questioned, as Jon Mendlesohn, the manager of the subsidiary collections that had spoken of suspect donations in October.
But to this, Mr Brown is not involved: Nothing lets think that it has been at the time of these developments, even though most payments had been made after its arrival to the Government in June.
Until here, the first ministry made half.
He quickly condemned the legislative fault of its party, but he did not take attention to the fact that the decision authority was decided on a good thing he knows, to use a investigation committee on the subject of a prosecutor to the pension and a judge.
In that case, the teaching teachers are not complied.
And if the law was shot, it is the police's office.
Furthermore, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as a permanent President for the independent Committee of Public Life Standards, without leadership for six months, and prepare a good reform on the financing of political parties.
This would oblige the Working Party at a moment of weakness to cooperate with the Tories, which could lead to resolve its particular financial report with confidence; in a short time, an amigant pillar for a party such as Mr. Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservatory Party now has a good benefit for the elections; he has two years to recognize the elections, and the only way to obtain a victory is to demonstrate an irreproprived integrity and solid skills.
Card screens.
Will the crisis contain the US credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it's normal to see attacked nervous, to turn around.
Now that the American property market is through a critical phase, the predecessors are in the US market of credit cards.
Goldman Sachs' analysis believe that credit card loss could reach $99 billion if the condensation extends any other forms of credit to the consumer.
Tension signs are clearly visible.
There are increases in costs and insolvency rates, which measures the parts of the non-recurrent balance or which are, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced the last month that he took $1,4 billion in its consumer credits, partly because of the weakness of card ports.
He's still too early to panic.
The costs and insolvency are still moderated.
According to Moody, a fiscal agency, the insolvency rate of 3,89% of the third quarter is nearly less than one point compared to its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change of laws in 2005 to the United States, with regard to the personal bankroat, caused a decrease of bankroute archives, which, at its tour, caused losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and therefore insolvency rates) could even increase if the implant conditions had to be initiated.
In addition, the industry announces fixed payment rates, which reduce the monthly payment sum that consumers must regulate.
and confidence in the security of the credit card capital is sufficiently strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of the structured finance.
Dennis Moroney de TowerGroup, a research society, predicted that the emission volume for 2007 will be 25% above last year.
The direct infection links between the hypothetics crisis and the credit card market are certainly: consumers could prefer to increase their ends now that the fair real estate imponents have disappeared.
But card emisors are more attention to the species flow than the value of the owner, and so the prices of the immobility has not made a change in the credibility of immigrants.
They could even benefit to credit title emitteners.
The prices to consumers for the payment of hypothecs are to say if properties cost less than the value of the immune; therefore, credit card should be a priority to repay all.
Card emisors are able to respond more faster than hypothecs and more flexibility to such crises because they can change interest rates or increase credit limits.
This should reduce the risk of rapid recovery of actions.
“We will not wake up at a morning and revaluate all the impressions” said Gary Perlin, Captain One.
If a financial catastrophe of the credit card market is impossible, there are strong risks to have an appropriate decline.
If the lower prices of immobility and contraction in the credit market bringing America to the recession, the industry must certainly face Macao future.
Take care of the dorsal nageoires.
The British banners are offended for Enron's case.
The three British bankers who should go to demonstrate their roles in respect of a fraude committed by the previous financial director of Enron, Mr. Andrew Fastow, have changed their statement by paying injuries.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were first unlawful statements of the seven complaints for presumed fross in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial screen to enrich the debt of their employees.
They should be presented to the court in January.
But during an audience presided by the American Judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they were all accused of having committed fraude.
The three ex frameworks of Greenwich NatWest, a PLC group of the Royale Bank of Escosse, became known everywhere in Britain because of extradition procedures for two years.
In the United States, their cases still remain a suspensive question for this investigation launched following the crime of Enron in 2001.
The accused in 2002 undertaken to Fastow that he was the government's investigation in the Enron decade.
The accuses against bankers, named "Thirs of Natwest" claims to be come to Houston in 2000, to organize a huge scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a filia of an Enron's partner controlled by Fastow, who was the meter in scene of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him to conduct bankroute procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest for the filial as no, but the three Britishs already know their value.
A company controlled by Kopper has bought the interest of the filial bank for $1 million.
The bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as interest for this company.
According to the accused, Fastow would fairly announce Enron that energy society was intended to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its actions in the filial.
But actually these $20 million have gone into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the accused, bankers would have obtained $7,3 while Fastow, Kopper and others would have gained $12,3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow was offended for its active role in two conspirations in the Enron deployment.
The British three was arrested three months later.
Incarceration of six years in a federal prison in Louisian.
Kopper is incarnated for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three Britishs have been released after payment of $1 million, which are obliged to live in the United States during the process.
Enron, before the seventh larger national society, in the bankroat in December 2001 after accountable truck years, could no longer hide its Millenniums of exchange or even propose their bidon specifications as rentable.
The foundation caused thousands of licensees, more than $60 billion loss of market value and more than $2 billion loss for pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the former President Jeffrey Skilling were condemned in the last year, for their implication in the foundation of society.
Skilling was condemned to more than 24 years of prison.
The accuses against Lay for conspiration, fraude and other crimes have been disastrous because of his death, a heart crises in the past year.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce motor and has sufficient fuel autonomy for Moscow without escape to Los Angeles, a part of $54 million.
But this is just a small change for some Russians.
"He can transport up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"More if no person really needs seats to see that it is more than a family use aircraft or for the President of a society."
Mr. Firer was present at the state of Gulfstream, last Friday, at the Millenniums Hall, a consumer orange for four days, which stands in a huge capital exhibition center.
Outside Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hopeing to sustain the interest of the new Russian rich for their different products, walking in acid-up to diamants cars like those of 50 cent.
Mr. Firer scrutined a brillant porch, expressed by his stand.
"It's a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product," said he.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest private airport market.”
"Increased to a petrol boom, the Russian capital seems to wrap in black gold, such as Dallas"
“We have lived the same thing in the years 1890, when some Americans have become so rich and have been debarated in Europe where they were considered as materialists”, said Marshall Goldman, an older euditor of the Departement of Russian and Eurasian studies at the Harvard University.”
As Saudians in the 70s, Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the greatest global costs.
The largest luxury marks are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, at another place in Moscow, a luxury industry conference allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, President of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for market goods, such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to society The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billion $282 billion, according to the list of Forbes that number the most rich people.
Furthermore, two thirds of the riches are composed of $670 billion globally, according to a study on the evolution of personal riches in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economic and financial research centre.
(The World Bank stated that 15.8% of Russians lived under poverty soil in 2005).
“There are hundreds of millions of people in Moscow, so we are all here” said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, London's lounger.
She participated in the Salon for the first time in the Russian Distributor, The Soho Group.
“ Women are all good prepared and men are strong. ”
The two real estate agents on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova are 26 stated as their customers, million.
"I looked at the cars and tried to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who puted his high roof roof as a venter of red pool like Joan Rivers.
The salon seems to live before the new riches, the kind of buyers of Russian brands available to make the shoe in the booms to come to a great interply where they are exhibited from the Cadillac Escalades, platinium canals, the Mövenpick glass, custom bills tables, apartments in Dubai and our Gund peppers.
The public could buy the bills for 30 euros ($44,57).
“The Russians are interested to define the most chrome and best marks” said Mr. Gijrath, putting on the royal use of hollandaise porcelaise Delf, before a wall table of Raimbrant on blue cars, made hand.
“It is certain that Russians are more interested in Bling bling”
In fact, the vendors said that the Russians who have old capitals (10-15 years are too much according to the Russian standards) have already been extracting logos in a limited edition mark that could not be sold in the room.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millions, emisors of millions or tourists, argue the exhibition every day.
And some bought even.
During the first night of the exposure, Thursday last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the King Koil PDG, declared that he sold two sets of stories in soi, cashmer, and coton included gold sons.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the A1 motor sale director, a company who teachs cars with last alarm systems, also declared to sell a Russian million, the Porsche orange, for $170,000.
From sudden, Andrei Karapetian, President of L.A. Connection, a company who personalizes luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to brackets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the road of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be included by Swarovski crystals to appear like a road road.
The set of four costs $2,000.
"The Russian Millennium who wants roads made of coat, or a photo of his wife who has been made in cut coke, will not lead strongly with such pneus," said Mr. Karapetian.
It is certainly going to keep it in its garage containing already 30 or 40 vehicles »
Even though many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karaquian said that the expression " Russian million" is not at the agenda, seeing the increase of the prices of immovable here.
"If you had bought a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're already a million years old, at least on the paper, if it's not in species," said he.
"There is more than you can think"
Those who are not millions may at least feel this emotion when they go to the state of Continental Alliance, a Russian heritage management society.
The company has entrusted four states representing the British Telephone cabs, filled with a maximum of dollars of contraffession.
Azad Karryev, the company marketing director, said that his team had printed 500,000 fashion bills for the Millionary Salon.
Passengers arrested to launch bill mass, asking their friends of the photographer on their mobile, in the middle of this rich fashion or well imposing some millions.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel millions of people,” said Mr. Karyev.
Cyrgyn has not been suspicious of murder in New Jersey
It was the ancient of Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked at the swimming bath of the restaurant Just a little healthier and watched a ambulance that was going to stop the doors of the White Cape Cod on the West Scott.
Then the police's cop is coming.
And then another.
“ Then I saw the medical vehicle stopped” Mr. Livingston, a director of the restaurant, said on Friday.
That's where I realized that someone died.
The authorities would then learn that the person died was an age of 41, Olga Arroyo, the Officer of the Newark police officer.
The investigators now tried to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gender executed by a non-cosmic chirurgy, that the police has not yet identified 212 of West Scott's adventure.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of the death of Ms. Arroyo, but they are trusting, the results of the toxicological tests that will take time, but which should allow this mystery death that attracted the high rangs of the police of Newark.
Ms. Arroyo was the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and his voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tenace," Mr. McCarthy said about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview, Monday.”
“It was like a bull pit”
“It would have done everything to protect me”
Mr. McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, an former police officer of Newark who worked for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two sons of 14 and 11, and a beautiful female.
Eileen Walsj, speaking the County Union Park, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo was deceived because of an unlimited chirurgic operation.
“It's a chance to consider.”
“The investigation is continued.”
The authorities stated that they were at 15:00.
And found Mella arroyo on the sofa.
She was described.
A little more than a week has been passed, and the authorities did not say greatly about the survey or even on the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not confirm if Mrs. Castro was asked by the authorities.
The investigators seek to understand whether a part of the house was used as a medical cabinet.
Mercredi, nobody opened the door at Melle Castro where a faned rose was staying in the cimetric street before, and a damnatine was in the back.
A blue bedon called "Ehyl Vanillin" used as a replacement of the bell in kitchen and for the parfums, was in a hangar, next to a door that leads under the ground.
Two glass all over the cotts.
McCarthy said that since his arrival in Newark had 25 years ago, the Department of Police of New York was extremely precious, helping him to ship in the new city and to leave his political culture.
“ She said, ‘You should take care of this,’ he told.
“ She was there when I came, and still there when I went.
“It was embarrassing”
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates related to the closure of the global bounce.
The actions are explosed by the two Atlantic units, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm the provisions of the credit, further reducing the rates of interest promoting by the exposing statements of the President of the United States Central Bank.
Business markets operate in London, New York and everywhere in Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decided must be " flexible and practical" in their actions in the financial markets.
In a clear effort to re-enforce irritable markets, Mr Kohn said that the recent turbulence was partly “involved some improvements in the market functioning of the end of September and October.
In the event that this hard turbulence should continue, it would increase the probability of a further rigidity of the financial conditions for owners and enterprises, as it said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capitals in the American markets and that further reduction of interest rates could be established.
These comments also allowed to calm Wall Street with more bad news on America's economy, such as the largest down of real estate sales for the month of Oktobre.
The impact of this financial tumult has been acquired according to the statement of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, announced that it will allow 650 persons, i.e., 4 per cent of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate losses from the loss of immunities.
20 posts are only planned in London where the bank is 1500 people.
In New York, the average industry of Dow Jones has increased 331 points, or 2.55% concluded to 13.289.40 while S–P 500 took 2.65%.
In London, FTSE 100 has taken 165.5 points, including 2.7%, which adds more than 39% to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Furthermore, the recovery of credit difficulties in the market has been reduced by the strong demand of a sale of three monthly funds undertaken by the Central Bank, which was due to these loan to the European trade banks at the lower rate of 4.7% since April 2001.
The pressures on the England Bank to follow the EEC and the BEC and to inject further funds in the London financial markets that caused credit tensions, have resulted in the rates of three months "Libor" of the British banks, resulted in their highest growth since September 6,59% from 12 November.
England faces an appeal to the court with regard to Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara's criticians.
We're faced two diagrams, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the Battery No.6 for English in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And more important in a larger context than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will take the decision?
The second matter is important because David Graveney, the Chairman of the electoral who was here exceptionally to help Peter Moores, Chief Leader, and Michael Vaughan, Captain, to take its decision, and because the Office of Hugh Morris, the Director-General of England, starts to complement candidate forms to become a national elector at least a part of time.
Whoever will not be able to bring the dose n°6 will be malicious, but life is often injust and sport is also.
It is never easy to anticipate what allows a person to arrive at the top of his profession while another will never happen to the lower level, sometimes by lack of chance more than by lack of ability.
It is not only that the selection is difficult, as at the end, the judge remains subject.
Is it the right time to emerge Bopara?
Is it just in relation to Shah?
The same thing could be proposed in another context, which would choose between John Edwards or Bankerjee Tubby?; both of them, new frameworks that have obtained good diplomas, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only a place for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a creditor unless it is given to him at least a chance?
The numbers have their importance in decisions but also in opportunities.
Inside a team, a creditor must capture the eye of the captain, at the same time it must take the door, and a batterer must be successful to touch the creditor on one day.
But capture the eye of the choices is much more complex.
Many better made the last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed to play the first test, even if Stephen Harmison was going to be completely disappeared and continued to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class gates on 33 tours to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 to the same average, but both have already lived their vision time at the largest level and hopes to offer still.
If it's going to be Shah or Bo Para who will play at the Ashiriya stage, it's just a question of opinion.
This choice could analyze or build a man's card, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and well successed in the first, with five gates and 40 useful tours, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also played for emerging, who succeeded to become the primary creditor of the Test, and that, despite the fact that his double hundred marked against Australia in Australia could still be signed.
The probability provides that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, after another discussion after today's session at the Assirian stadium, will certainly follow their conservators and will promote the greatest experience of Shah against the exhibition of the young Bopara.
The two have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his bright and considerable starting at the income of the Test of 88 in Bombay, 32 cents of first class against six for Bopara, which is seven years old at 22 years, and its excellent starting class.
But Shah did only ten tours during its two incomes in May against the Caribbean during the Testing to Lord, his Middle's city player, and that, the immediate refusal of the electors when Vaughan again forms his place for the next game, seems to have been encouraging his elections in Bombay.
In contrast to him, the Essex player is full of gladness to live.
Nothing fears him on a cricket field and he exalted when he recently moved on a 4x4 at a presentation of Volkswagen, the sponsor of England.
It was not reported that lightly wounded, even if the first thing he had done was to take his Vodafone (sponsor good on) and call Alastair Cook, his equipped equipped to him from far, to ask him if he had 'ha seen it?'
Bopara is the best batterer, his filting allure allows him to make services that goes to him, and he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choose the man just is one thing, choose the good time in another.
Maybe it's the real art of the selection?
I would like to give his chance to Bopara, what does not mean Shah should not apply if, such as the the tea sheets suggested, it will be him who will play this weekend.
Buss bring people to work and fight against Al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria has arrived in Bagdad yesterday, driving these outcomes without money or without visa renewments, or others who hope that the city has found normality.
Some are returned to combat warriors who disappeared them from their home.
In the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus, 800 people transported in decades of official bus contracts, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned through their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad” said Saah al-Qubaisi, a doctor Sunni.
"I came back today because I saw the television and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is now more sure."
“They say that the Mahdi Army does no longer fail!” said he, referring to the Shia Military of the Moqtada Al-Sadr Military of the Ecclesiastic Church, which imposed his men to disappear for the time.
Qassim al Atwani, a teacher Shia of 38 years from the Sunni Area's housed by the Sunni, was returned with his two children, because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the system prevents Iraq to work.
His neighbours from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform that the United States Millennium helped him to escape Al Qaeda from the West of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the chief of a Sunni tribe and Shia who had to leave his house in the north of Baghdad because of a attack on the border after he encouraged citizens to rebellize against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me have set an anti-Qaeda anti-million in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys.”
"That's why I'm coming today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years old.
Many say have been attacked by the growing acalmy from the capital since the American troops arrived, and on the continued training of “groups of armed citizens” and cooperating with the United States to defend their neighbourhood.
But others say they have been obliged to return from the visa problem and the decade of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqi have been over the past years.
Salaam al-Samarai, 51 years old, the father of three children, expressed the suspicion of all about visas for exited by Nouri al-Maliki, the first Minister Shia, who would request the Syrian Government to limit people to return to the country.
More than two million and half persons would have been from the country because of death-sevened escapes.
"We have no problem until Al-Maliki comes to Syria and urged the Government to no longer give Iraq visas to return to Iraq," said Sunni.
“ I can't trust a government who supports criminals that burned my house when I go. ”
The decline of violence may be partly explained by the fact that Sunnis have been shot out of Shia's zones and second versa, creating places where the tensions are less.
It is afraid that a sudden flow of refugees does not enlarge sectary tensions and return wars.
Petite Sarre, good training.
The smallest Federal State leads to professional training, even lighted by the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in a area that is a disastrous deficit on the Sarah, like the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for 50 times at a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - is the slogan that the smallest federal state, by self-derision, shows for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a great role in the Sarre's training system, which is set in the German economy Institute, which is the fifth monitored by the German economy Institute.
So, already in tradition, higher schools are closely cooperating with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by French.
To this day, students have the opportunity to end their studies by a double, see a triple.
The high quota of 15,6 per cent of foreign students is shown.
She also leads the children of the country to the higher schools above the average - many of them without a diploma of the Gymnasium.
"En Sarre, you benefit from the training system," says Axel Plonnecke, expert at IW.
More than five young people receive their title of studies in a professional school, and Sarre is situated at more than seven points above the national average.
So the possibilities of combining a professional and academic training are relatively developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the double cursus panel is the second best in Germany.
Although practical training and a growing demand, the number of diplomates in engineering has declined from a third in the past years.
This is why the Ministry of Sarrois education has obliged schools above a marketing campaign in engineer sciences.
"In the first PISA studies, we set a great number of reforms in general schools." said a speaker door of the Ministry of Education.
The Government has thus introduced all the federal state of comparison tests.
For children start early to learn, the last year of crystal is excluded from law - a model that can be copied by other federal states.
Some future comparison studies may indicate whether student performance is sustainable.
In 2003 PISA studies, the rate of risk students reduced from 29 to 20 per cent.
Nevertheless, Sarra has been improved as much as other federal states.
The bathrooms feel better.
And, however, the knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies, but could be gained points in this area.
Because the neighbor's language is obligatory in the licenses, even though Sarros are not French.
Hide shows
In Venezuela, the shows will be tic-tac shortly other than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will resume the chronometre of a half hour in the South America country.
Chave becomes a carriage in Spain in time.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela, a new law, shows will be held at least four hours and half of the universal time.
In this way, the South American country has an hourly fuss that does not exist in any other state of the world.
An American Chávez justified its position among others because the United States would impose the separation of the hours in full hours.
Furthermore, Chávez announced mercredi (local time) the ceasing of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, because of an housing case.
The left national announced that as the conservator Alvaro Uribe would remain the President of Colombia, it would not hold relationships or with the State Head, nor with the Colombian Government.
"I can't, already because of my dignity," said Chávez, who has a constitutional reform on which citizens of the petrol country will have to vote in the way of reign referendum.
With this reform, he would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The deterior of this debate was the decision of Uribe to retire in Chávis the mandate of negotiations concerning the release of housing with Marxist rebelles in Colombia.
Uribe would have "crashed in the face" of the Venezuela with this decision, had criticised the Sunday Chávez.
In Spain also Chávez is in all mouths.
A new portable telephone sonner is a hurt in the country: "Why don't you call" (Why don't do it) is the sentence that already have been downloaded over half a million people on the Internet.
She was announced by the King of Spain John Carlos, which was the most recentest Ibraro-American Summit enlarged by the constant interpellations of the peoples of the left.
A decrease of the wages is threatened by Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong conjoncture, according to a pronostic, a real less value of the salary threatens the German employees this year.
Experts have identified all kinds of reasons to explain their pronostic badist.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should wait in 2007 at a real decrease on their payment paid compared to the previous year.
"The fault is the low development of salary, the increase of the Taxe on the added value and the currency of food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for macro-economic and Conjuncture Research, in the "Picture".
New charges could also take place in employment insurance for employment.
The Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said in the magazine "New Osnrücker Zeitung" that the lack of employment insurance was 3,3 per cent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency has no right to be found in the barriers to ask the Federation of Credits or Financial Aids, according to the words of SPD Politicians.
It was Monday that the explosion of food products and hydrocarbons had increased the inflation rate for 13 years.
In total, prices increased from 3,0 percent from one year to the other.
Vénus is the dream of the earth.
Despite his hostile atmosphere to life, Vénus seems to be more than what we believed until now: the European Space Sond "Venus Express" discovered lights in the atmosphere and wind to the pools, like those who appeared to hit on Earth.
Since about three decades, scientists believe there are lights on Vénus.
The European Sond "Venus Express" today has shown the evidence - she discovered electromagnetic ondes at the limit of the atmosphere: Vénus lights spread to a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud, reports of Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous cyprine theory, lights would appear to life on Earth: the orange would stimulate reactions in the oceans which have conducted the training of amino acids, angles of life.
This is not the case on Vénus: "If there was a life, it should have been at a very old date of History", Sean Solomon explains the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
There should be no harm of living things today on the surface of Vénus: atmosphere is about 100 times more dense than on Earth, sometimes there is 500 degrees of temperatures.
"Venus may be the hell jumele of the Earth, but she remains a jumelle," said Russell.
Why Vénus, which is like the Earth in mass and dimensions, has been affected by a very different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important stage in Venezuelan research, since no sounds were on the way for the expansion of this planet for the fourteenth years.
In the Opinion of Researchers, the most recent research results that are now presented in several articles of "Nature" are not only emphasized by Vénus's uniqueity within the sun system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighbour planet are more than the first.
Thus, the researchers found the wind tourballs already known in the northern pool, a swimming cloud to the south pool, which is still much faster.
The phenomenon recalls the air rates in the hiver-whitchen hemipheres, written a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Institute of Astrofisica Spacial and Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the sun system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12.100 km, almost too large.
The qualified star planet at night or morning turns around the sun just 225 days.
However, it turns more slowly on herself: a vessel day for 243 land days.
Although Vénus, with 460 degrees of Celsius temperatures and 92 bar pressure, it doesn't remember the Earth, scientists believe that the two planets are established in similar conditions.
On the two, the water was accumulated and remained on the Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in Vénus space.
And while carbon dioxyde has been set on Earth in carbon form, it is the largest part of the atmosphere.
Shhler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama.
The Chairman of the Federal Republic of Germany of Kohler requires the end of the resort of the parties concerning the accommodation of Dalai Lama to the Chancelariat.
Indirectly, he criticised SPDs because of attacks against the chance after meeting in September.
The Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the appearance of Germany and the great coalition of closing the carrier concerning the accommodation of Dalai Lama.
"We must not present a nation divided on this question," said Köhler to the Tradeblatt.
Parallelly, Kohler showed the understanding for Dalai Lama's accommodation by the Unfortunate Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"The human rights have universal validity, even though I have respect for the differences between cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensible balance in foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the reproofs that it would organize a new Chinese policy.
The German chance has not taken its distances with a traditional policy of one China.
"The Chinese also knows," said Köhler.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had noted indirectly his comprehensiveness on the arrival of Dalai Lama and had been attacked so outside the CDU lines.
Steinmeier was complained, inter alia, of the CDU's foreign policy policy.
After the arrival of Dalai Lama to the Chancelry, virulent irritation feels in the German-China reports.
Thus the Chinese Government has not only recommended the Minister of German Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but in accordance with the information of the Spiegel, also made the dialogue on the foreign ministers of the two countries.
The Chief of the Government of China Wen Jiabao now requires the German chance Angela Merkel to recognize that Dalai-Lama was an error.
China refuses that European political men receive the spiritual Chief of Tibet in its official functions, as well as the Chinese position was supported by Wen Jiabao.
The words and acts of Dalai Lama would show that it is trying to separate China Tibet and other Tibet regions, which also includes other current provinces.
The skills are guarded against eyeutes such as France.
Street battle with police, turts, fire cars: Wolfgang Schumble keeps the eyeutes like France.
Everything must be implemented to ensure that the social insatisfactory in Germany does not cry into the streets of violence, the Minister of Germany has gone out.
Barricades that burn, cases that run on police with exchange fuels: after serious young people's epidemics in France, the Minister of the German Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar evolution in Germany.
We must ensure that social explosive is not also in us and is disastered in violence.
We have to take this to the series," he said to the "New Presse" in Hanovre.
All young individuals wouldn't get out of the rapid transformation of social reality.
The Federation, the Federation and Communities already worked closely to reduce the problems, said Schumble.
This would not only touch the integration of immigrants.
"The integration summits to the Islam Conferences are already shown its first success."
But it would be too early for a end of warning.
It is obvious to comment in the same time as in the German banks, there are no social problems or an urbanism point as in France.
In the northern Paris Agglomérations, young people were delivered to serious road battle with the police during the last night.
In Toulouse also, the cars and public buildings were burned.
More efforts to integrate the German Government, such as the President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of emerging emergings in France, Colat observed the "effects of emotion".
The situation in Germany would be so explosive as in France.
But it would remain a need for action.
Colat highlights that the rate of unemployment in youth under 25 years of immigration would be higher than the average.
It should first be necessary to ensure more places to training.
Colat said, "We need to give youth a perspective."
However, the President of Turkish communities added that a social control in families had been more placed in Germany than in France.
Many young immigration islands will not also destroy what their parents have built here.
Colat urged: "But we must even be wise."
Youth should be "without youth's opportunity to participate in work and training."
At waiting, in the Paris fauburg of Villiers-le-Bel, all remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter overwhelmed the area with projectors.
Three arrests and some burned cars and poubels were made by the authorities.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1000 security forces ensures calm.
The police will take the necessary time, announced the Minister of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit of the Faubourg.
In Friday night, nearly 80 policemen were wounded in the hills in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the next night, troubles would be dismissed in Toulouse.
The epidemics were fought after an accident of circulation in which two young people had lost their life tonight.
According to the first elements of the Park, the police is not responsible for young people's death.
In Angela Merkel's hope.
The entrance in the timosopic scene of the chance shows that the coalition has ended with the foundation - and there is nothing to wait for it.
In what country has this chance just seen?
After its desolate intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor content, it must be said that not here in the country which finally should be regulated by it.
The demand to focus too on the policy has been refusaled by Angela Merkel of a hard and presumulous sentence.
It's provincial, said she and just showed that she doesn't want to understand what the criticians want.
In the Parliament, she was all visible to what point this reply was exact.
There was no concrete interest nor guilty of feelings for the country's problems to feel.
Instead, Angela was present as a cloud: a politics in appointer, who was in the foreign policy, which even remains in the powder.
For example, climate protection: in this matter, it still welcomes the Holyndam Agreements, but does not say how climate objectives will be achieved in our country.
Even though the self-employment - having too little moderation, the CCD would have rejected it for two years ago.
Now it's cramping in formulas all done, that growth would touch people.
Thus it destroys her image of pragmatist, which addresss the problems instead of impressing the world.
But in the expansion of Angela cloud, internal policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
The poverty of children and the concern of lower workers?
He remains a few accessible phrases for this.
In this matter, the number of times it makes laps when it is family accommodation.
Here, Merkel needs three delays to propose a very specific sentence.
It is a unknown territory, from the moment where it becomes concrete.
The Attic Radius
In the discussion of Youtube of the Republical candidates to the President, the two favorites of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are delivered to a hard offensive battle - and now they have to fear a candidate outside.
The tension of candidates already on the first matter.
He would have made New York a "refuged for the clandests," he answered Mitt Romney to his adversary Rudy Giuliani.
The one against his side with hard reproachs: "I would say that his own house was a hair for clandestins" Giuliani answers and reply to the former governor of Massachusetts of having employed immigrants without papers.
As the Republical Base has not been officially favoured, eight candidates to the President served discussions on CNN above to discreet their adversaries.
The lovers of 30 seconds that Internet users have sent via Youtube are harder than suspicious.
"It's with this kind of isolationnism that we left Hitler to come to the power", launched John McCain to his candidate Ron Paul who is the only round to call an immediate refreshment to Iraq.
Romney also has a victory lesson from Vietnam, when he refuses to condemn as a torture called the Waterboarding, a questionary method where the noyade is simulated.
However, the fact that the important issues of the campaign take over time beyond the war in Iraq and the debate on torture are seen in the reactions of the Common Room of St. Petersburg in Floride.
The preservatory values shall be lowered or the future increases of taxes are rejected, the applaudments are delayed in the audit.
This is where the weaknesses of both favorites are revealed again.
"I made an error at this time," Romney explains ruined and presents its excuses at the base and televised public for having been a party of the avortment in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, passes into a coulant nest when his opinion is asked on the Bible’s literal interpretations.
Musharraf kingdom for the first time in civilians.
One day after her retreat as a Chief of Armies, the Pakistanian Musharraf man was invested as President.
Thus eight years of domination by the army ends.
The President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf has been invested on Thursday for a new five-year-old mandate.
The Pakistan's television was directly transferred the ceremony to the presidency palace of the Islambad capital.
Musharraf has swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the welfare of the Nation.
Mercredi had transmitted his head of army to his confidence Ashfaq Kiyani, and had thus increased international pressure, including the United States.
Eight years after he took power by a push without shed blood, the old general is now reigned as a civil state chief now.
By the rest of the commanding officer head of armed forces, Musharraf had filled the main need for opposition and West.
Another central requirement is the end of the emergency status that Musharraf had decised on 3 November.
Today a little after his investment, Musharraf will suspend the emergency status, according to General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus will fulfil another requirement of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the status of emergency with the jurisdictions of its lines, has rejected the last week all remedies against the controversial election of the Head of State on 6 October.
During five soldiers were killed in the north tribal region in the North Waziristan, in an attack against a military convoy, and four other wounds.
According to the indications of the army port port, a bomb explosed along a street near the border of Afghanistan.
Krautrock's fathers are back.
The overgroups of Germany in the sixty-seven years joined: the three members of the Harmonia Group again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return, there are records of their great success "Live 1974".
Today, they were well known to the foreigner.
The planned sensation is then produced in the form of three messagings announced at the evening appearance.
Everyone has his little drink before him, his cattle, and his buttons before him.
Dieter Moebius, to 63 years, throne in the middle of a white cham as snow.
He is flying on the left of Michael Rother, a young man of 57 years and has a portable computer and a guitar.
Right, observed by all the auditory, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73 years old, cut on his console.
Everyone contributes to the voice, among others a Beat.
And sometimes, this is inadequately gathered to a traditional piece of music.
This seems not to disgusy the missors themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia Group again plays a few emotions among Krautrock' lovers.
We have the right to deliver it here: targeted songs show that, of course, the name is reasonable in the collective memory of the pop, but in any case it is so sustainable so that the group is too painful for 32 years.
But why would the German not also have the right to celebrate his living legends in the sixty-day years?
Now more than what is called "Krautrock" is always more in England and in America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry decided in 2003 the Echo Price to the survivors of the Colonia Can for their work, the pop German faces were seen in the room.
When the Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups The Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Panegy area, the wonder had no longer limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother skipped on the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance in itself and the transformation in the knowledge is the only unique and unique.
The memory has already been taken by Harmonia, because the threeth was only two years and that during this period, the power of the impact that has occurred was much lower than what was granted by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler, named Cluster.
First of all, we played in the caves under the berlinic scene.
Followed in Düsseldorf, for a label subvented by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had recently moved into power and finally made a name as a guitarist with Neu, who was at the time, perhaps the German group the most radical.
However, in 1973, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exil in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in an old Weser close, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of communities who fled the city.
Ideologically than in the "Commune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to make tours as sweet.
Pluts an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
Soi-dependent was in the pool a fantasy of the Harmonia Ottenstein Choral and also a name for the art.
Many of them takes Harmonia away from that.
The first album is called "Musik of Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
Since the music was also sire and moderate, the group suffered of material miserable.
The crowd of the dead wood was not served only to seek himself.
The "Live 1974" CD that has come to observe has been registered in a concert in Greece before a public record of approximately 50 heads, and someone believes to remember.
Rother put the desire to encourage Harmonia to take time.
It was for Roedelius and Moebius a immoral requirement.
The group announced its division in 1975.
Rother atterged in the spheres of the hisotherism and ensures that it exists with albums like "Flammende heart" (shore in flame).
Cluster reanimated in the fourteenth years and has been more successful than Harmonia never had.
We need the Live Griessem's album in Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland has set the purpose of introducing Krautrock as a German contribution to contemporary music.
New! It was already disappeared at this time as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia was located in the World Cultural House in Berlin.
Publicly subsidied, within the Festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the British, old punk and author of the poke book Krautrock Sampler.
There is also the winner of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
As a result, the whole fluctuation margin of Krautrock's influence would be moved towards the future pop music.
The location left by the group will be combined by Harmonia.
The phrase of Brian Eno plans in the room in the middle of the individual sounds: "The only true music, you listen to the future."
There are photos showing the producers with Harmonia in the closed room.
The projects of other black and white photos that are caused by bacer served for the training of the lending.
Before, the three vessels are re-employed to improvise.
But more by choosing microphones to the orange and battery, to drive the inother sound instruments through self-building instruments.
Today, the electronic music appears to the electronic music.
The three in large technological fibres.
To that, even the house's collar will not change anything.
Sub the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, you are all and chuchote under the cloud of sounds, and we're shot at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
He's never fit to rock.
The racines were less searched in the blue than in music conservatorys (Can), in the Craftwerk technologies or in the escape of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
He who cries "68" has not totally false, and Harmonia also now lets us go to this now.
But whatever happens is going to be covered at the scene.
Where's the music starting and where's she ended?
This can taste on the nerfs of someone (?) or give great joyful flights.
Richard Gere isn't just enough Chinese.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Paix murder," two films re-extreme the Balkan war.
But the two are not convinced.
Thus, projects are too far on the action and the exchange of insensive tours, otherwise they are too widespread.
There, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: certainly, Karadzic and Mladic war crimes are always hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is just there, in the most slightest pays of Bosnia war, that the actor Richard Gere is then found.
We've been lastly lost to see the most beautiful man in the fourteenth years, because we've been very nice and soft in female feelings films and too many press conferences on the boddhism's theme have sought to show him.
Today Richard Gere is soon the most important argument to look at when even "The Hunting Party" - when the driver becomes heavy ( why should they today be so long and confused as collective conventions of local leaders?)
He delivered a great representation of full eye clinics: at the bottom, his person to report war Simon Hunt is what Gere could become, if the destiny and film industry weren't also well-being: a man who had his best moments for a long time behind him, but who, even as a monument in decline, had kept the visible remains of his old charm.
But, despite this attack, "The Hunting Party" continued together with the German production "Paix murderer", which is also coming this week, the interminable follow of films ratified on the Balkan War.
"Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt" can be done quickly: the film speaks of two German troops in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who are saving a slave of cosovar francs, where one of the two tombs still soon loved.
Although it is welcome that the Serbians are not present for once as the only causes of all mass, this movie is likely that a telefilm loses too fast in the action and the exchange of insensive cracks.
This remains a kind of "Alarme for Cobra 11" without authorized but with a war on place.
On the other hand, we can consider the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why there was never a real film on the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who constitute to pain the high war crime "he could become, with another realisant and another scenario (tot two to the time Richard Shepard), at another moment "Apocalypse Now".
Because the story looks like a frank way: two males will go into a small team in the forest, to make something that the military cannot do and for the two males, it becomes a journey in the fool.
One of the reasons of the "The Hunting Party" is that we are just not allowing Simon Hunt to be the desolated chysic out of a heart, as he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must grant him to surround a romantic adventure with a Bosnia killed afterward.
Then "The Hunting Party" is definitively bad, when reporting it, in the space of five minutes, by accelerated process, it appears that OTAN, CIA and all sparers of the world have not succeeded in five years: take the war crime and let it for just winning to Muslim Bosnia.
It is so bad that the International Court of Criminal Court should be taken against the Chinese logic.
In that case, the film has a too deep human concern.
He wished to demonstrate that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (which they must be exclusively agreed) to not lead the drive in sufficiently intensive due to secret political agreements.
But the desired good and the evil are this time so similar as a famous poem of Brecht comes to the idea.
The one speaks of a wood mask of a Asian devil on the poet work table: "Component, I see the vessels of the gonflee front, clearly: as it's smooth of being evil."
The Hunting Party films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumoring heads, but they continue to what point it is wearing to be well.
The problem is not limited to the type of films on the Balkan War.
Received, he was reported in this newspaper that all hollywoodian films on Iraq were large flops.
It can be added: there have never been good films on South Africa.
What is every time: when a star runs on a crising fountain or a mine field, it was then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jeans aller Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still too close at the time.
Whatever it is, the decades are always past before Hollywood can turn a good movie on the Holocaust with "The Schindler List".
Some films still have to marry - those who today have classic work on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been unanimated in any case as the heads of work.
But perhaps today we can also know too much about the conflicts of the world, where each hectare comes directly on two screens at the same time at home,
And this raise the scanists the lack of groups they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Sheep or not be" or "The Dictator" are also become as well as because Lubtic and Chaplin had not yet known what the nazi regime was really dominant.
Maybe he doesn't want to be good when we want to do good movies.
Maybe it should have the artistic and sanctuary view of the Roman Lawrence Norfolk.
When it was questioned on the parallel between his historic Roman "Dictionary of Lempreère" and the Balkan War, he said, "There is only the fact that some things never change."
"The large cities will always be terriblely dangerous, men will always be killed in an horror way, and war will always reigne in Yugoslavia."
From Beust recognizes the critics for the cancelation of Olympiades.
Hamburg's candidature for Olympic Olympic Game has been disappeared in the policy and the economy of critical virulents.
Many wants to continue to fight for the games at the water side.
But Van Beust calls for the reality in the appreciation of chances.
The Chief Director of the Hamburg Trade Chamber, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a left as "mavais for the local economy".
The last time, no other project had been deployed so much of motive forces in the city than the Olympiades idea.
"If this goal, the political-porting elan could not be maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate to not enter the project, but to find him a new starting point at a longer term, "which takes another agenda point to begin."
Ole van Beust was left in mercred to his previous statements, as the olympical ambitions of Hamburg were ironists at least until the year 2028.
"It is not Hamburg who decides from a candidate to Olympiades, but the German Olympic Sport Federation said from Beust to WELT ONLINE.
He returned to the decision taken by the Federation of Sports At the beginning of December, on Munich's candidature for Hiver Games in 2018.
This preference means for us, that, in the time we had planned up to 2028 until there, we will have no chance."
However, the dream is not finally in the past, said by Beust.
The Hamburg Sport Federation (HSB) regretted Beust statements.
This would be given the impression that Hamburg will no longer have his candidate for Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"There is too early to close the opportunity, entering the projects now," said the President of HSB Venter Ploß.
A candidature leave would be more contrary to the statements of the Head of the Senate at the time of the meeting of the German Federation of the High Sport Schools.
There from Beust would be qualified by Hamburg's candidature at the Universitys of 2015 as it was "no substitute" to the olympic games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Top Schools of Sport was first in the past weeks called Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD race of the master reproached to the Senate that it had not been used this precious time in the construction of housings in Hamburg.
"The development of the Petit Grasbrook was rejected by the Senat for years because he played the Olympiades card and excluded the construction of housings," said the Delegates of the SPD Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always claimed to the Petit Grasbrook a integrated plan in Olympiades and a later use of housings, the CDU would exclusively put on the "Olympiades" factor.
The 2012 Olympic Game candidate would have made a great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg was angry against Leipzig.
That's not Warhols' chains.
He who takes the concepts of Sweden and falls in wood, thinks of Ikea, but not to Andy Warhol.
Or if?
At that time, in the Sweden, the shadows on the list of Warhol's works are thrown.
A large part of the eighteen Brillo-Boxs of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfactory.
After the Swedish "Expressen" magazine has certainly found a few months ago the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxs of Andy Warhol, the internal research of the Moderna Museet of Stockholm is today on a decanning result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", whose former director of the museum Pontus Hulten made cadeau in 1995 in Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as a large part of the hundreds of other Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which drew on the international market of the art.
The old story is encountered, a wearing that results from artistic and healthy productions.
In 1964, Warhol created its first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, pearl caves, based on the red blue-blank design of savon cartons in powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his work to Moderna Museet presented in 1968 with Warhol's agreement - the hundreds of cartons Brillo made: These were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were directly delivered from the Brillo cartoning factory.
It was not here of art workers, but rather of their models, of exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given the authorisation in 1968 to produce a few wood cases in Brillo in Sweden, which were not expressed to the Moderna Museet.
Many of the time witnesses today speak about about 15 wood falls that at the time would be right in the history of art and stores, as Brillo-Boxes authorized by Andy Warhol, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them reached in the sales of more than $100,000.
The problem is now that the Legendary of the Muse Pontus Hultén had said, injured, about hundreds of wood cases had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would then be delivered to him.
The 105 Cases of Hulten were only produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition to St.Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol was dead for three years.
Lars Byström, a conservator of the Moderna Museet, was examined, next to the six Brillo-Boxs of the museum, three other Sweden private collections, between which two were confected in Stockholm in 1968: their strategicized panels were first printed and placed, then was applied with a piinture piinture in the white oil.
The texture of the copys dated from 1990 to the contrary that the peinture was directly applied without a base-shake on the controlled panels, with a roof of pearl - not more than a pearl to oil, but a acrylic.
"These cases have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of the Brillo-Boxes d'Andy Warhol," let the Moderna Museet Director, Lars Nitve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York is not another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six cases in his collection as copies/exposition-master."
The Board of Authentication has already heard that it would investigate the "related accuses" which will be deemed to the case of savon's powder cases.
But since we're gone out of an unexorable silence.
