Prager Börse turns back against business lock in Minus.
The Prager Börse could correct the losses.
The transactions with the acties of ≤EZ reached almost half of the normal day work.
Prager Börse bore the same as at the beginning of the Sunday's ministry, as she felt more than six percent points.
This time the reason was for the explosion on the Wall Street.
In Tskchy also, the reaction of the market has been shown on the result of the vote of the American representative House that had rejected to support a stabilization plan for the external financial sector.
The case of the acids in Asia
A dramatic case occurred on Sunday, the acts at the buses in Asia, even if the indexs were able to compare a part of the losses during the day.
The index of Hang Seng Börse in Hong Kong lost almost four percent points during the business day, but later a part of the losses could have been lost, so the decline was reduced about 2.5 percent.
The index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which observed the movement of Chinese acties at the buses in Hong Kong, was about 3,8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The acids at the bower in Sydney lost more than five percent, but the losses were decreased at 4.3 percent.
The bulks in Taiwan were 3,6 percent after the heat index.
"The Timing for Rescueting Action in the United States is uncertain and the financial markets will affect globally," said the head of the monetary authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong decides, although it belongs to China, its monetary policy itself, therefore, independent of the Chinese Central Bank.
The rates in Hong Kong move to the same level as those in the United States.
The American lawyers should return as soon as possible to the negotiation table and decide the draft support of the financial system.
In other cases, other countries would be affected by the infringement.
A Bath bathroom of American acids
The American Representative House dismissed the plan for support of the financial system for $700 billion (feight 12 Billions Kč) on Monday.
The legislators have thus ignored the request by President George Bush to support the plan.
Bush considers that the plan would regulate the basic reasons for the financial crisis and therefore help stabilize the whole economy.
The American acts experienced a sand bathroom on Monday, and the most important assets marked the greatest infringement in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index smell nearly seven percent, a similar infringement in the last year 1987.
The index was already mentioned before the vote, but there was no signs that the project in the deputy house would not be done, the index had a free case.
Congress makes a competence: US government can 700 billion dollars to banks pumpes
The top representatives of the American Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush have joined a broader form of an agreement on a financial assistance for the American financial system.
This should be resolved in the next week.
The American lawyers reached the discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial assistance for the American financial system in an overall of $700 billion (and approximately 12 Billion Krones).
However, this means not yet a victory.
However, the Congress Councils have to discuss some details of the agreement before they can publish the final definition of the law and vote it.
The financial support plan is negotiated on Monday in the American Congress.
On Sunday, the Chairman of the Committee for Banks and Finance Services said that Barney Frank of the Agent Reuters.
In the Senate, different information may probably be fixed in the middle Thursday.
Economys should be informed that the plan should be decided to be the first significant psychological factor for the experience of the financial markets.
However, it comes to a "country" because of the complex mechanisms, how to help markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have achieved a significant progress.
We have explained our different views about how a package should be seen for the stability of the market", said the Democratin Nancy Pelosi agent.
In accordance with your words, it could still come to a final vote on Sunday.
The representatives of the legislators were meeting the night on Sunday with the American Financial Minister Henry Paulson in order to grant the Government's final form.
This provides a sale of unrealised hypothecactive activity from financial companies that causes serious losses and threatens the stability of the whole system.
"We stand at the border of a definitive agreement on a plan that will be working and that must be effectively on the market.
We need to continue the management plan, but I think we're on the goal," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis also clearly affects the acquiring markets that are strong.
The words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, as it is, are the legislators who are seeking to reach a final agreement before Sunday in the Congress.
In fact, the investors would like to take care of business on the Asian financial markets that are in the first time area where the Congress decision could affect the business on Monday.
Until the time, it is not yet clear when both rooms of the American Congress will be voted on the law, even if the negotiations could not be able to address a problem in the last minutes.
The lawyers hope that it will be adopted in the next days.
However, the law will learn some changes.
The aid of the system shall be shared in two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars should be prepared as soon as possible as President George Bush asked.
However, the Congress can block the exemption of the rest of the money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, in addition to $100 billion and the final $350 billion.
Bush estimates progress in negotiations positive
However, the President has a veto right at this Decision, but the Congress can vote on the Veto.
Despite these changes, however, there is remaining the basis of the programme, which is based on the lower, financials for the purchase of lower hypothetics which are valuable because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to pay their hypotheks.
"We've worked everything.
The representative house should be in the way to vote on Sunday, the Senate then on Monday, as the republic Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress made.
His speaker Tony Fratto explained that Bush was satisfied with the progress on Saturday and "valuate the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of Gold Fallschirms
The Chairman of the Bank Committee of Senat Christpher Dodd, who was responsible for the legislators had been responsible for the money programme, the protection of taxes before loss, the end of benefits and a time plan for the financing of the plan.
The new law should also include the so-called gold casses for the directors of society involved in the programme and put an committee to be monitored by the Fund.
This should lead to the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and reached a great progress towards a agreement which is working and is important for the market and for all Americans," Paulson.
The plan also recalls aid for households with problems with the reimbursement of their hypotheks.
The Government should negotiate new hypothecs that they buy, with the aim of reduce the monthly costs for the debters and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is a good idea after the main economy of Patria Finance David Marek, but the implementation will be very difficult.
"And therefore, because you don't know what mechanism and what prices the problem-activity will be bought.
This will be a vital way to share the losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said to the iHNed.cz server this week.
If the plan is adopted now or the beginning of the next week, Mareks is not proposed.
"Much more important is that the Congress Members have some to support the plan and they have decided it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement that it comes to a decision is the most important at this time," said Marek.
Duell on Messer Schneed: MP3 pilater against Handys.
We advise you at your choice
While almost every MP3 mobile file can play, you can't call MP3 pilater.
So it seems that it's better to buy only a phone.
Nevertheless, there are sufficient reasons for why you should create a special player.
The election depends fully from the kind of use and the answers to the future owners.
You are surely buying a huge plate player to listen to the latest ticket of Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such musical news are not appearing on LPs and there is no objective reason for this.
However, you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the Regal, you probably dream at least of one such.
So this is also with the music on travels, so with compressed music, simply expressed - music in MP3 format.
There are also prices and quality categories here.
For one, it may not be acceptable to give for a player eight thousand krons, but a pink-Floyd factor will probably make a hard headhore for twenty krones from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each.
The selection is widely observed.
The lifetime of the bacteria is also crucial.
Some good music players can play more than only music, but what you can telephones do not even create analyzeable way.
No modern device is to use such universally as the phone.
Besides the primary functions, telephone and Simsen, it can resume music and videos, both, it has a better, a poorer photo device and may be able to navigate.
And if you're still involved the smartphones and computers, it's almost a small computer in the box.
It's a little wonder because no kitchen can smell and no televisors photograph.
However, the universality of the mobiles also brings shares with themselves.
More functions you use on your mobile, so often you will need to download it.
And the playing of music is one of the greatest energetics.
Only few mobiles can play more than ten-12 hours, mostly it is much less.
In this regard, music Player (specially the most easier) are clearly more efficient.
So you should assess the fixed phones that they can't play more than a few hours of music.
If you start and call on again, buy for the safety of a device for the office, this applies also for the hardest devices.
For MP3 pills you will not have this problem, even keeping less than 9 hours without interrupted operation with one time download.
Another problem is if you want to play the music on your telephone.
Unfortunately, there is only a lower part of the devices through a USB exclusion, and it is not possible to include any telephone without special software directly to a PC.
Of course, you can play the music directly on a memory medium, but only few card read devices will be completed without reduction with the small memory cards used in mobiles.
You need no special software for players to excepts (iPod) when players.
You need the device only to fill via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobiles and players themselves put a music library, ordered by the name of the interpretation, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the evaluation by users.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address directory, such as Windows Explorer, some can both (river, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent telephones with operational system).
Player are easier to use, mobiles can more
If you choose a concrete device, you should also learn after the lifetime of the accurr, memory capacity, quality and the type of sound and, of course, as well as service comfort.
It's music for you mostly useful and you can hear it every day just shortly in the road track, then it's just a favorite mobile that plays MP3 files.
What's actually any phone.
You don't have to check otherwise what music formats can process a mobile or a player.
MP3 creates all, and the most music you get, it will be just in this format.
The format is the most widely expanded, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Meanwhile AAC is usually used (a format, apple and iPod).
Better mobiles also allow the purchase of music online.
You only need to retain the sides of a provider (or other provider), and you can already buy a song or an album.
This service can already be an argument that can be made to be a music manager.
Unfortunately, the offer of the Provider is bad and is only limited to rapid radiohits.
The prices are not even the lowest.
But it is generally likely that this kind of sale of music (see it via GSM, Internet or drought Internet) in the future will be managed by the music industry.
The telephone takes the most of them.
If you're nice to listen to something, take the phone in the jacket, while the player's forgets at home.
However, it is about whether you always have a head-auditor or at least a driving free talking institution.
If not, you can get back to the integrated layouts, almost every mobile, but only less MP3 plate.
The most likely benefit of musichandy will be to many at the price.
The most balanced costs usually less than three thousand krons.
For three and four thousand krons, you already get a total special Walkman.
The greatest Handicap will be for most that no normal heads are there.
The best and technically trained phones with a 3.5-mm opening for normal heading audiences are costing up to 50,000 krones.
The benefit of the players is again in the easy service.
The easier - and not unfortunately (see selection) - player can really use everyone.
A minimum of functions that is the identity in treatment with the previous normal case recruitment or, for example, the platform player is clear.
There is no collection in form of a irregularly designed mobile Internet and then horror account for data transfers.
After which devices you need to take now
The most comprehensive mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) also have a plate for exchanged memory media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy an appropriate card, enjoy two thousand krones.
But watch.
The base-dollars are usually supported only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the darkest cards can also read 8-GB play cards.
If you already have a phone and want to buy a MP3 pileer, then take cowon, creativiv, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
After capacity (max. 2 GB) you must then not put more than 1100 krons on the table.
Listen to the audiences, please take specialized mobiles - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have own service officers for MP3, and the management comfort is thus moving to a particular MP3-player.
On the same way, Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles from the series of Walkman have the same user interface as the individual MP3 pilaters sold.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand krons, but with a higher memory capacity (for 16 GB) and a long-life life period (normally 15 hours, maximum to 35 hours) provide you MP3 pilars of the above producers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to Tschechien in this year.
Maybe
The Mobilfunk market in Tsjish is directly equipped to provide Tskish providers of practical offers all services as well as their partners are offered in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, there's something that mixes a virtual provider that leads to the classic to lower prices.
Maybe this is not going to wait for a long time.
That the Czech Mobilfuncan providers are working on the most old in Europe, and we have already reported on mobile.cz.
This also confirmed the Telecommunication Authority, which noted that the price for a SMS is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming fees, it is likely to come to a paradoxic situation - for some of the Tschech Mobilfunctors, SMS will be more low than home.
How does the prices in Tsjish are so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is easy to miss the competitiveness that really makes a fight.
Maybe it sounds paradox, there are three mobile networks and a penetration of over 100%.
Mobile firms are pleased to fight that there is extremely much competitive in the Czech market.
It is often required to the President of the Council of the Tsjechical Telecommunications Authority, Pavel Dvoak, which often explained that there was no place for another provider in the past.
It is likely that a classic provider with a own network has no longer many opportunities (hereinafterly, he would likely find no frequencies.)
But there is another opportunity - a virtual provider.
Along with the entrance of virtual providers on the Mobilfunk market, a clear price synthesis brought on which the classic mobile carriers had to react.
There were still voices similar to the market in Britain, such as Tscho Mobile or Virgin Mobile.
However, it has been shown that there is a place for such providers and that they can really be successful.
There is no longer need to search for examples.
In February, we have reported this about the start of the virtual provider motive in Poland.
In only half a year, this provider was reached to win more than 100 thousand customers and then to the largest provider of the country.
The Penta's financial group, among others of Tskchychy, is the one of the other U:phn.
The benefit of virtual providers is that you can focus on a great more concrete group of objectives.
To be able to function effectively, virtual providers need much less clients than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, the operation and the conversation of a mobile network.
In the world's profile, virtual providers usually exit as low coast factors - they offer available telephone talks and SMS, but often accompanied by a less wide service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in British SMS offers at least a half of more than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobilizing in Poland shows, it may also be a fairly well-bearing to put on a non-clical target group.
These providers are specific to men.
"Your kitchen choose motive - the provider who loves and trusts them," David Seibert, the CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the supplier of this virtual provider.
Before to say whether a similar concept, such as Polonia, could throw foot in Tsishah.
This is unfortunately, the presseur of Vodafone Miroslav íepický: "The Tskchical market is a market segment on which most virtual providers are relatively small.
In addition, it is relatively satisfied from the view of the service offer."
In the Czech Unfortunately, my mobile posters
However, it is almost sure that if a virtual mobile carrier of Czech will not be mobilizing.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations do not have otherwise hopefully.
It will come to a market entrance of Mobilking in other countries of our region," says a phone talk for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, the Press Representative of the Penta Group.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the current mobile carriers in Czech are not otherwise advertised.
Nevertheless, they're trying to do all that no potential competitors are encountered.
Your interest at the start of a virtual mobile provider shows the GTS Novera group that wants to take a further step to become a real competition of telephonica O2 in the field of business currencies.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only festivity, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And every time, that's better.
We have reiterated this option with all the Czech mobile carriers.
With some of them, we have already been able to reach negotiations terms," the Presshearer of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
Maybe there's better time now.
From non-offic information, the first virtual provider may be expected to the end of the year.
But until the time, this is delayed from an unwindable wall of the weakness.
"With this time we don't think that there is a full virtual provider in Tsjichian place for a full virtual provider.
The Tskchy's market shows great speciality against other markets.
As long as we have not mentioned a comprehensive and series project in this area," he said in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Mrše's press department of Telefónica O2.
More providers also show on the specifics of the Czech market.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the O2 Declaration: "Therefore we have not found a vital and mutual project that can continue to build."
And she adds: "The network of T-Mobile will take a virtual provider to the end of the year.
At this time, we should have a concrete offer to think so shortly."
Vodafone is more attention to the fulfilment of the requirements of its 3G license.
Miroslav íepický said: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers we are open, especially in the field of participation of costs and infrastructure.
We're looking at this from the view of the customers than the best.
The main Vodafone strategy in this area is in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - with the providers in hand
The action of the mobile carrier is easy to understand that another provider has more competitiveness, which would lead to sink prices and thus lead to a decrease of the benefits.
So why should such a competitor facilitate the market entrance?
That the providers can go to a street if it's going to do something, also makes the long step and Her around the removal of U:fon.
The most strongest pressure in direction ◆TU went when U:phun came on the market, from the T-Mobile society.
This also provides the public accessibility of the μTU sites.
But now, you are just unnecessed as a argument why you don't have to allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The motorfunk market environment was shortly strengthened by the marketing of a fourth mobile supplier.
In view of the characteristic of the mobile function market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that a new actor on the market itself and in particular its services would be high".
However, in view of this fair way, the Mobilfuncan providers are surprised the absolute interest of the Czech regulatory authorities.
It is not only about the stop of the TU, unfortunately in the Czech, different from the British and other high-level countries, which have no competence to join economic competition.
This is exclusively the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, this concerns all the problems of this problem, its entire typical stop.
"The market entrance of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after it was reached to a contract agreement between a mobile service provider and a virtual provider on the adoption of the necessary infrastructure.
Until this contract has been concluded, since the offer of potential interests probably was not sufficiently interested for the classic providers," in his response to our request by Christian Calupa from the Department of External Relations of UOHS.
The representatives of the providers would not be surprised by such a formulation.
A authority representing consumer interests and, among others, should consider that no one missed its position on the market is more sensitive.
In particular, if Christian Chalupa adds: "It is the foreign where virtual providers work fully normally to be observed that their market accession has contributed to the price of mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure is likely to be the correct functioning of the market and price reduction not to the interests of the UOHS.
In this case, the almost slow consent of the three mobile corporate providers, which turns out of their reactions.
The question whether it is really about an accident, is on the hand.
Like the absolute benzin price at the tanks, it is certainly only accidents and the effect of a hard competitive campaign.
"In this case, the Authority has not discovered any signs that are deemed to be a trade against competition, and therefore it has no reason to take any kind to the matter.
No one of the providers has a dominant market position, so he has not increased the corresponding responsibility for its business on the market.
The necessary instruments for opening the mobile function market for virtual providers are likely to be missed by the Authority for Telecommunication”, Calupa stated in its statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many stakeholders.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by the TU, after telecommunication from the view of economic competition, a single market is.
There is, of course, no of the Czech Mobilfuncan providers have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer another view - for the marketing of a virtual provider, it is always necessary for approval of the network provider.
And the Mobilfuncan provider has logically the monopol network.
It means that it takes a dominant position in a certain segment necessarily.
Even if you do not agree with this argument, it should be at least a warning that three mobile posters are similar to the UOHS.
There is a number of interesters (including the company GTS Novera) that they have been in negotiations with all providers on very similar obstacles.
The resolve of the responsibilities to the μTU is then a legal trick in the telecommunications services, with which the UOHS is detained from all the matter.
This was already watching in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the news of the telecommunication law has not been able to implement the extension of the competence of the OECD in the field of economic competition in the telecommunication, even if a number of teachers had promised an improvement of the situation.
This must only be well known by the representatives of UOHS, but probably have other interests.
It's happening when nobody looks
Unbeachted once the functioning of some pseudovirtual providers, of which it is in the Czech Mobile Services.
There are companies that provide their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services that are only partly public.
Usually, it is about companies that operate in multilevel marketing.
Custom mobile phone services are offered for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Star Live and others.
The price lists of these companies usually are elected only.
The testimony of the matter is that the company against the operator is a classic company quote, which is a large number of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it will then receive special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the business conditions of all Tskchych mobile suppliers provide a similar shopping sale.
"If there are cases you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will take care of what can lead to cooperation with the relevant society," said Martina Kemrová on our question.
However, it is incredibly uncertain that such a thing is not about the responsibility of the mobile carriers.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it may be a thousands of customers.
However, no operator is contrary to such an action.
In fact, they are not intended to pay them to self-determinate benefits, but they will, in the same time, be not imposed by the actual virtual providers - on the basis of the actual official branding.
On possible problems, Miroslav μepický notes: "The law allows such types of speculation, however, the services of these companies are used only by a very low percentage of customers.
They should also accept that the SIM cards in their phone do not lead to their name, so they cannot be fully available as the normal customers of the mobile cards."
Only this should at least come straight.
Another question of the UOHS will be opened.
Close the mobile cards before such an action, why do they blame against a virtual provider?
It is to add that the UOHS has legally strong skills to discover such activities, and if it does not wish it should not be made with the declaration of the providers that they would have nothing to do so and their business conditions would be satisfied.
When Czech is no longer the one
As noted in the text, the virtual suppliers income had a significant price reduction in the various services.
This is practical in all countries where virtual providers are designed to try classic providers to prevent their detection practically more or less.
The arguments used by them were practical - a too small, or too very collapsed market, problems in quality of services, etc.
However, in the high-level countries, the regulatory authorities in these moments have directed the interests of the mobile carriers but attempted to be true of their customers.
If it was formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved the first virtual operator and the following.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are thrown all the case like a hot cartoff.
Without our experiences, we can't find the impression that uncertainty in the competences in these cases is more positive than in these cases.
But let's not throw the flower into the corn.
If the background information is collected and a virtual provider quickly, the Czech mobile market may soon be put into move.
If a provider allows the removal of a virtual mobile supplier, the UOHS will not remain inactive if it is going to dismiss other interests (discriminately).
And then, the cups will finally not be calling more clear than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Hymne has four new versions.
Search the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National Hymne.
On Sunday, Premier Minister Miek Topolanek made the day of the Czech State at a festival the new adoptions of the National Hymne Wo is my homeland.
The hymne was newly played by the Orchester of the National Theaters under the leadership of Ji月í B הálohlavek.
There are four versions available - with male or female single, in choricity and in an instrumental version.
Together, the records were transferred by Keithera Knåínková and Adam Plachetka.
The hymne versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can hear at the same time all four versions.
The Czech National Led is one of the most beautiful hymnes.
Before he told the Czech Rundfunk, he had chosen for the Solo-Varian Sängers with young, representative voices that are marking and loved.
"At first, I've been trying to keep a clear declaration in order to understand the text so that it can be agreed," said the Deputy.
The Czech National Hymne is the next year on July 175.
The Loed Kde housev m月j arrived first in 1834 on the beach of the continuing theatre in the original Tsychical part Fidlovačka of Josef Et Ethan Tyl, the music held by František ◆kroup.
It was popular, and people took it spontan.
The first stage of the loede was then after the decrease of the Czechoslovakia in 1918 to a organised part of the National Hymne.
One of the seven State symbols also remained after the origin of the Czech Republic.
Like the "new" Hymne
Prager transport operators also promote a chip at middle
The middle of October 1, 2008 will enter into the history of practical transport operators as a date in which the first carrier, road trail, or bus takes the carriers that take a electronic coopon into the board.
These can now buy about one hundred thousand people who have the Chip map Opencard.
Travels can buy a 30-day, a 90-day or a year-day shopping (augly 1 January 2009) and play them on their chip card, although in the information centres and settlements of the transport companies at the U-Bahn stations of Muzeum, Mádraí Holešovice, and Only, Lesaany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons are also available on the Internet sides of transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was taken up to the afternoon hours of more than four hundred customers.
Those who use the Internet sale can really forget the shipmaster in the U.B. Statistics, where they had to wait regularly in long shoes on their paper vehicles.
In fact, they buy the coopon on the Internet, this is played on the Opencard in one of the three town librarys.
"In these places, the travelers are also available to a card with a special staff requesting the interesters on the internet buy and play the coopon on the card," says the speaker of the project Martin Opatrný.
Besides the library, the electronic coupons can also be able to play the open cards used in some U-Bahn visuals.
How do you look like these cars?
You're red, remembering carrier values, the drivers may have already noted in the U-Bahn stations Roztyly, Bud月jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"In the city there are five of them until the end of the year, but it should be eighten times," add Opatrný.
The coopon controls a carmate instead of the driver
The service of the cars that are working tomorrow is easy.
You must only introduce the chip card, and the previously acquired coopon plays itself.
The electronic coupons apply from tomorrow not only in the main city but also in the environment.
So, in the presidentities and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants of the Mediterranean municipalities have arrived in the main city.
"In the thresholds that are integrated in practice, the drivers have the reader devices with which they can check the validity of the coupons after time and zones," Philip Drápal by the Organization Ropid's organization's controls. This organization sets the car plans for the Prager Transports.
The prestad buses have card read devices at the card chain in the driver.
The chip card should not only be predicted at the driver but the opencard is to be set at a marked place on the side of the box.
The driver controls the power of the coupons played.
"When a carrier checks the power of the coupons played, it is nothing easier to ask the driver to ask these information," said Drápal.
A carrier that does not run with pre-style buss and no longer know when the coupons' ability ends, can go back to self-management automatics where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information about the validity of its documents on the device display.
The Sudans invited a peopleship from the United States
In 1945, the South Dutchers had requested the engagement of the Böhmerwald to the United States.
This provides a letter that sets in the collections of the Southern Bambohmic Science Library.
If we can't be a part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the United States' force.
In 1945, some groups of Southern Summits should be applied to the US Presidency.
This provides, among others, a letter that has been received in a private archive, which is kept up today in the collections of the Southern European Science Library.
The Germans from Krumau in the letter to the American Presidents, he should not allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" adopted on the basis of the Munich Agreement of Hitler to the Czechchoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation right and really wanted to make sure that the American units are not to be a subpressor and enemies of the German Territory, but as a free man," it means in a letter signed with the words "Mens, which are the shape of the Sudans".
Since the conclusion to the Czechlovakia, the Southern Ushers, in the light of the Czech National Charakter, would believe that they would expect Brutality, Unconsciousness, Unconsciousness, Understanding and Slavery, ask the officials of the letter to the American Presidents today and forever to transmit the protection authority on the guard.
"We can't believe that you're not in a view of the view of a four-million inhabitants of this area, a foreign State that is underprised and tried to remove minorities, and has not yet been able to gain the Allied", is to read in the letter.
The reason why the defenders cannot sign, it is obviously the fear of the "Tschechical subpressors".
If the U.S. Presidency is uncertain about the management of the gun-developes, it would be sufficient if he wanted to initiate a decision in Böhmerwaldgau whether the inhabitants would be part of the United States or under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter, in today’s knowledge of the next war history, it is a good image in view of some newspapers in respect of the timely expectations of the Southern Upps.
Even though the European Germans at least had to be treated about their disappearance out of the Republic, few of them had been in place.
Some expected that the United States and the British would have an autonomie in the South.
Others again believed they could just stay in the Czechoslovakie.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who is out of the budget.
He was set in the war as a Buddhist German Budget at the Middle East Sea.
When at the end of the war in the British captivity, he brought him to a war captain of Holstein, decades came to him other böhmic Germans, he wanted to bring them twice.
"They believed that if they were home, they would come to them the Czech," said Kalupa.
No one of the German military prisoners who had lived before the war in the Czechoslovakia was acknowledged his view that it would be carried out on the basis of the Beneš Decree from the Republic.
You don't think - then pay it!
A emotional download campaign goes to car drivers
Sustainable action on the roads in the Czech history.
It also allowed the emotion loaded media campaigns to be characterised that the ministry wanted to start on Wednesday.
The Authority of Minister Aleš ◆ebíček promised to take drivers of dangerous behaviour behind the Lenkrad.
The campaign for 150 million krones will be seen in the TV, in the radio, in the Kino, in the Internet, but also on flyers.
It must take the driver from too fast drivers and alcohol on the tax.
And they also remember to provoke the trips.
The campaign wants to speak mainly to young drivers, motor drivers, footballs and not last also professional drivers in conscience.
And what will be shown in the spots?
Besides the stories of people calling emotions.
The "Blue" Slogan of the whole campaign is also born:
You don't think - then pay it!
The words "no" are "not" in the Great Book Taxes on a sign set.
And in a clothes of blood is then the word "pay".
This should mean that you can pay a moment without attention to your own life.
The Spots will be shocked up until 2010.
The Ministry began to inspire similar campaigns in the angels countries where you can see completely images with drastic acquiring of accident victims.
It is promised that the accident numbers and the number of roads fall on the Czech roads are reduced.
The Spots were collected by the Agency Euro RSCG.
Suckerbrot and poetry for cars
"For the driver, Motto Zuckerbrot and Peatche applies.
Zuckerbrot means that they, for example, are going to rock time.
The peak is then the rocking of punishment or accident.
The driver must be recalled to the risk," the hospital's psychologist Na Homolce Martin Ko月án.
This is why information campaigns are required in the press and especially negative advertisement, the psychologist means.
It is even less effective of his view to tables that the drivers make attention to a danger.
"When you open a static table that warns before a danger, it will probably be stopped shortly with the environment, and the drivers will no longer understand," says Ko'án.
Olmert would nearly resume all areas in peace exchange
The President of the provincial Israeli government Ehud Olmert has spoken for the reimbursement of all the areas set by 1967, as well as Jordan, Oskrusalm and Golan Hills when you can close peace with Palestine and Syria.
This he revealed in an interview printed on Monday of the day of Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach a agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it is necessary to pay nearly all (related) areas, if not all," Olmert said in front of the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have a similar percentage of the Palestinians (Israel areas), because it will be no peace without this," he added.
He stated that a possible return would also include ostjerusal.
"There who wants security in Jerusalem and does not particularly want the tractors or Bulldoer to ruin on his legs, as one of my best friends has to have to doubt on a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in playing two attacks in the city in July, with which several people were killed and ten people were defended.
According to the Premier, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temples and holy and historical places" situated on the territory of the old city.
"He who wants to receive Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will need to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work", he further strengthened.
Alongside the golan hairs
Olmert said for a decline of Israel from the golan hairs, what is the view of an unconsiderable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
This would also require some efforts on the sides of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to close with Syria only and only on the basis of a peacekeeping out of the golan hairs," confirmed Olmert.
"Sirians are only well knowing what they need to make back to golan hairs.
They will need to address their current relationship to Iran; they will need to refer to their relations to Hibolah movement; they must be able to make permanent support to the terrorism of the (chemitical) Hamas movement, the Terror network Al-Khaida and the Dschihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister.
Questions after accident: Are Stewards illegal?
The law does not know, in a telecommunication, the transition is not allowed
With regard to the tragic accident of a business of the Student Agency in the neighbouring of the Italian Padua, the question is whether stewards and travelers can be moved and moved during the bus.
"When we are striving and formal to keep the law, it is the work of a steward against the law on the road trafficking", says the speaker of the Minister of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in the last week, a twenty-year-old Steward's life, probably was caused by the driver of the LKW, who made the bus the way.
The young woman sat at this moment at all unfortunately next to the driver, on which at least safe place in the car, even if she had two other places.
However, a bus can also have an accident or breathe, in which the steward coffee or newspapers are exposed.
A role also plays whether the bus has been equipped to the car sheet also with roads.
If this is not intended in the bus, the travelers must sit.
The telecommunications of Student Agency have no steel posts; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed on updates.cz.
"We have discussed this with the Ministry, and this has not first agreed to the movement of travelers.
Afterwards, we have taken this, and we have made a consensus where the travellers can go to the toilette when they have their seat," he shared his position.
The law does not know Steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legal provision describes this role.
However, there are no legal provisions provided to the applicant to provide services.
The Law on Road Transport only knows the vehicle manager; but its rights and obligations are not clearly defined," the speaker of the ministry Hanzelka adds clearly.
The Director of the Division of Road Vehicles, Josef Pocorný, considers that the law covers these problems at night.
"It's the point of view whether the bus has also places in product approval.
It's all right.
Buses are divided in the city bus where there are stars and the highest speed is limited, food buses with roads and higher speed and television without steel stations with the highest reliable speed and seats that are equipped with security warrants.
Like the aircraft, the Fachmann says
The BESIP transport security factor Jaroslav Hoíín sees in the movement of Stewards to the border of a bus.
"After a flood vehicle, the situation is comparable to the service at the border of a airport.
Even here is not sure when tumulines come, and the Stewards can shake the head."
"Again, however, the bus has begun, then, of course, apply the laws of the physics.
Just like in the city bus or in a street.
The security of the stewards must clear through internal regulations," he also means that this problem is not completely removed from the view of the law.
Jančura is ready to strive the services
Student Agency offers as the only Busfirma Services of Stewards.
The company operates approximately two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider its profession after the accident as a risk.
"When I get the impression that the profession of Steward is riskable, I'll strike him.
Coffee and newspapers can receive the travelers when they get.
It would also reduce the costs," he says.
As a security interest, the Director of Asian Alexej Litvin founds the lack of Stewards in his bus. His society only has a band of lines compared to student agentity.
"We don't have stewards, we're already at the beginning.
Before or later, it ends with any death accident," he had not expressed a year ago for Týden.cz.
That was an unbelievable tragedy
In the case of a line bus to Neapel, a young stewards in the region was unlawful of Pilsen who worked for the society two years.
The Slovenian LKW was likely to be removed without locking from the position and the bus had stopped the car.
However, the carrier tried to disappear through a crazy manager, collected with the right advantage of the LKW.
The two places were sold for the Stewards, Jančura.
"It can't be reserved with telecommunications, they are blocked."
Firma's gonna create LKW factors.
The Agency will not wait for the court survey, but a financial debt rate, but it is also awaiting from the sides of the fault.
A change of laws?
Not in View
A more precise regulation of the movement of Stewards at the border of a bus could provide a legal regulation to which a thirty-hoc expert of the Ministry of Transport worked over a year.
"It is still a concrete conclusion.
Buses are not even unlikely on the agenda, rather than the pointing system, the maximum speed on the car and the use of mobiles at the trip", says Fachmann Hoaín.
"The ministry of transport does not consider the work of Stewards that could significantly affect the security of travelers," Hanzelka, whereas the security of the bus is in the competence of the police and employees.
Düsseldorfer hopes to Frankfurt
In large words, there is no absence in the letter of the WestLB word to the employees of the house.
A collaboration of units of the Düsseldorfer money Institute with the Frankfurter Deka-Bank may include the central capital market of the Spanish Finance Group, which is known in the Monday's letter.
The WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable payment force in such a business.
Instead, such connection could be the key approach to further contributions in the country Bank sector.
Thus it reads if an emergency in difficult time to demonstrate action.
Since the westLB killed is under control of pressure.
Not only on the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Office for Finance Services, which the Northern Western Federal Government has just recently cleared the time to find a future solution.
From one like always likely link between the Deka bank that knows the spanish cakes for their investment fund, and the WestLB has already been talking on the Frankfurter side for some time.
Zwar has been able to know Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas at the presentation of the half-year numbers end August, in a fusion of the house at the Mainzer Street with a countrybank, about Helaba or WestLB, he does not mean.
However, the Deka’s Administrative Council, which is engaged at half of the country banks and the Sparish countries, has the intention of conducting the WestLB discussions on common business activities.
It could be about the capital market or parts of the capital market.
The conversations have been free, so it is in the financial place, just started.
The Deka bank, which numbers with its 3000 employees to the most important employees in the financial area Frankfurt, is not the first time the talk when it goes to consolidation in the Spanish sector.
2003 it appeared a moment as long as it could fusion the Deka bank with the Rheinland Plant and the Helaba country Bank.
However, there was nothing out of this third-party connection.
Kaum's plans were made public, the Hesian country government said to participate in the Helaba.
So the two other houses were not found each other.
The Landsbank Rheinland-Pfalz took place at the countrysbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, it has always been thinking about the connection of the Deka bank with the country banks.
However, last of all, Prother Merl, President of the Helaba, had spoken against planing games on meeting with his house.
However, it seems to be awareness of the knowledge that a compression of the different homes of the public sector is not necessary.
After now the countrytags selection in Bayern, the BayernLB can first be closed to the BayernLB connection with the countrysbank Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba, this is not a good news.
If the pressure grows to further fusions, you will follow and follow the partners.
In the south, she would be only Juneor partners, although she has overcome the financial crisis even so much better than the households in Munich and Stuttgart.
A re-congress with the West LB has the Sparcase and Giroverband Hessen-Turingen, who is involved in the Helaba's 85 percent of the beginning of the year.
Anyway, the North LB has left.
Those geostrategic talks are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of each house are adapted to each other.
In June, Mr Merl expressed the vital question with which business model is to ensure the future ability of the country banks, whether the German Spanish and Girloverband are not yet responsible.
The West LB may also be a clearing of the West LB, but it is not self-respected.
Thus, in the letter of the sovereign term, it will be undertaken for the house a "common solution".
As it allows to bring some units with the deka bank under a hair, it will still be shown.
The second Visnwoven is known as "Italy Womening"
For Elena is the first, for Luca, the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena's like his friend, and it's all different, he says.
Besides them, at the five-level bar of the Marke Kaiser, a massive edge is built and demonstrates about 200 October feest travellers, whose deep exhibition can be made.
Elena gives Luca first a clothes, then a cosy.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From here, the buspark next to the Poorta New Bahplatz, starting at this evening at 23:45 hours four buses, "destination Monaco, Birra festival", at 6:30.
Three buss are mainly maintained by Italians, exclusive Brazilians.
In an eck of the park place, the South Americans already sing at their feet, they have already felt in the night.
And so sound, says Marco, that's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who holds a long mantel with pilzimiat flowers and a sheet with wide silver sheets, includes the bus.
Since five years, they went to October feast, three tours are alone in this year.
night, day on the Wiesn, at 22:30 p.m.
On the night, it would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the road, the Welcome Storage with Caser-Bier, used by the Bayerian cleaning offer, the hospital and German travel - Marco has visited a Sprachkursus in Frankfurt - including.
And now the bus in the night, on the direction "Brennero".
There's no beer, no more.
Soon it will be quiet in the bus, sleeping the travelers.
Well, they'll still need their forces.
In Brixen and wood kitchen, some other bus with Italian characters in the carway 8 short before mounting is still a pause.
Finally, when Marcos’s group is planned about half hours at the morning near the Ethiopia, there are the 50 other bus out of Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a last talk, explains the attack plan.
First: Set the yellow button.
The left "Octberfest", then the Internet address of Marcos travel office: "concersiveding.it".
Secondly, "When the doors come to the bierzelt, it is running!" calls Marco in the morning.
"Back!" go and set the places in the back side of the cell.
"Now before, otherwise we block, and not all the beams to the same bottles, distribute in the room!"
The measure, full of Marco, costs 8,25 euros.
And don't forget money.
"The security leaders show that we're doing good!
When you leave the places, they are gone away."
Third, "It's the point to find half eleven again here!".
And it's going to shot.
A yellow chapter is binding to the trees, to shelters and even to the chosen plate of a great Bayernian party.
You'd like to be kidnapped for the back.
It is the second Wesnwown known as "Italy Women".
There is no true information about the numbers; the speech is 50,000 people who make themselves on the way about the Alpens and enter into the bierzels, ten percent of all visitors should be registered in this weekend extra from Italy.
The Munchner police is strengthened by seven police officers from South Tyrol, the Italian voluntary assistant supports the Bayerian Road Cross, which leads a national statistics, where Italians are at Brits (and some 60 points) and Austrians (and about 80), with about 200 medical insurances.
Specially loved in Italians is the guest.
Sleeping night for believers of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stative, dedicated federal finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only in the past week.
As well as politicians used the word "relative" and still emphasized that the German bank sector will not disappear from the critical developments.
Because it's now in the weekend.
The Munchner notified in the Dax is an ongoing finance of Hypo Real Estate (HRE) from a consortium of German banks is a billion credit to disappear from the tourbs on the markets.
One person trusted by the situation said Reuters on Monday, the credit aids have been lodged up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate should only refer to the part they also take.
The money comes from private and public law banks.
The background are lost at the daughter Depfa.
The State financing manager had made a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he had paid money, extremely short-term refinanced - which is not yet possible because of the unbelievable confidence on the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's barrier was of 95 percent to 2,37 million euros, and the capital rate was easily 1,6 to 1.45 percent.
The current amounts and the net contracts from financial charges were in line with the pre-financial period, the amounts of claims for claims and certain values, as well as the solvent of refunds in the credit tax are more than 70% to 5 million euros.
Only by higher reimbursements from reimbursements of calculated costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the reimbursement of estimates in accordance with the reimbursement regulation, and from the business insurance for consumer companies, the expenditure of approximately 16 percent was still moderate.
The former State financing manager had first speculated its privatization with global real estate credits that were then expensed in the Air Bank.
Because it was too little in the classic State financing, the depth was then increased in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects of private investors and the State (private-Public Partyship, PPP) and international diversity.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate now has to take descriptions that have a "entity material effect" on the gains and loss of the group, it is inequitable.
Actually, the division has been thrown.
In 2007, it was cut two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been an important public and infrastructure funder since the depfa survey.
It is more depending on the refinancement of the internal bank market because it has no customer installation.
With the comparison of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the credit delivery has been re-enabled by the banks, since banks were ready.
The Hypo Real Estate needs an annual part - approximately 50 billion euros - of the credit card of the Depfa short-term funding.
According to the hypo Real Estate, the funding need of the group has been discovered by the credit and the company "for the impact of the currently functionable international monetary markets".
From other sources, it is necessary to hear that the moneymen are secured by the refinancement until the end of 2009.
The Chairman of HRE, Genorg Funke, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to take the money markets in indefinite time.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Finance Services (BaFin) provides that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secure.
This is the hope of the bank's actionnaires and believers.
But in view of the dynamics and incompatibility of the crisis, there is probably no conscience.
It is not even impossible that the funding should not be fully assigned.
But the contrast is not disappeared.
After the afternoon of the bank’s insolvency, it could at least not be able to endure the guests in the past summer.
The rate of the achat is 75 percent to 3,30 euros.
It's right to keep the license courses.
If the priority debts are not moved, the courses of the backing bonds are more clearly followed.
In particular, the contracts of the previous filial Württemberg Hypo are concerned and, of course, the periods outcoming over 2009.
In the first time, the Hypo real-Estate allocations of the Hypo-Estate must be considered a speculative installation-related changing, according to the significant strengthening of the bank crisis and the itself Institute, which had taken the crisis first to be in the house, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as notes banks, governments and less proposed business banks are still ready to support the system as long as the pensions can be paid.
Or it is what it is not to hope for someone now - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the coming 15 months.
However, in view of the reports proposed with the Part Statement, it is only a reasonable hope that it is now.
This should, above all, prepare some sleepless nights with the decision whether they should separate their commitments.
A short-term leader can always use a loss of loss for future reimbursement payments for courses later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
As Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, at the first school of Tachibana High School, the girls are going to touch: the German is total "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange logg she tells it about Japan.
"The first schoolday in Japan.
I was scared.
Before the school, I had a Bammel.
I live on the border Tokios towards Kawasaki and run 40 minutes with the train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, I didn't miss.
It seems not to be fixed at Taiwan as far as we are at home in lower acids.
The students run at eight hours until about twenty before nine times a short conversation course with the teacher starts 'home room'.
But before the teaching began, I was on the set to imagine.
I'm not the guy who loves talking to people, nor before a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school form yet, I met an old Rock of my guest, so Blue, blue knee paintings and black leathers.
In this regard, I made me before the pult and tried to say all right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I'm called Sylvana, come from Germany and have a week birthday.
At the moment I was very glad that I started well two years ago to learn the language.
The 31 girls in the class have all snipped, clothed and shot and I have heard the word "Cawaii".
I already knew that from my manga.
It is part of the survival word chain of Japanese girls and means 'none, sweet'.
Then I'm fast hit on my place.
The girl's next to me, she's very wide, she found a pride that the exchange should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quiet, but when the gong turned, I was regularly killed.
Everybody talked to each other, kissed and asked me the lungs in the bath - it's really difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then they packed all their Bentos.
My guests had also made me a Lunchbox - that's something else than the paid German paid breeds.
I had a journey with corners, small corners, salts from gyps and algens, woods and a kind of flesh in the tofumantel.
I don't have any kidnapping, what exactly I'm eating here in Japan.
The things look astonished and are fully nervous.
It's a festival that everything is real lecker.
Oh, well, until the saloned plants may be, prrrrr!
The Bentos aren't just dinners at Japanese schools.
Sometimes it is expected that a girl makes a child prepared bento itself, which then makes it specially art -- in the hope of learning the boys at the Pausensnack closer.
This is what I read in my Manga-Comics.
I'm glad if I can watch this.
'Why's it? 'They asked my friends when I told them that I want to go to school for a year in Tokio.
I always said,
'Cause it's me all right now.'
Finally, I read the most lovely mangas for years.
And so that I understand the comics and the culture in it better, I also started to learn a little Japanese.
So it was completely clear that I had to travel here sometimes.
Because I also have a feable for tradition, seats and breasts.
And there's a great value here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends on the other side it is a stretch, decisive and traditional country.
And because everything is so good organised, I haven't feeling lost here even if Tokio is the greatest city I've ever seen."
Also Rats have feelings
A race or a damage flights in danger is that it also receives fear?
Joseph LeDoux's new scientist is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Only how could you check whether they receive the same if they are similar to us?
The Internet magazine Edge has been published for several years awarded scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presented in a series of responses to the question "What are you keeping true without proof of it?"
I believe that animals have acceptances and other consciences without any other way I could prove this until now where we couldn't even prove that other people have awareness.
But in this case, at least we must hope that all human brains show the same basic configuration.
However, when we apply other spectrums and clamp questions of the receipt or generally of the conscience, we are indirectly delayed because the equipment is not agreed.
If a Ratet is in danger, it makes the same as many other animals: she is dead, fly or grew.
People are similar to what some scientists are closed to a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to translate our subjective heritage to animals.
In order to close almost always the human conscious crisis to the former pre-frontal Court (with its participation in the short-term measure and the execution/ fiscal functions).
This wide region is much higher than the other principles and seems to miss in other creatures.
At least, in those aspects of our consciousness depending on the Court of Justice, including the knowledge we are, and the ability to plan and decide, it is therefore the reason for the adoption that the person is even different from the other principles.
Another dramatic properties should be found in the human's interpretative nature: since such a large part of his life is connected to the language, it is often that the consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
However, even if awareness does not depend on the language, this would certainly affect animal consciousness so that it might be determined, probably very different from most of our consciences.
This is why it is difficult to identify how awareness can be seen in other animals.
If it is, as an intern and subjective thing, nor measured, nor analyzes because of the special equipment, based on our own experience, it makes us our research on great problems.
Most of my executions relate to the content of the most knowledgeful experience, but there is also another aspect of the conscience that scientificly simply should be accessible.
Awareness process of animals could be studied without awareness of their contents, and it is actually happening in studies on the short-term reduction of principles, in particular in the visualization.
However, at this approach, after the Christian Koch and Francis Crick, you are more likely to be the nervous correction of the conscience than the causal mechanisms: both of them like to be identical or not.
This approach also emphasises the importance of the preliminary Court of Justice for the Convention of Visualization.
What's going on for the receipts?
I emphasise them that an emotional system, such as fear, will be active in one of his own activity.
What we describe as "Free" is the mental state in which we find if the activity of the localized disaster system (or their consequences, such as physical reactions).
As a result, receipts are closely linked to the regions of the Court of Justice, the principles and in particular the humans.
Containers with the parliamental nature result in fairly disappearances of the receipt, because we can differentiate and classify the conditions of the word and the graphic in order to describe others next to us.
For example, Antonio Damascus means receipts from primary activities in the body sense regions of the Court and the heroessam similar to Jaak Pankseep, which is more focused on the hirn stage.
Since this network has not been very changed during human evolution, it could be involved in transactions.
Reine theory I can't resist it, but it is unrecognisable.
Pankseep argued what appears in Rats and people as fear, probably feels like this in both cases: How can you be able to check whether Rats and people accept the same if they are similar?
A damage flights in danger if it is a fear?
In my eyes, light behaviour can still not demonstrate equalness of life.
Since it helps the Neurale comparison further: Rains and people have similar herds, shapes do not even a brain.
But is the hirn stage responsible for receipts?
And even if you might prove this for people, how would you like to show it with advice?
I think that Rats and other sugars, perhaps even shapes (who knows?), have receipts.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their receipts are likely fundamentally different from our (for human consciousness is based on specific crises and languages), I would like the emotional behaviour than the emotional emphasis of Rats.
Anyway, this is progress on the neurale level, unless you misses the same thing with Rats and people.
As I have no language and awareness at the Councils, I don't know whether it exists.
You can keep it shortly, but I'll like to go forward than stealing against a wall.
I'm just a practical emotionlist.
Uefa President Platin: Grateful time for Poland and Ukraine
The Vice-Premier Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be made under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of Uefa in Bordeaux as a evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize EM together with Poland," said Wejunik.
"But this is no amnestion for our country.
The work has just started and there is still much to do in two countries."
In the timing plan for construction or reconstruction of stadies, roads, hotels and airports, the two guests are behind.
The number of EM stats may be reduced from eight to six.
"We can no longer lose time.
We need to work now with highest speed," said the Ukrainian President Grigori Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep us constantly in the eye."
Another radikal step was decided in Poland.
The leading of PZPN PZPN is undertaken by the National Olympic Committee and is replaced by the independent manager Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission was held on the question of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
It means "the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to act in accordance with the rules", said Drzewiecki of the Polynic Notice Agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platine in a letter that the preparation to the EM 2012 will not be conducted."
Several prejudices were condemned only in the past season because of manipulation to the growth of juice, finally the ligastart had to be thrown shortly.
Consequent Dennis Quaid kills back
She wanted to promote a new movie, said in the interview about privates - and now she has anger with the Ex: Hollywood-Star Meg Ryan expressed her lacking Dennis Quaid as an adulter.
He's crazy and kills back.
Advertised Rosen War at the Ex-Ehepaar Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their disappearance, the two Hollywood skills are now an unfair fight with each public.
Meg Ryan was in an interview with the U.S.C.T.'s last week for the reasons for the pregnancy: "Dennis was a long time unbelievable, and that was very terrible."
The dimension of the drug has only brought it into experience after the deterioration.
According to the soul stiptease, Ryans press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of an adult will be told.
Dennis Quaids reaction on his outcome as an unfortunate marriage came clearly: "Unfortunately" said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News", that "Meg to repeat the story of our relationship again and around."
It is also "timely," that the common son of the 16-year Jack again "popular pain and the circumstances, which means a disappearance for each child."
During Ryan lives alone since the shopping, Quaid has been married again and recently became a father of concourses.
And then shut his approvals with the page's pleasure: "My life is going to go anyway.
I feel happy that I have a wonderful family that is best."
Scanning prices for air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and oversight in Europe were more than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even 50 percent higher.
Flights and oversights in hotels have become more convenient - that is the result of a trip and financial service provider American Express.
The company has analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and set out a significant impact in the second quarter after an increase in the first quarter of the prices.
After the prices increased in the hotel market for years, the oversights of many types have already been banned.
From January to March, the prices in 41 of 48 researched European cities have remained average of 6.9 per cent compared to 2007.
But from April to June the prices have already been lower than in the previous year.
The most significant trend in Paris and Rome had been, where 30 to 37 percent had to pay less than one year before.
As a cause, American Express sees the weak dollar course, who has led to a "againing trip of American tourists".
Financing places such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decrease of the hotel prices as industrial areas such as Hannover, Oil or Stanger.
In the northern city, the hotel prices hold with an increase of 26.3 percent even the record in Europe.
The trend in the first quarter also showed up:
Percentages of carbon disappearance had to be in the economic class in the past 7.1 percent of more paying than 2007, the intensive inflammatory flows were even 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the prices for air tickets of the economic class were average 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the Business and First class the price changes were less.
In Germany, the prices were still stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March, the prices were increased by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they were 23.6 percent.
On German domestic flights, the prices have even measured in the course of the study.
A reason for price infringement is on the basis of the economic growth, the company explains.
The request in many segments of the aircraft market will be slow.
On the other hand, the Open-Skies Agreement released the airport between the US and Europe is an increased competitive pressure.
Signs of the situation noticed are the increase of unprofitable streets at Airlines, and the high number of airlines reported in the first half of 2008 conkurs - only these were 24 airlines in Europe.

He believes that the tabler interface is more for the incompatibility of the liga than for the Dominanz of his HSV.
The manager with its late commitments - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the Torre Petric, and the Jansen ship from the FC Bayern - is slow, not yet able to laugh them.

Dark Materia affects space flights

Experts fear that the general relativity theory Albert Einstein could not be completely right.
It was 18 years ago the "Ulysses" room on the world's space.
Soon you're led to the cold by raining trailing trays.
Scientists provide a mystery phenomenon for the devotion - the Swing-by-Anomy for years.
The Swing-by is a spacious airmanager in which they receive additional weak in the gravitation area of a sky body, around the earth.
Thus, the songs can spend a lot of trial materials.
The European and American researchson of Cassini has used this physical trick as well as the sunsond Ulysses.
However, what the researchers are surprised for years: the aircraft is not 100 percent to how it would be expected in accordance with the former gravity law.
Moreover, it comes to unregularity in speed.
The songs will be unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until the physicians couldn't explain this effect.
They baptized him with Swing-by-Annomalie.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general relativity theory Albert Einsteins, which describes the power of the material by a rotation of the room, could not be completely right.
The American Physiker Stephen Adler by Institute For Advanced Study from Princeton believes that Einstein did not ignore and try to explain the Swing-by-anomalies with the so-called dark materials that have been explored in the University.
"The responsibility of the annomy could be a dark material that could also be closely close to the earth," he wrote.
From the existence of the dark material the world's researchers know for about ten years.
Of course, it is a force of associated with its effect on other heavenly bodys.
She itself is totally invisible, which means sending and reflexing none any any electromagnetic radiation, particularly not visible light.
After the calculations of the scientists, the dark material always makes a fifth of the whole mass of the universe.

"We will observe all aspects of this matter in the next weeks to see what alternatives there is to protect apartment companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The rates in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, the percentages will be doubled for a full year, and it might be so twice.
Since construction companies are non-sociational organizations, their members shall have to pay for costs either through higher costs or lower rates on spar accounts.

New investigation in the US State Procurement Office
The American General Agency has commanded a special ministry to address the declaration of the nine Member States in the United States in 2006.
The statement was a report of the Inspector-General of the Minister of Justice, in which the work of the Administrative Employers were criticised.
The report made critics to the officials of the wise houses, legislators and the former General Officer Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation has been made by the fears that the applicants have been removed from political reasons.
The Special Middle of Nora Dannehy must now clarify whether the officials who were listed during the investigation have an angel to disappear the justice.
The first prerequisite of criminal actions have not been completely studied or clarified, but the General Inspector Glenn Fine said in his report.
The vocation of a special ministry with the ability to spend the Witnesses to expose, was one of his main impositions.
The conflict started as the Minister of Justice in December 2006 nine US candidates from their elections.
Today, the Ministry argued that the lawyers would decide on the basis of weak employment services.
However, later, it was noted that the declined State complaints were not worse than many of their colleagues, which many observers allowed to consider the preachings as politically motivated.
Some of these complaints were involved in the prosecution of high-range republic Congress members, while others refused to investigate the prejudices of election of democrates.
The US state complaints are intended to investigate and pursue cases for the government.
They can always leave, but they must not be removed from political reasons.

Other officials, including the former president of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the experts.
Meat Loafs Epischer song must be addicted
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be guided during the music price reduction "Q Award" for his episode Hymne "Bat Out Of Hell".
The Scanner, the next week in London, will accept its special gold price during the decrease, said he was ready to be recognized.
The song that takes nine minutes and fifty seconds was the title chapter of Meat Loafs Hitalbum from 1977.
"Coldplay" includes nominations for the price delivery of this year after it has come into four categories in the closer selection.
The Chief Reaktor of the magazine "Q magazine" Paul Rees said that there were some songs that come out of such materials as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song filed by Jim Steinman requested a strong voice that was delivered by Meat Loaf.
It begins with a instrumental part that takes about two minutes.
The loed appeared in Britain as Single in 1979 in the sale and has reached a 15th place in the Charter.
Today, Meat Loafs "Bat Out Of Hell" has lived about nine years in the Charter and sold more than 40 million in the world.

In 2007, he had to assess the concerts based on an attractive capsuling.
Later, he was recognized that he had a cyst at his stimmband.
Obscure road in town, often forget and may quickly sell
New York City has thousands of main movements, only, page routes and other roads of transition, some of which are famous and others.
However, it is even hard to say to the taxi drivers and long-year-old place where Extra place is, simply because most never heard of it.
This swimming road is located in East Village and seen from the first street direction Northen between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching the second street.
It is 30 feet width and 120 feet long and looks out more after a smooth drive than after a active roadway used.
There are no road screens.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard stage plan.
However, this road has its wonderers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a building company which has created shortly luxury buildings on the first street.
It wants to create extra place new flavors to create a cleaner journey to the shopping and boats that are expected in the new buildings.
For others, the long-year neighbourhood is the long-year neighbourhood that says it is infected by the short gap, simply because she is one of the worst of the past of the home blow.
However, the City Administrative Division responsible for the protection and creation of the accommodation and the road is responsible for the road has no interest to receive it.
During a meeting of the Committee for Agricultural Use of the Council in this month, representatives of the city manager and Avalon Bay have developed a proposal for buying the road by construction companies.
However, the Committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city, and has asked a new plan to be presented in the coming month, so Susan Stetzer, who is responsible in the community Council 3.
"Only very little room is stayed in the property of the city and we want to hear the extra place over the city," she said.
"It could offers how to resolve the road and take care of what Avalon could be performed, but we also want that public access remains guaranteed."
Avalon Bay has announced a few months ago that the small roads new flavors and seats that are thinking for a coffee, where the company wants to offer room.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was the first time during the meeting in this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker of the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road but wouldn't have anyway.
"The Avalon Bay headquarters are to renew and make it to a public meeting", she said, and added that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, speaker of the building protection department, said that it was actually the desire of the city to sell the road and suggested that the service’s task is more to develop the real estates than manage.
Compared with his huge neighbourhood The Bowery, an extra place has kept some of his historical impression.
Some believe that the road has received its name in 1802, as a great farm, who had heard Philip Minthorne, divided between his numerous children and no strike country was appointed.
The backdoor of the music club CBGB, the Punkrockdenk that was closed in 2006 opened to the Extra Place and the road is most known as the cart for the photo on the "Rock to Russia" album of Ramones.
The complaint was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, who made the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of shots, lumps and parts of fiss, posters, leaves and seilens.
Some residents, including the bloggers that write about the generalization of the East Village, rejected the idea of sale of Extra place, with the argument that this public principle, as it is, continues to continue publicly.
Others have paid extra place as a shelter – a practical unchanged splitter of the city that should be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who includes the blog named "Jeremiahs dismissed New York" (subscribed with "The Book of the Acts: A bitter nostalgic view on the external city"), published a part of the conversation of the city story about Extra Place, which appeared in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author Brendan Gill at the same time wrote: "Extra Place is a small small sackgasse that remains even day over the dark and is marked by the ruined metal tours of the campaigns, closed windows and on the railways. "
With few exceptions, the road has looked so shortly at one evening.
A rat walked through the back side of the street, not far away from the door that previously leaded to the CBGB, where today there is a more swimming clothes.
Graffiti had seen on the walls and a empty bier flat laid on the ground, not far far from a fresh boundal of earned newspapers.
Some passports said they wouldn't have seen some of the extra place, but they suggested that the road could be relaxed.
Fields added that, according to his view, some people estimated the road journey in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, female and slightly.
Debates on double language education: English education
In this exhibition of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates to double language training.
Lance T. Izumi, leading scientific workers in Kalifionian studies and leaders in the School Education Sciences at the Pacific Research Institute Institute for Public Policy, is a composer of the book "It's not so good as you think: Why the medium class needs a selection".
The Spanish elector is a complex task.
Barrack Obamas proposals on education are a typical example for this.
Obamas elector campaign mentioned that "the probability of Afrikan American and Spanish students to complete their schools successfully is lower than in white students" - what is right.
In order to close this performance distance, Obamas Education Plan recommends specifically a double language transitional phase in training for those who first learn English.
However, the question of Obama is whether its use for twice language training, which teaches the difficulty to learn in other languages as English, against his interest to reduce the distance in school services.
Let's take for example "Sixth Street Prep", a basic school in East Los Angeles.
Most students are Spanish and come from families with low income.
More than a third of the students, of which many are soon in the country, learn English.
However, in 2008, 100 percent of students in the fourth class have been checked in Mathe at a good level.
In the case of surprise, 93 per cent of children from the fourth school year in the English audit were well evaluated.
This magnificent success has been achieved with other methods than those of Obama.
The school Sixth Street sets its difficulty on checking and delivery, on steadily controls of knowledge and stops that does not tolerate exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practices the approach to training in an English environment. This is the point that Obama has to be seen, the Leader of Linda Mikels.
This approximation sets the value to the almost extraordinary use of the English language in the Facility.
Mrs. Mikels, who refused the idea of double language training, said to me that the school would have a significant success with a school who has come from Mexico shortly. 12 months later, they would be able to take the classroom and could not recognize him again.
"It's working," she remarked, " it's working for us."
Will Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large part of Latin American and other English students?
The performance of the school would easily make the answer to this question, but the training policy positions within its own party (the national image agreements are supported for a long time by the idea of double language training) and its own successive support for the double language training to prevent Obamas' response.
During the point that immigrants should learn English, he was to trivialize the theme shortly while he noted that people should stop, worried about the objective legislature of the "Nor English".
Instead, he said, "You have to make sure your child can Spanish."
If Obama actually wants to close the performance distance, he should take carefully into account the models of education which function, instead of avoiding and trivialising it.
Oil prices resulting from the re-employment of the economy
The land oil price is Monday because of the fears that even the American Saving Plan for Finance Market could not be renewed by the economy.
In the New York trade offices, 7 per cent of $99.80 per barriers were made in the provisional session.
Since last Monday the price was shot over $20.
In the past two weeks, the goods markets have been destroyed both from the financial tourbs on the Wall Street and also from strong active gates in Mexico's golf.
After the prices reached their height of $145,29 per barrel in July, they were almost $90 per barrel in this month, so that, as a result of the huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors have re-employed themselves, although they had announced Congress advertisers, they would have joined themselves to a rescue plan that should be the greatest in the history.
This message was overwhelmed by new concerns that the financial crisis was not yet closed.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, a government communication on Monday should buy the Citigroup banks of the Wachovia Corporation.
Interimly, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg Governments have participated in the European Finance Consident Fortis.
Following analysis at Barclay's Capital, although the negotiations held in the last week and have been conducted to a rescue plan, it seems to be not easily able to deal with the markets.
Since the economic situation is further damaging, it is expected that the demand for goods, among others to oil, will continue to sink.
Analysts of the German Bank have written in a communication to investors who have become uncertainable for global capital markets, rates and foreign currencies.
We believe it will continue to write them that the good markets will also be affected.
"We are most concerned about whether the US Virus spreads a worldwide, especially in China."
The analysis of the Bank has corrected their expectations for oil consumption because of the weighty economic growth for the coming year, and their prognoses for oil and gas prices were 20% for 2009.

"I've never seen anything like that," said Eliss.
After a smooth game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which spoke to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass at Lavernue Coles for a 12-Yard Touchdown, it marked the perfect upgrade to a afternoon day in which their development cooperation was developed.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for other two touchdowns, one time as a defender, and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half time.
"I have not particularly stressed," Coles said about the pools that went to Coles.
He's a super player.
Our vote has decided, nothing that people think."
During Favre and Coles Fangen, the defence of Quarterback Kurt Warner took one another.
External Defensive Darrelle Revision started a hurt and transformed it into a 32-yeard touchdown.
Freeo Erik Smith came to another step and started away.
The lineebacker David Bowens then provided for a loss of warner.
The last ball lost, disappeared at Bowens, probably was the most depressed.
The Cardinal had the ball with more than 10 seconds in the game when the Jets returned the ballo and Jay Feely turned a 20 Yard Schuss to 34 to 0 guide.
These were the most points that the Jets had ever found in a quarter.
When he asked to describe the wrestine, he answered Erik Mangini, the coach of Jets "The second quarter or the third?"
In response both, because the Jets left 21 points in the third quarter without one one, said Mangini, "Create me, I have taken the second quarter more than the third.
Many points have been achieved in short-term."
Deteriorate Geneslassy kills his World Record
Haile Gebrselassy from Ethiopia has revealed why some of them keep him for the best long-term producers of all time after he breaked his own record in Berlin's Marathon on Sunday and became the first person who made the streets of 42.2 km in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flow curses in 2:03:59, we improved his previous result of 2:04:26 to 27 seconds that he reached in Berlin last year.
This is why his 26th World Record has found in his multi-party carrier, in which he has at every street of a kilometre to Marathon at least reached a world-mastership title or a world record.
Last month, Gebrselassy left the olympic marathon in Beijing, because of fear that it might have been overcome in the afternoon that the air threat could disappear asthma problems.
Instead, he informed himself for the Wetthop in Berlin.
In almost ideal circumstances - at the starting and 13 degrees of the start- and start-- has gained census with a average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per miles.
Since trainers such as Gebercelassy and Paul Tergat have changed from Kenya to long streets, the time of recording for Marathon in the last 10 years has been caught over 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin, with the results 2:06:05.
After his winter on Sunday, he shared the Birthlassy, he would have lived two weeks ago warms in his Wade and so he could not train a week.
Apparently, he was disappeared and not backed.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"All's perfectly running.
I took the training again a week ago, and I had still some concerns today, but at the end, what's pretty much."
He was critical to this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia Rivals from Osta Africa - that he is overly orchestrated to his rectangles, a lot of the world's marathonstars generally prevented themselves to the renaissators, as if it be a train railway, and the world records on the Wettmaker.
However, this criteria does not affect the size of the ceiling axis as long-term vendors.
Along with four Kenians on Sunday, we had reached the middle of the streets at 1:02:04.
Two Electrics from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to ask birthers after they had requested the timemasters.
Some more than three miles before the finish has made his last approach to separate himself from Kwambai, who came as the second in 2:05:36 and has improved his best time for almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi was Dritter in 2:07:48.
In women Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kasachstan and now German, has completed a significant year by showing the most 7th result of all times.
The World Record of 2:15:25 is Paul Radcliff from the British.
In the last summer, the 36 years old Mikitko was surprising London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems that have been described as a back-related crime. Everyone has been able to win in Berlin and to improve its best time in her third marathon for five minutes.
She has planned her course, allowing a quarter of an atmosphere and kainic drivers first, but after 30 kilometers she was transferred.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop came from Kenya as a third in 2:25:01.
The sovereignty and the strips in the life of the black population, in a city of the very special kind
Hide between the outcomes of the free time parks in Orlando, a few miles away from the glitzer, slow and green beachs, is a quiet city where the Stolz and the complications of the Afro-American culture comes.
Eatonville, the first black city in the country and the hometown Zora Neale Hurstons, is not more easy to describe as Hurston it was in 1935: "The city with 5 Seas, three cockpits, 300 brain hairs, 300 good beds, more than enough guests, 2 schools and no prison."
Today, it's a pilgrim station.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are coming to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
However, it is and remains the city that it described – and which she made it to a tourist ground by taking it into the Florida travel manager, which has been produced at the time of the depression of the federalist project – in many regards of a place of the entire special order.
Eatonville is so independent, ridiculous and private as in the 1930s, as Hurston wrote, that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the knowing man who "such little know about us that he doesn't know what it's going to do."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidency canades, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation on races relations, many of them continue to be observed by expenses.
"We are very concerned about our story," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and municipality member of the elderly church of the city.
It must vote."
Eatonville has long been defined as the Paradox of the Triumphes and the fight.
It is a historic example of the black movement and a municipality of almost 2.400 inhabitants, where the poverty currency is both high as the country average.
On the one hand, it is a highburg of literature, and on the other hand, a example of the - sometimes - pregnant - black culture of the South South, which has their roots in the American Slavery.
It is not surprised that the inhabitants here are so hot as well as the hair.
And so right began the fears about Eatonville's image actually with Zora, as all the Hurston named here.
She made the world her hometown in books who came from heart and were written in the mouth, as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five sections in the Florence Travel Manager changed the city, which is close to the red 77, a road that leads through the center of Florida, to the views of black history and human drama.
Fish and Oscar in real life as well as in literature, Hurston readers led to load Eatonville's first citizen manager, Joe Clarke, and then turned private matters.
"Apart from the road to the left," she wrote, "the braun - showing modern school, with her planted gardens and players, which always cares for Howard Miller, although he can little read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "Glenns of all kinds of sale and some-hour-times to hour rooms."
In only a few hundred words Hurston then, Eatonville was connected with self-register, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
This wasn't all sure the travel manager.
In fact, it was not a portrait that was estimated by all.
"Shore described the things as they were," said Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson girls, refusing the Hurton, drew the men who sing their beauty, who were full of sexual plays.
She added, "Mann people don't like this."
You still remember Hurtson as a vital excentricist who returned regularly after her family was moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston was used to the town, she mostly did it without warning, in a smooth chevrolet, smoking and attended with hoses, in a city that was invented something on her early clothing style today.
According to Mr Franklin, most inhabitants were fascised, where many of them were denied.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "It never remained too long," he added while he looked at his throne, on a landscape seen after the Sabelia Sea, when he was baptized by the Hurston of all likely likely.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and decreed her books.
Together with the large part of the world, Eatonville seemed to forget them.
Although she was one famous author, a newspaper Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there were no great memorandums, no public readings in the largest style.
"I don't think they have understood their contribution in the world or heritage in the lowestest," Valerie Boyd, author of "Wraped in Rainbows," a biography on Hurston was published in 2003.
The wheel came in the 80s.
Orange County Authorities wanted to put a five-to-pured car trail through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slowly two-soft corners of the community.
Orlandos Vorortes had already shot the fourth town railway through the west border.
The proposal was extended as Eatonville has still been a difficult stage in his story.
Integration, among others, had ended the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 50s of the fight against races injured to the Community.
"In that time, a call of white boys came and they were crying horns and added to the absolutely sitting people," said Mr. Franklin.
"It was even a woman who had been killed.
They're throwing a mile of water out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel requested the Chief Court of Justice to reintegrate its decision in the case of Brown against the School as "political instead of my race".
Inhabitants say this day that even though the rise of racists in some views was positive that the groups of meetings in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of its youth.
"Now children were usually used to be dismayed - I remember - you've turned up his teacher the morning and turned his teacher at night," N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and colleagued Director of the Common Group on the Protection of the Eatonville Community.
This could be resolved so long, she added until teachers and teachers had no longer come out of the same place.
"He didn't cut his white teacher because he was a white teacher -- I mean there is a cultural climate," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, the citizens' rights have made a place for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, players and artists who moved on advantages, as she did, with a positive self-consciousness and comments like: "Who can somebody refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writers Alice Walker moved on the way to Hurston's unnamed grave and began to fight again for the rehabilitation of her calm.
Five years later, it was found a very pleasant Hurston-Bigraphy of Robert E. Hemenway in the book regulations and made it again to a part of the American literature canons.
The television project came exactly at a time when the Eatonville's famous daughter was once again in the light of the public.
And this time, Hurton's old neighbors saw them as a retreat.
The municipality began in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston festival to show what can be destroyed by the building of the carway.
thousands of Fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many returned for the feast.
A few years later, the beach turned from his road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-profit television roads lived the city, accelerated the whole with speed speed, hiding the real citizen's stage," said Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd pressed it something more easier: "The time Eatonville was saved."
The victory against the television project has contributed to a change of the self-aspect of the city.
There came more and more advertisers, such as Rachelle Munson, an avvocate who goes into the church since 1993, and homes began to reappear the past.
Eatonville was included in the country's historic registry.
A new original library ( naturally named by Hurston) opened on the newly recent and corrupted Kennedy Boulevard in 2006.
Today, Eatonville has a speciality in Florida: just 6 miles from the city centre of Orlandos, it can feel sometimes like a fall in the summer race, just small as it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It's too much 90% black today.)
External search for the history of Eatonville and its importance is often being treated with attention.
For most interviews, it is necessary for a approval in front and some things - such as the change of Eatonville's older church, which has been painted by a wise, and the black men in the field work can not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a mechanical and self-conscious teacher with a pretence for the dark road, still fear that their misconscious community will be understood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston festival was increased, a higher degree of home steel was also born.
In particular, young people are nerved to see Eatonville as Hurston saw all her race: great, with all its problems, or worse or worse, and exactly delicate, creative and pleasant, alright and missed as every other race and people in America.
It's the earliest love to this city that you can hear in Mr. Franklins Neffen, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who would like to return to the colleague to Eatonville, to work in the city manager or police, which could use him some help.
And even the disciples, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old favors from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville right.
"The most people who walk here will think: "Ah, this city is nothing compared to all the other," said Alondra Kenon at a Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and see his story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, we're talking about a final financial policy.
The first view has nothing changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were disappeared from the newspapers and the forced television screens in the Times Square, they would not know that they were in the middle of a debakel.
They would never believe that their heads, in the guest offices with the glass, bankers and hedge funders who have the Monopol in New York, have the worst working day since 1929.
The providers are still swimming with slow clothes the metall teaws over along citizen and promoting tablets that are loaded with Muffins for the dinner sessions.
The Latinos still screw between apartments, such as human packages loaded with the 50 shirts fixed, which are on one of their schools.
Official providers are still waiting for food living on their breakfast and it is still unable to get a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 hours.
There was no feelings like a crisis until I decided to open a new sparton on Thursday on Thursday because of all the world's transition interests.
Although I had decided to put my obligation at the quiet afternoon afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase stamm film, about 20 people were locking.
Not to the money samples to cut money or to pay, but to the customer service shop where the shopping shot books are ordered, to ask tourists after the way to buy Macy's house and to open new customer accounts.
Most before me, I learned later from Starr, my "perspective bank officers with license", standing out of the same reason as I lock.
However, in contrast to me, they had already disappeared their parts from smaller banks, in places from where they were hungry, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Iceland.
They had the money of that named Tririfts (a little one of the construction parks likend), common coastal banks and local spacees that only have in a State of Philippines and say they were treating their customers as a family.
In the last 15th year, these banks were still and leise Pleite went.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with installations at $327 billion, in concursive management over and as leader Friday New Yorker over the weekend to the home, was Wachovia, another bank, which has spanish plants in the value of $440 billion, looking for a free buyer.
In the fear of another entry, the officers and load officers brought their bars before me to a bank which will be seen as a secure port, a bank responsible for most rescue purchases at the Wall Street.
In the past few weeks, New Yorkers have been engaged.
A woman who called in my Chinese tribe oversight market, took so much confidential relations to Lehman Brothers, the Pleite Bank, and her opposed presidency Dick Fuld, as she would smile over a fault colleague.
And Lyn, which is the 50-year-old concierge of my housing blow, has come from our usual conversation theme on Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I've now told all my finances in the money market", she told me after my visit at the Bank.
"I'm changed, I'm not going to risk anymore."
Muslimal greenhouses during the court in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a Leader of the Austrian Free Party of Austria, and Philip Deventer, member of the Belgian Pertei Vlaams Belong, take part in a demonstration in attractions to the organization "States against Islamization".
They take shelters in the style of transport signs on which a mocket is formed, translated with a red line.

A speaker of the local islamic community said to be "est deeply disappointed" about the message of the grab decreased as the religious month of the Muslim Raman end.
At the same time in Austria, a round skill research has been made after the country in the election of Parliament on the right.
The FPE and the Alliance for the future of Austria, which two far-related parties arrived far from nearly 30% of the votes, introduced in their election camp for a rigorous anti-inmigrant law, and some of their elections were criticised by the guests.

Foreign Price for Gary Glitter

The judges introduced a six-monthium Sperre after he informed his controlling authorities, he wanted to travel through France to Spain.
The police in Kent was granted last Thursday to engage for a foreign journey after she presented the judge test for the prejudices of Letter because of the sexual abuse of children.

'I accept the master behind the hook to hold his character,' Günter Brauer, photograph.
No items, no rocks, no costals for the attack.
The nature of the large flamenco-containers that respect the concentration and extend the interpretation to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or a man.
One side artist
Other sides of personality
I look in private life, in these moments that are strange for the public, I know when I can find the standard guests for personality, the thresholds of a stolen look or expression of the hands that are concerned because they are not in the buckets.
In his project `Flamenco-people', the German photograph Günter Bauer's changing theatralics of some inscensions on the beach with singener, tancer and gardenists. From this side he was noted for the artists.
With this proposal, the photograph will create a special icon graph of flamencodivision at different levels.
The exhibition, listed to the program of the photography of the Flamenco, reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is always greater than the day to day, explains the artist and makes it clear that 'Flamenco-people' can be the favorite person, but if you look at the photos, the viewer notes that there are no typical images of artists on the ground.
The whole normal people on the portrait are artists who are in the situation on the sweetness of suffering, tragicity, joy, and to move the public.
In order to hold the personality of these artists, you don't have to make photos on the bottle.
Your personality and their character is in their hearts.
What I was interested to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to hold the characters of the greatest flamenca committees.'
Bauer, inspired by Festival `Cante de la Minas', made a long journey in 1997 to photonize Sänger, Gitarists or Tanner with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image location function of the camera and the existing material, recorded images in classic photography.
The application of different styleist resources destroys the classic basis of the image, with which the image is modern and the idea, as the Bauer Flamenco understands, will be lost: 'Music with traditional wheels that changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only the tank, the speech or the instrumental game on themselves, but the personality of the artist, his character, which produces the public with his art.
The search for the essential, after a certain Ethiopia, which will be seen in the form of the hearing of his body, is and was the fitting goal of this work represented in the next time in the galerie of El Fotómata.
Acknowledge personalities in Flamenco among them, Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canals, Vicente Amigo and others are the choice of almost seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project was made to anthology of the flamenco and is soon as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauers suffering to the portrait has led him to take this idea two years ago and to realize as 'portART project'.
Although the concept of the project `Flamenco-people' is different, the photograph is very pleased to photograph people to know them and put me into life, whether it's for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult gap.
You can't trick you or push people, personalities that you don't know anytime, or they let you just a couple minutes to make a photo.
Besides these circumstances when photograph I'm always trying to realize my ideas."
The collection of the portraits of the flamenco of today with the title "Flamenco-people" is presented in the gallerie of El Fotómata, which is on the street with the name the calle de la Mata and is parallel to the road la Alameda de Hercules. You can visit until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa believes that the Roman, which he just writes, is a Tolquity.
He still doesn't know where the work of the Roman and what it's about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is trying to make the project in which he was just working before, a Roman with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist of Ireland who lived for twenty years in the Congo and went in the Amazon Territory.
Yesterday, while his presence on Festival there Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Price manager gave that the project with which he occupies himself is 'one tolerance' and 'all states that he should not write the Roman.'
'If I would be aware, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and hope that when the Roman ends, he decided to take part in the festival where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. In the four days he had hundreds of writers, stories, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La city les perros' was one of the most excellent personalities on the third Festival and made prognoses.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Premium of Festival Hay Festival and the most of the presents, will be compared with the old output of 'Our mutual friend' and is to see in the Theater John Bravo.
He was presented by Félix Romeo and found that he had a public before himself, which noted that the Peruan, who had a wonderful memory and a great humor feeling, was not given sufficient time to be able to take all the time: how his vocational vocation to literature, which was issued from the 'external deficiency', from 'Freude on reading' and from `more want to experience, as it comes before'; how he writes and 'Disziplin' to add the mangel of inspiration, his intensive work with documentation, numerous corritories and revisions, which were made; how the Facultors, Víctor Huszipin and his professionals, and which are the most inspiration of his history.
The Spanish American Roman writer found that there is no way to measure and how to know whether books can change life, 'or I refuse to believe that the literature is pure conversation, a funny experience, a warm experience, the Vargas Llosa, who claims that they are calling 'effects' and 'The people bring more from each other', therefore I urge the writers' and 'the response for his vocational vocation'.
During the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather didn't play with: Stier campaigns fell partly.
After which the announced warriors found that the ground of the place was in bad state, the Stier campaign was completed with the festival in Pozoblanco tomorrow.
Thus the Institute decided to move the story campaign of Fermín Bohórquez, Paul Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández.
Thus, the festival of the unexpert Witness was made, so two of the three feasts could not be held.
On Saturday it was not possible to fill the second seat campaign provided.
The Matore group was of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and John Bautista, who followed the Stier Campfarena.
So there was only a feast on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who was triumphed and triumphed after he left the transition with pleasure and joy.
At the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the stairs, which was more pleased to him by galopards than by his stier chapter.
And even worse was El Juli, who went through the Arena de Los Bauos without difficulty, but also without quietness.
After he did so bad, a majority of the public reacted at his second fight with buh calls.
In Alava, two people wanted to control their wagon, who had been loaded with two thousand kilo Hashish.
Morning: 5 minutes ago 10 minutes.
Transport controls in Ertzaintza, in the city of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers requested the car drivers to stop, where they were flighted.
It looked like it should not stop with the load of more than two thousand kilo hashish.
The police followed them and took one of the leaders who was 28 years old known as A. A. J., as it shared the Internal Minister of the Bank State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trade and of official documents.
In the case of the case, the officers of the Álava region had already concluded the controls of transport on the N-1 and passed through the town of Armenia.
They decided to keep a car to carry out the red controls. The driver had not followed the instructions, immediately increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
Policians began the persecution until the car arrived in a few kilometres on the border. At the same time, the drivers went out of the car to flee over a landstraße in a forest area.
The police of Ertza has finally introduced one of the sides. In the car, a Iveco Daily, the drug drugs transported 2.178 Kilo Hashish who was advised by the police.
The previous part of the car was loaded with a hash-bitol, which later were led to precise labor analysis and to the shipment of the bonds to other police offices.
In addition, the officers found that the character was 'dubbet', so it did not agree to the character set out in the Kfz packages, therefore further a determination of official documents was carried out.
The police of the city of Ertza continues to provide the arrest of the second suspect, which, as mentioned, could flee, but also to determine the origin of the invoiced drugs.
The 28-year-old A. A. J., was sent to a police office, and he is submitted to the Court in the next hours.
Heather Locklear player were determined because of the trip under the effect of an unknown medicine.
The player Heather Locklear, known by the role of the Amanda in the series "Melrose Place", was found in this weekend in Santa Barbara (Kalifornia) because of the travel under an unknown medicine.
A witness has observed how she had tried to get out of her park lens in Montecito, reported the transport policies of California to the Magazin People.
The Witness told the details that Locklear had pressed the Gaspedal after 16:30 p.m. and made a lot of laughing when she tried to move her car down or forward from the parking clash, and when she went back, she had turned some times on her sunflow.'
Something later, the witness that the player had probably not recognized that Locklear had arrived on a near road and grew up the car.
The testimony was the person who reported the emergency because she had 'angth for Locklears'.
When the police officers came, they found the player sitting in their car, which was carefully standing on the road and then blocked the transport.
'There seemed to be without orientation', so they brought the policeers into a special drug and alcohol centre to make a test.
According to a police speaker, the player had been cooperative, extraordinary alcoholus was excluded from the first moment. 'The first observations of the officers in consequence, we believe Locklear stands under the influence of a unknown medicine, so the speaker.'
Locklear was defended to take effect in the influence of an undetermined substance that could not be determined and brought into a local investigation against 19 hours.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the clinic in Arizona where it was treated against fears and depressions.
Llamazares is that the Enthusic Union of the United States is responsible for the case of Silva.
Gaspar Llamazares, the Chief Coordinator of the VL and Deputy of the United Nations Links, has stated today that the Regional Trade for Education would be those who will be the decision in the case of the former city Council for youth and the Sport of the Council in Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, which was returned last week after he was accused to make business with family members.
"In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the enthusiastic organization will be the one who has to take the competence for it, Callares, which is to be the proper way of the party, which is to be in the city Council of Sevilla.
Nevertheless, the President of the VL defended the need for the 'Transparence' in the possible investigations of the regulations that silva could have started: 'The VL has always been able to receive the maximum transparency of these cases.'
With regard to this subject, he stressed that education has a closer ethnic code for all public emers.
`Sangre de May : Helden Book of Garci
Inspirated by `Episodios Nationales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de Mayo' makes the transformed version of the famous rebels of Spanish to the French. This is a wonderful film in the filmgraphy, with about 15 million euros' investment for drug workers.
In this way, the Cineast tried to show a number of personalities and social analysis, what he always wondered at the works of the famous Roman writer, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Goodiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long directory of the producers.
'Sangre de Mayo' with a film length of more than two hours, this Friday will be presented in Kinos and then showed on the sender telemad as a four-year-old ministry.
José Luis Garci, the great fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that this dream work was "Cindity Space" in fulfillment. This was to thank Esperanza Aguirre, which hired him three years ago by the autonom community of Madrid to refer a film to the second century in Madrid. In particular, because the story was based on the basis of 'Episodios Nationales', he took the order.
The total amount of 15 million made by the autonomy Community Madrid for railworks offers Garci, as he added, the 'one possibility' with the help of decorations and the corresponding expectations, the image of the 'consolided Spain', which was requested by the false manager for the fight, because the people had been drawn back by the fight for independence and under the government of the VII.
However, the Cineast is that you could not calculate with the financing, such as with 'Alatriste' or 'Los fantasmas de Goya' (that high as with the 'Sangre de Mayo'), so some scenes could not be working with Horacio Valcárcel, with the Garci almost all its carriers.
For this reason, Garci, who also was a film director in `Volver a empezar', has been involved by his usual work: he sets himself on the screens with which you should first try before the starting and for those who did not make casiting, he appeared that he had 'ententend' and respect, is a part of the professional of the film director in order to provide help in the theatre and kine to know what in the Kino industry is working.'
Many producers on which he dreams in 'Sangre de Mayo' have to recover before his camera, such as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guilen Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar-Kandidat in four nominations (of which he has obtained one), is the view and assured that no of the three candidates presented in this year before the Academy of Hollywood represents a young generation of Spanish filmografie. We will be 'Sangre de Mayo', nor `Siete mesas de Billar', and finally not the selected film 'Los rondasoles ciegos'.
Garci is not waiting for this movie.
'To begin you think you're working for the birth, later you know that it's only for disappointment, and now you're satisfied if you've still produced a movie," Garci explains more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón calls the memory to the Tanzers from Sevilla Tórtola Valencia
A flamencocontainer of Sevilla makes a dancer, who is also departing from Sevilla.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: Her father was Katalane (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusierin (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the quarter of Triana and when she was three years old, her family was dead to London.
She was a dancer and an expert for East Things.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first warrants for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist, Vegetarian, and seemed to take the corte, which limited the free female movement.
The life of this woman who left her legs at the Tanz and Ethic Revolution in Europe during the time between the wars, Isabel Bayón has been fascily affected.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and she proposed this role that I couldn't appear."
'We don't try to tell her life or to keep their spirit,' said the Flamencontainer.
Your tank bases helped me in Flamenco.
'The Tanz of Schmetterlings' came to me for example, like Guajira, or ' the Tanz of the Schlange' like Tango.
Her dance was reasonable, and I was told that my tanks are also located in this ästhetic area, it claims.
The inscribing is with two extraordinary cooperations: with Miguel Poveda, which will be sing for Isabel at one of its ideas, as he also did in 'La door open'; and with Flamenco Matilde Coral minister who wanted to work together with one of its former schools.
"Matilde plays Tórtola, a very rid of personality.
I'm glad because they were understood to cooperate in my work, and I feel very appreciated.'
The institution also comes with the musical composition and the Gitarist Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the mixture of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the persequence of El Pajaro, and the Viola of Rafa el Viola and the cooperation with the player Johnfra Júarez, he takes the role of the artists who were divas, in which he always loved himself.'
In this case, there is also a certain way of life of this woman, which was known in far-related places such as India, the United States or Russia and also in all Europe, although she usually lived in London.
'I wanted to call them back to remembrance, because I think she is one of the women who have a huge impact on a certain epoca and whose works today are no longer and that is less knowing."
The presentation will take place today at 20:30 in the Theater Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book 'Diario of a poeta reciprocal housedo' also concludes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated outputs from `Diario de un poeta homedo' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at a place where John Ramón Jiménez 1916 Zenobia has been married, offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out the active activities planned in the order of the Catalian Council for Cultural Cultural, to celebrate the Trinium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). This objective is the memory of the fifteenth July of the Literatural Prize and the death of the two.
Thus, the Triennium of Zenobia and John Ramón' will be concluded with the new exhibition of this works, with the international congress held in New York, with the restoration of the housemuseum of John Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and the Wanderousisation `Juan Ramón Jimenez: 'Aquel chopo de light' which was opened in May and after she was present in different places in Andalus, now reached New York and presented in the history of the International Congressis.
The Catalonian Council for Cultural culture also has received eight hundred Exhibitors from `Diario de un poeta recocién housedo' issued by Pedro Tabernero and have been illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The purpose is to make the person and the work of the autumnic world distortion.
The U.S. can present bad without Paul Newman
'Manchmal creates God perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This term consists of the player Sally Field, who cooperated with him in 'Sensation Reportrin', and of the form of the US-American Kinos, which was left in the style, came from all America to Newman with his warranted idea and followed her.
Now look what she costs to give him Oscar.
And when he returned in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, this was a great gun for all.
'What sometimes feels, it's significantly more than one expression, and now I've lost a great friend' said Robert Redford weeping,' my life and my country were the greatest delicateness of his life.'
No one was afraid to make a liar or to translate.
As a 'Vater' of the Kinos and the country of the father was died in a terrible moment, in the fear of terrorists and before the market coast, where the self-valued feelings of the US Americas is in the search for reasons for retaining the fairness.
If in this hard time without a doubt only few people you can wonder, you must not indeed be Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he formed almost a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was official enemy by Richard Nixon, and was endangered as different losses as well as wines: from the building which structured to the fight against drugs and on the honor of his son of the first marriage died to overdosis was founded up to the own brand and organic products.
All this is a gift for the country in which it costed a lot of courage to take place against a mortal food culture.
A wide wage of the surprise suggests that hence over Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man died but all the medicine.
The England Sam Mendes, the film director and the Oscar Price manager said that the work with Newman was not more or less than the tickets of his carrier.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy who came from Australia, urged to describe Newman as his greatest inspiration.
'On the Great has left all of us', confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who have tried to live today as Paul Newman lived: high requirements of law, a responsibilities, a private life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in this media school.
But there are some who tried it, and Paul Newman was an example of this.
He left to divorce one time and then was married with Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although there were certainly many opportunities to be.
'What should I eat a Hamburger on the street when I got home films?' he spent often.
In the sky, he will be boasting that his daughters have the same view as his fans, what is not usually usually in America.
'To all the great roles he played, he was not so boasting as the faithful marriage, the loving father, the notice Opas and the Philanothrops, they say.'
For the Olympic games, the roads in Madrid are missing.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to create some olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the winter for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask: 'We prepared for it?'
Yeah, we follow the example of the old roads, I say it's not true!
She was called as an perfect road, and after my review, she was the worst road with all the way and dran there.
Of course, this is a lot of inconsistents if you see the evaluation and I could check it, what would not be clearly done.
But, we're going to go through everything from the beginning.
The mosa starts with the tickets that allows you to go as first.
It doesn't seem bad to me, but if they are going to get you, they should also give you everything (including chip to avoid the steel on the road).
So not.
Here they can only take you the ticket (the first unsin that is to go out there) and (after an unexpected warning) there is the surprise! The T-Shirt had only in the size 'S' (a second unsin because I need the XL size)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis it has been decided to buy a lot of lower meats from less substances?
So good, things like these are a smallness compared to the days on the street.
Notwithstanding that you need to go very early to take the chip, there is already a warning length of at least 15 minutes, and, in addition, the rucksack must be laid down.
The expectation has held more than 35 minutes, which is in the case of a road, where 11,000 people are waiting, is irreprensible.
Finally, as it was to wait, we started the road and we hadn't laid our backsheets before, even if it had been possible, but they would be more difficult.
Moreover, it appeared that in these 40 minutes awaiting rain, so it came to attempt to organize a people's distance and to overcome the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people of lungs use and some of the way I'm going to get about this chip that I have received, not even in time at the classification, I can't think that the output has been wrongly disappeared.
Of course, if you would ask me a perfect road, this road would never fall me.
So I think we'll be dreaming a city that is well prepared for the Olympian games
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) Receptionistin
On the 'Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image recognition system and the human interaction, a way of the artistic intelligence without much intelligence that is able to perform some priority tasks such as a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, it is a red planet to move on the campus of the company). The system observes what it hears during the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a form recognition system, this can recognize how many people are in the room and even remember how they were expecting to hear it and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also attend the attendants after the discussions in the groups.
In the presentationvide, the Receptionistin notes a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group that leads to her conversation and is not a company representative.
She wonders whether the person wants to visit someone here and answers that it will soon be listened.
All without blue screenshot
Printing
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things on which it can focus, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week, it was very obvious about the Microsoft strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computer had been equipped with the most needed, instead of fitting it with the commercial mull, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that's only for the conditions.
All is only a set if you think Microsoft is added one or another function and 'Extras' in Windows.
The direction changes
The Microsoft has right, the operating system is often lost an importance, just as the software.
When Google Chrom appeared in the network, it was a part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to competite with Windows.
Many have shown that the browser is not an operational system.
The operating system, as an unsearchable part, will always be necessary to enable equipment and software to operate simultaneously.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his marriage or marriage, if it is going to share something of his wedding.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you must think about his 'Tod', not as an absolute, but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People are more attention to the operating system, more than the web browser.
The computer is only starting to execute the Firefox, view or chrom and take more time every day on the top than in the `Folder' environment.
For what is the half of existing applications in the computer?
Mine is more
And Windows 7 must be complicated, much more complex than view.
It's easier, not translated, less complex.
The interest of Microsofts is more to integrate its online services that will finally be able to be the alternative to Google.
In fact, they need this, without doubt, I bring a small example of this.
The photo of this place I made in Redmond, in one of the reception rooms for Microsoft's officers at the beginning of the month.
A screen is a screen: `Your search. Our future'. It is pleased to use your online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study was concluded that 66% of the officers in Microsoft, Google used for research in the network.
By the last week, the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also confirmed in the delay.
It will not appear at the beginning, but the end of 2009, even before 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility of bringing Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time to the brand.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
Android and iPhon are already on the market, but the other extension will cost money.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Paul Picasso was located in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just as Al Pacino in 'The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it is about waiting for a goodly built parers.
If we start to tell the unnumerable star attitudes, we can return to the image of a very strong man, with a spring bar that had high weight in a Wander circle.
In the reason, this is a typical male T-shirt of trees, mixed and tailed.
The English languages call it "tank". However, it translates all the other brands.
First, because of his great name, even though it is called in the corner round `Marcel'. The ready tells that the name's enlargement is connected with sports and the Boxer Marcel Cerdan, the favorite of Sänger Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' translates all because of its excellent tree wool, because of its different Unisex-Snitters and is a small Belgian fashion (see acknowledged) that these T-shirts have a detail on the Half.
And respect, the Belgian company focuses not only on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Kaschmire, Hooks from trees, T-Shirts with strifes, babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and designed subheadings.
Although it is very dangerous to use it as a clothing.
You're very grateful.
'I want to be a young mother; for the candidate I don't worry.'
Her great attraction with her sister was not encouraged to develop her own personality.
Monica Cruz is sick but full of life.
The Masters are currently taking their new activity in the mode very serious.
For Monica, this means significantly more than some beautiful and rich meals that keep their call.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, where she has been presenting the most important premiums in the mode that expresses the Spanish modern house.
Happy and crazy, winner on the short streets.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this Herbst/Winter Saison, which my sister Penelope and I have designed for Mango, and I also visited the presenting of the second exhibition of Mango Fashion Awards and participated in the dinner of Valentinos.
A very intensive working time that is at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the foundation of your new collection for the fourth Saison for Mango?
My sister, as well as I'm in the knee of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I'm going through a city and watching women as they're involved, as they're combining their clothes, I'm often doing it.
Twizerin, player and modern linger, you're a very many-social woman, right?
I believe yes, but finally, everything happens in one and these areas have many communities.
Since I was small, I was clothed by clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to go around into my clothes of clothes and see their clothes.
It was super, white better than go to a free time park.
It's too late, as a twinner, I always tried to look at the waiting.
You know, we dancers are so much like to learn our own style in education and in the tests to look in the speed and feel well about it.
As a player, when you get the coast, you're turned to the real producer role.
Finally, everything is linked to each other, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionality.
You've been 30 years ago, you've been in no crises?
Oh, that's it.
I feel better than you, and I feel good.
I find that the woman's going to be riddle, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I have no fear for my biological hour.
I've done the things I'd already wanted to do since I've been small, and it has given me a lot of joy inside.
So you think you're gonna be mother, or not?
Since a long time, I know I'm gonna be mother, because it requires my body, and also I want to be a young mother; I don't want to leave it.
What about the candidat, I don't worry about.
I'll send my child great happiness and get it with a lot of love.
What's about the movie art, you're keeping the work you've participated and the last year crashed.
That's the same, and I am very pleased that they should be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, am very unbelievable and unbelievable and wants to have everything at once that can't be immediately.
I would very want that 'the last hour' and 'En seeking the tomb of Christ' for the first time.
See how they like you
A couple days ago, you appeared on the course with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not so that I went on the course to model.
Naomi Campbell, which I know for some time, has just called me to London to be invited to a parade for the welfare of her organization 'Frauen for a better world' and the clothing we show to participate. I know that two clothes of clothes were hidden from our collection for Mango to collect money for Naomi NGOs.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
It's a lot of things about her, and I, as the one she knows, would tell you that they don't vote.
However, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this great thing, but when she comes and asks me to make me a hand, I will do this.
To support women in the third world, whatever it is necessary.
The cars that can be reflected by the alcohol level will need to install the 'Alcolock'.
The Authority assigned that the driver who had three official crimes because of the alcool level is installed in his car of this system, which offers him to start the car in the furnished state. If he is alcoholized, then it doesn't open the car.
The initiative has already been announced in the last month in June and now is a part of the report of the General Administrative Board, and it is a pilot project that will be a year long.
The purpose is to resolve the driver, so that it is a course for the reduction of the traffic retention.
In addition to the General State Administration, investigations will also participate in the ministry of transport and the establishment of the Technical Safety Institute of Autos.
According to statistics, between 30-75 % of the car vehicles, which have been shown more than one time because of the vehicle under alcohol influency, were returned to tax.
The 'alcolock' would prevent it because it is a system connected to the car, it misses alcohol content in the outdoor air and prevents car starting if the driver has made alcohol tests; or if an alcohol concentration is set which is higher allowed.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are paid from those who reduce the sanction.
In this connection, a study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that the cars equipped with these devices have been prevented in the first year after its introduction up to 65% of the rules.
In Spain, 115 people can be saved annually.
The measure is restricted to the administrative sanctions of two reasons: take this behaviour before it comes to a penalty.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, a legal reform can be realised on the usual way, and however, a reform of the basic legislation is required for the criminal persecution process.
However, the device on the Spanish markets is not available in any business, although it has already been built in some use vehicles and vehicles of the public transport.
Tomorrow, the Deputy House will vote through the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party, proposed to install this system in schools, which has already been made in France.
In Mexico and without `peep-toes'
With British tendance, at 17:40 hours, for the time of the planned by the program, besides the Presidential hamper Benito Juárez de México DF, the aircraft of Spanish aircraft, with the prince and prince of Astury.
The sun went around, but their wheels have still forced to use the hand as a sun screen to see the queen couple that went out of the air.
Direct on Gangway: the Spanish ambassadors and other authorities
A couple of hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the road whether he knew the prince and the princess of Astury visit the city to form the official trip.
- Oh, very good, so, you can't take people from here or so.
No, she's the spanish, but she's living here a couple years.
- But so, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and the princess of asturies and knows the importance of the travel.
Many are waiting for the Hangar of the airport and the red teppich, even military protection of 27 military soldiers of the Marine, who give the honorsalve.
The prince appears slowly, waiting in marinblau, and she, the pristin, with long hairs of the wind, without usual `peep-toes', may she was shared that it was waiting for a grass in DF.
Before they come into the room, they laugh and are prepared on the photographs waiting for the official success.
At the door of the hotel where they are undertaken, one of the four largers in the city is waiting for them a reporter from the Mexican TV that makes pleasure.
The best Premium of the mode
Probably there was no appropriate place on the world as Paris to present a premium of the mode and probably there was no significant exhibition of models and well-beings as Valentino.
Mango presents the second expenditure of the Modern Release Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards for the promotion and enhancement of young modernists.
This is designed with money prices of EUR 300 000.
Mr Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first exhibition, has been seen in the Mango Philippale window on Boulevard Housesmann number 54 in Paris, and had almost been emotional survey.
This is the second largest business of the company in Europe and has been opened shortly. It offers a sale area of 1 335 m2.
The greatest business is in London.
Thus many events have occurred that you want to thank the Modedesigner Valentino for his jury presence at the competition.
In the area of many famous people seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the severe heart that was broken from pain because his brother died shortly, took together. He bound the way of the modern house, and had some of ELAH shots of ELAH, who were athleticed. He stood on the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters great and had Valentino at the dinner, joined his honor.
Andik, the owner and lord of the house of Mango, welcomed the guests and was so a covaler, so he ended together with the baron of Rotschild without Jacketts, because Jacketts left the dame.
Mónica Cruz, has turned to the business and had a hose and a liver that she modeled himself, and at the dinner she drew a long, black sexy clothes. In a night past through the operator, joined by Goya Toledo, she showed us a room for ballett tests, so she was revealed, remembered the old times, touched a stage and made a kind of greater'.
Inés Saster, she didn't be closed by the royalties of the palace, but before she showed us the photos of her son on the handy.
On the next morning, we could be able to rejoice about the presence of Oliver Martínez, a person who always calls a cultural warming, and on Jon Travolta, who has asked for a room after his arrival (with own bed and hands) in the International Hotel in Paris, in advance.
The stars under the Sovereign sky of Paris.
Oh, la, it's life.
1001 Council against Stress
There is no 1000, but more to forget chaotics all day life.
And if it's little, they're all gathered in a book where it's how you come to relaxation. The book comes into the book negotiations on 30 September.
The Wecker is a punishment when he sounds about 7:00 a.m., but worse appears to enter into the hectic rhythm that requires the current life.
The office calls the scanning and the computer leading to the back pains.
Stress is the evil of the 21th century.
But there is no one and no two methods to fight the daily creation and the problems that are solved from the work world.
However, the number increases not more and not less than 1001.
Besides Yoga stations, classic massage or spa, Susannah Marriott provides the entire list of opportunities adapted to the mask and the time each individual.
The work against the Stress means `1001 opportunities to resolve' and thus comes the rest that the book provides in the books of Verlag Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Who thinks that it is impossible to reach the rest in the areas such as the workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual opposes such faith.
Moreover, the methods are offered to how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural receipts that lead to relaxation.
If the Adrenalin in your venees has no longer increased to restore the balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, then the moment came to put up to the sofa to switch the brain and concentrate on reading.
I'm talking to sleep.
Some children talking night
I mean, not those who rise up and tell us what happened this day, but the children who are talking during the sleep.
If it happens to you at the first time, in the best case you'll be ashamed, but in reality it has no importance.
This is a positive sleeping that is called the speech in bed.
It's pretty widely wide, especially among children and youths.
Sure, more than one of you was told you that you talked night.
This phenomenon can occasionally occur ( once in life, for example, as during the high fiber), or regularly ( every day, once per week, once per month ), on the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no one reason that causes this appearance.
Often meetings are searched for other appearances in bed, such as alptrooms, pancreen fears night, Enièreis noctura (Betzen night), searching for talks in bed, but there is no reason for it.
As we have already mentioned, it may be very high fiber, stress situations or challenges.
Anyway, it's a little investigated phenomenon.
The happiness with which it comes is very different.
It may be that you may speak quietly in individual words, flow or be a counterpart (shore, wine, long discussions).
In the cases where the exemption is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and to advise himself at a specialist to check whether a problem is prevailing which causes fear and so is.
We said that it is a positive disappearance, so it will not be treated whether it is connected to another sleeping that can be treated (e.g. with the sleep-up or the Stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple prevention measures:
Do not try to admit the child before sleep.
So, looking for quiet game for the child and avoid stressed television programs that are terrible and something to be wild.
In the nervous children that recommend relaxation, methods of relaxation can be applied to help them get some internal peace.
This helps the child to sleep quiet.
If the speech is once in bed, try to keep peace.
Think that it is unfair for the child, and the next day it will be able to remember nothing of what happened.
Used Council proposals
Don't open it.
It's useless because the child is unconscious, so you'll get it out of bed.
Although the child says, it sleeps, so it's quiet.
Think if it shows a couple of appearances, it will be recommended to be advised or to find out what reason the child has for fear.
If they understand what it says (that's not usually), the child does not put it into pressure, to carry out more information.
So you can't achieve nothing because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and can't think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says that they are carefully with the interpretation of the information and the locks you go out.
Maybe it's not telling the child that you hear the night and know his secrets.
Not even as a shit.
That causes much fear.
So don't worry about it's nothing wrong. It's a moment that takes a few minutes.
Injury ... finally
After a long dust street, Illhauses are finally returned to success courses.
Without great efforts, the yellow blacks played many tourchancers and were able to use one of them, and thus to win the game.
The time of this congratulation, when the storm had to show their knees, was not very high.
After a first attack of the guest captain Captain Kauffmann, whose teleshould walked on the winkel, Ill homes should dominate the game with lightness, and it was now changing the foundation flow with a telephone, then hills with a high pass, and Romein with a shot with the footspitch with the removal of Danishmarks.
The gentlemanship blowed in the middle of the field and left only the viable Riahi on the side of the sturm.
The start of the second half-time should be decided to be with the first two of Riahi and Temporary Torchancens, and then the first gate for the household by Marais, who was right to recover a ballo that was rejected in the first trial of Debold.
However, the ill-shirt should not be able to enjoy his happiness and to be sent to the bank about 12 minutes later, so that his manager rooms had to continue to be paid.
However, Denmark did not use this and put an ill-haeusic Elf no major problems that were only a little back to disappear their defence, except in the last seconds of the game, in which the ballo after a great one by each other was very close to the late.
Sarkozy triffed wild fisher
Before he flights to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will still make a rescue in Britain.
In view of the decided arrest of the fishers blocked by the arrivals to several British and normal ports, the French President decided to find on Tuesday in the port of Guilvinec in finistry to meet them with their representatives.
Last speaking to receive him with a constructive spirit, and they hope that he comes with 'concreed proposals'.
The visit of the President will be found at the same time as a general meeting of the Crisis Committee established by the British fishermen to implement measures in view of the extreme increase of this price, which has reached an average value of more than 1.14 euro per letter.
In accordance with the press speaker of Elyséepalasts David Martinon, the President has discussed possible solutions with them to help their undertakings to become competitive and to ensure the working conditions and payment of the souls.
Sarkozy is expected by fishers with decisive determination.
On Tuesday morning, they led to Morbian and Calvados protest breastplates that caused the steel of almost ten kilometres long.
Quiberon's samples were also blocked, however, the connections with Belle islands weren't removed.
The Halbinsel Quiberon was limited with a sperre.
On Monday, the souls of their decision expressed their decision by burning them from early morning to riffs and pallets before the beverage depths of the ports of breast and Lorient, while the Concarneau or Saint-Briuc demonstrations were stopped.
The movement was located on other ports of the Atlantic coast and the sandwich, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Venezuela, where fishermen were not brought out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats were blocked by the managers of trade ships.
The fishermen of Turballs and Croisic in Loire Atlantics solve the blocks of the significant total refrigerator in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to attend the event of the meeting in the middle of the ministry before they decide on possible measures.
In fact, the Crisis Committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions on movement and its participation to the discussion planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fischer in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the responsible of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
`The Streik will continue, 'the fishermen will be given in no point' and' not go to Paris, for example, announced Liliane Cariou, President of the Fish Committee.
The professionals that do not pay taxs on this is costing the litter current about 50 cent, but they believe that the retailability limit of a boat only can be reached with this for less than 30 cent per litera.

Obama, winners according to points in the first television
On the first debate of the two candidates for the white house on Friday, another was followed to find who made a victory, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As the QGs expected to select both the Republics and the Democrats, their own victory in this telephone, which should be followed by a third of the American families.
The political analysis David Gergen appreciates that John McCins performance, even though it was significantly not enough to allow him to stop his delay in the election issues five weeks before the presidency elections.
The Gallup Institute, which was published on Saturday, has been issued by Obama by five points (49% to 44% for McCain), is that the democrat clearly makes the better figure.
In the still uncertained electors, so those at which it is now arrived, Obama, with 39% sheirs from the surveys, while 25% of them McCain sees a victor.
Obama should be expected to confirm its first and only public debates with his rivalin Sarah Palin on Thursday with the good performance that his fellow Joseph Biden can be confirmed in the first and only public debates
'It would be a mistake to assess it.
She has a good instinct, but she warned that weekend Bill Clinton.
The seventy-year McCain did not hear to put its unstreamable experience in the outer policy into the previous basis, and thus clearly underline the 'Nativity' of his gentlemen on these issues which formed the Mediterranean point of this first television.
'Sentor Obama doesn't seem to understand that...' he argued several times.
'I don't think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and the necessary knowledge to be President', he also assured it.
A point of action to be preached to the Republical election campaign since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself shortly and precisely without allowing himself from the vision.
He emphasized his ability to take good decisions and to renew the picture that has the world of the United States.
`McCain has not yet understood, Obama already', in this week-end a democratic elector campaign that the Republic of Justice was proposed, not to have the full extent of the crisis that remained on the 'Amerikas from the road'.
'When the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you,' put Obama yesterday before two thousand people who had gathered a election in North Carolina in a rain.
He has not even mentioned the words `Mittel stand' or 'Arbeader'. 'Financial crisis provides Obama, who keeps the most appropriate to save the economy even at the border of the base, a clear advantage.
'The next week could be a vital warning point', estimated yesterday of the influence of the democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Government of Clinton, compared to the 'acquisitive economic' Obamas with those by Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is the conclusion of an eight-year-old economic policy that is used by George Bush and is supported by Senator McCain.
After he reiterated that he might even create the taxes for 95% of the Americans, despite the weaknesses at the Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois argued that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a hospital insurance system, is the highest priority for him.
McCain wanted to create an installation from 45 nuclear powers until 2030.
The two candidates are noticed with regard to the questions taken on the financial market plan for the salvation of $700 billion (470 billion), which were adopted by the Congress evening and is extremely unlimited to the people.
'Do you notice that a choice was made in Minsk?'
Youth and opposite Sunday evening demonstrated on the main place of the Belarus capital in order to decline the results of the Parliament's elections in advance.
Some hundred white races were gathered on Sunday after the closure of the electoral locals on the market of Minsk to protest against the abusive character of Parliament's elections.
Although not yet was announced, many young people came to demonstrate the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The Dictator' will return.
Some of them don't have chosen only: 'What's protecting that if they do on my voice what they want' says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime which has shown foreign observers in the best light to restart negotiations with the European Union is ready to complete a democratic warming.
The sanctions, including the non-party of visa for 40 leading white-based personalities and the surrounding of certain powers, could be highlighted if these elections were estimated as clean observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
'We were excluded by the election committees and our observers did not participate in the figure', held by Juri Potemkin, the pressman of the Union of democratic forces, a eroogeneous joint of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, noted Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former oppositionskandidat for the 2006 presidential selection and manager of the Pro-Europe movement, because it is important to say the voices, and we are the executive.
If Member of the Opposition enter into Parliament, then because they were called and not chosen.
But their benefit in the Parliament can mean send time to television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.”
The opposition is therefore fair to enter into political game because the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Since our economy, which is strongly excused against Russia, is placed in a crisis and we do not reform, we're going to be a protector of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition is concerned that the security and cooperation organization in Europe, which has followed the election, does not recognize the choice as valid.
It emphasises that the electoral security numbers appear too high and that the extension of the stimmatic pack (26% of Minsk elector) has served the way for any type of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that a choice has been made?" asked the leader of the Social Democrates Alexander Kozulin, one of the two last political prisoners who were released in August this year.
There was nobody in the elections.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition in the parliament, both those who first comply with the Government's proposals.”
The thickness of the night turns back over the October place.
The television welcomes President Lukachenko and the members of the central election Committee for their success.
Training - Your blood that has been secured again
Hea-Quebec felt yesterday on the 10th anniversary of her creation, and her President, Dr. Francine Decary, had all reasons to rejoice, because Hea-Quebec has become one of the most safe and efficient blood banks of the world.
And above all, she reiterated the confidence of the public, which was hardly devoted by the scanal of the scanning blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, national blood reserves were requested by the Canadian red crossing service with the HI-Virus and Hepatitis C-Virus for 1980.
In view of this Dramas and insatisfactory of the public, the Government of Canada introduced a public investigation conducted by the judge Horace Krever who had aimed at bringing light into the circumstances that had been brought to such tragedy and to develop directives to prevent a further catastrophe of this kind.
During the court of Krever was still delayed to deal with his report, several provinces made a committee on the legs whose objective was to develop a new system for control of blood savings in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this order.
After the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hea-Quebec responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society, and the other province and the two Territories.
`1998, when Hea-Quebec took their work, it was about 38% of the people trusted in the blood conservation system in Quebec, it remembered Dr. Decary.
The situation was disappointed.
In order to improve the security of blood conservations and through the work in this area in the next years, we have returned the confidence of the public," she said, "before she stresses that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the population of Quebecs trust in the Hea-Quebec.
However, Dr. Decary states that 'the confidence is an extremely widespread'.
Since its creation was created on 28 September 1998, Hea-Quebec acts according to the principle of the perspective.
At that time, we experienced the income of numerous cases of human forms of oxen water in Europe, a new kind of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells this woman who incline the lead since the 1998 creation.
'And we didn't have the least idea whether this disease could be transferred over blood.
So we call on one of the main directives of the reports of Krever and Genelineau, which are implemented by the exclusive actions if you don't know and if a disease only continues slowly, as it is clearly in the Crossfeldt-Jakob disease of the case expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which leads to death inevitably.
So, in April 1999, there was no blood of people who had stopped for more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
Well, some years ago, without any doubt, this disease is translated over blood.
This event has shown us that the principle of the intention we have used through a sense.
In 1999, a much more precise technique for the recognition of HIV: the nuclein acid (NST), which allowed it to demonstrate directly the benefit of the virus itself, and not the anti-fits against the virus, as it was in the case's tests to be used.
The NST allowed the inhibition time between the time when the person was infected and when the first virus could be demonstrated by our technology in blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced by less than one week.
So the risk was that some expenses could be infected without knowing it, and you could not recognize this, significantly reduced.
These improvements allowed the risk of transferring AIDS through blood transfusion to reduce considerable measure.
Today, one of 12 million people is dangerous to receive infected blood with HIV.
"Most other words means that you should share 12 million blood samples before someone would be used with HIV.
Since hema-Quebec is distributed each year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood savings, it would take more than 24 years before a case transferred to HIV on blood conservation.
I think you can feel well today when you receive or describe blood transfusion to restore health," said the Hea-Quebec Guideline.
'Our challenge for the next 10 years is to receive the security of our products.
You're never knowing what disease leaving can be reached in the system.
First in the past year, the Chikungunya virus has been placed on the island of Reunion, which, just as the Westnil-Virus, is translated by insectes on blood.
We need to oversee without survey, Dr. Decary continues before it stresses that Hema source needs to be provided by a safe supply also sufficient supply.
'The need grows because the population changes.
Since the treatments are aggressive in the fight against cancer, the patients often need new red blood bodies or blood posts.
The overlooking of the population also affects the blood deficiency network that includes only 3% of the residents appropriate to the blood dependent.”
This can make every healthy person who is aged 18 or older and fulfill the eggs criteria every 56 days, so six times in the year, spring blood.
In average, 14% of those who have their blood will not be accepted because they have been diseased with AIDS or Malaria and who are in a country in which Malaria is distributed is excluded for a year from the dependence of blood.
'After this 3% we create it to receive an inventor that corresponds to the needs of hospitals.
The lack of pre-apparates are very rare.
But you need to renew the members of this player network when they are old and can't spend blood more.
It is difficult to convince people of it to spend blood, but especially to keep them and bring them to become regular players.
Life is so hectical today that we are rarely finding the time to deliver a hour in the bloody dependence, is deprived of Francine Decary.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hea-Quebec provides not only blood conservations, but also human weight, including knochen transplanted, heart clothes, eggs and hair, which is usually used for severe breast-feedings.
These weights will be studied, processed and investigated before they are interviewed at Hea source, which is also managed by the only public pump bank Quebecs.
In the nabel scene, which has been considered before as biomedical waste, there is rich blood that can serve hard diseases such as leukemie.
'On a few weeks, we felt the installation of our thousands of nervous blue tests, and we plan to take more than a thousand years.
'We must be starting the next years to provide it for transplantations', says Dr. Decary further, described by this programme of the Nabelsurb blue extension as very favourite.
"Multe mothers are convinced to have no access to it" because Hea-Quebec lacks the resources to offer this complex and costful program in all the Cebec hospitals.
Socicer - effect in half-final
Montreals effected yesterday by a 3 to 1-Seeges (4 to 3 with all Tors) against the sounders from Seattle at the second and decided to play the four-final series in the Saputo Stadium, where the total source content was calculated for the half-finalrund of the separation games of the first liga of the USL.
The Mediterranean player Antonio Ribeiro shot the essential gate in the nine minutes of play.
After a first half-time without the door, both for the one and the other side, the Mediterranean players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other parts for the training of Montreals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matthew Jordan for the sounders on the way.
Remember that, at the first game of the pre- and back game series, the Starfire Complex in Tukwila had introduced a 2 to 1-no item at the first game of Marattle.
In half-final, the whitecaps will be measured with Vancouver's whitecaps.
Saturday evening Thunder in the back game in Minnesota could compare a 3-1-D Efficient by a 4-3-seek, but the whitecaps went with a total natural relationship from 5 to 4 yet into the half-finalrunde.
Friday and Sunday must be effected with the whitecaps, but the details of the game series today are determined.
Kurzly said - Senator by Kovalev
The number 1-Trio of the Canadian Managing is ready to take the Saison attack.
Yesterday, the unity formed Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrey Kostitsyn, the attack on the Panther from Florida with a storm fever, which led to a 3-2-seeg.
Costitsyn, the star of the festival, shoss a gate, had two models and Kovalev transformed a step in this victory game, the fourth of the three-colors in six preparatory games.
Kovalev made the victory by shot the only door of the whole shoes.
'I'm not yet ready, the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel like I feel."
'He has been very fixed in the first half-time, Guy Carbonneau noted.
But I think he did have the end of the game.
He got sturmal accidents.'
Charest sets on the North
The Prime Minister does not conclude to include elections before the end of the year.
Once the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was finally, John Charest yesterday after John-Talon in Quebec, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (Linke) is trying to be chosen in today.
'The history of our last large border in the north: This is the long-term goal that John Charest presented at the General Assembly of the Cebecs Liberal Party in Levis, where he followed the guidelines.
During his term, a kind of paintings was projished after him.
On three great screens, the mirror pictures of water powers, mountains, Quebec in 'Google Maps' were viewed, land cards, etc.
Great resources such as during the election period.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that the elections would be stopped, even if he allowed the timetable to be very full.
The 'Plan North' is the fourth element of a Vision, which the First Minister has a pleasure for Quebec, which is the 'new economic space', which is an agreement with France on work forces, a agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although she was often mentioned in the words of the First Minister, the opening of the North was the north area at the 49st width - never had been a subject of presentation.
However, the Prime Minister was limited to explain why the north is 'un juggage with a huge potential', but no date, no investment rates or exact priorities for the following projects.
In most cases, some aspects of which could be worked more: especially the water energy, the forest, but especially the mountain construction sector benefits from the growth of the weak countries and the renewing of public infrastructure.
According to Mr Charests, the North Nickel, Zink, Kupfer, Platin, gold, silver, iron, Titan and even diamanten.
This area is two times larger than France' is' in our neighborhood, in Quebec.
It is not only close to us, it is in us, he pointed out how to clearly show that he seeks a national reasonal traum.
Quebec is very grown through its connection with the north, he pointed out: the road to gold in Abitibi, the Quebecs Technical, the James page.
'There is our future,' he added after he had put a theatral Pause to look at the great card behind.
The northern, 70% of the Quebec region, concluded a part of Labrador with which the Quebec had always been requested, explained the Prime Minister.
'This is a traditional stop that followed all governments.
There is a border line in which there is no agreement for a long time when I will take this position on behalf of the Government again."
Furthermore, "for climate change, we need to re-examin our vision from the northern," he explained and spoke about the northern West Passagies that will be dangerous by the railways throughout the year.
In front of this new geo-political background, the Prime Minister considers that it is an obligation to take this area too much.
And the inhabitants of the area, the inhabitants and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebecs Government would be very encouraged with them, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of different parties, Peter Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ancient practisers of Ungava) have already introduced consultations at some thirty-communities.
One ministerial Committee leaded by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and ground estimates) took an important place, took the work.
The Prime Minister does not conclude a great congregation, 'not at all a guppel' but an opportunity to create a common vision.'
The development of Northern will remain in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The north plan will be "related, regulated and environment," he discussed.
John Charest described this "Vision" as if she was a continuing of the liberal Prime Minister who were before him in the office.
"When the Liberals which were before us in the office we have changed to transform the challenges in new growth and development frameworks.
On the other hand, one of the topics of the weekend opened on Friday with a great cocktail party on the feast of the 50th July of the transfer of the party by John Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted provides to replace the power tool of Beauharnois in Adeleard-Godbout staudamm.
'Von Godbout, which created the Hydro-Quebec, on reading that reached the quiet revolution and the state of water electricity in Bourassa, which made James page, knew our party always to determine the future', explained John Charest.
The press was referring to another, this time conservative project, although the 'Roads to the North' of John Diefenbaker, First Minister of 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project water power stagemm Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest noted that its operation is intended for 2012.
'It remains among us, but I have proposed to be on this,' he admitted his members to what it was called at these accidents.
The Prime Minister, who said in April 2008 that it was, and of course, 2009, would not give elections, has in fact the possibility of keeping a choice that is possible to be excluded by the law.
He notes, however, that his datetable is full, especially because of a Community Council mission in China and of a jubile between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend made the Free Party a platform of national plans, particularly of the 'the Constitution' objectives adopted without others: the PLQ particularly calls for recognition of the 'Bese Speciality of Quebecs' in the Constitution.
She also wishes to submit to Quebec members of the Council of the Canadian Round and Telecommunications, and that they have a veto in respect of the decisions adopted in Quebec.
From the sides of the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan were taken with scepsis.
The Chef of the Québecois Party, Pauline Marois, reiterated the policy for the development of the North Duke Source which introduced the Government Landry 2001.
In view of this, you have the free government when she came to the power in 2003, to apply them.
If it had been done, we have already been a lot further today, Mrs. Marois urged the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (when the election is today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ agreed to support the adoption of a North Plan by the Government.
'But what we want is that this will not only be a great idea' said the Participant Sebastien Proulx in reply to Mario Dumont, which today returns from the vacation.
Letters - An entityed country
Mr. Vic Toews, Ex-'Justiz' Minister (Ironia) in Kabinet Harper was the last summer allowed to say about Louise Arbour that she is a 'Schande' for Canada.
This woman who has led to fight for justice and has all our surprises to discover with shame, says much about people around the Prime Minister, like Stephen Parker himself.
We have to do it here with a government who has not led their landlord in the Guantanamo concentration campaign at home as the only one of the countries concerned.
A government that has not even taken into account Omar Khadr was a younger than the things happened to him.
The only government which, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Gender Convention, makes its word and allows a childsold to prevent it under immense conditions.
The only one who turns back to a justice parliament to appreciate the fault of the complaint.
Remember that, above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International, and the association of Canadian advocates are planned to bring Omar Khadr home to get an right process in Canada.
This government also closes the eyes before the followers: it is a little interest that a young adult will be broken in so many years of warmly self-related for ever.
We are not aware of this yet, but we just live here a home-country circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our democracy, this word, which Harper always leads to himself as a fashion, and that out of his mouth sounds so unfortunate.
There is therefore time when there is no moral any more: a Canadian citizen can seem to missy, folter and uncover, fully after the goods of a government captain that is supported until today only from minority (hereinafter its entire minority after 14 October).
Many of the electors believe to find your heal at a party preaching the acts, law and order, but they do not see that this government has disappeared from what the call and the power of our country did.
The shame, Mr Toews, is in this location, and there is nothing elsewhere else.
Free view - The Orwellsche speed of Barrick Gold
In its publication of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr Patrick J. Garver, Director-General of the Canadian Goldmine Barrick.
This confirms and follows an orwell logic that the world's greatest gold winning society has opened a deployment of six millions against three authors and a small medium-sized delay house, with the aim of opening a public overseas debate.
If it is true that the judges are independent and unparty, they shall not advise the truth, especially not in the case of offence, but in the law.
It is expected that this fundamental difference was fully different by Mr Garver.
For for Barrick Gold, the best kind of leading a public debate is to take every one into the street that is trying to present one of their opposite opinions.
As the process comes, the authors and the producers of the book Noir Canada must be given considerable summers to prepare their defence and fight with very unrelimited weapons against a army of candidates that are payed from the nailly unconscious silvery of the mine.
The tactics in these unlike wars is often to destroy the defenders in order to enhance a unique regulation that makes the opposite average, and in addition to all who are about to consider the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have to present their views on public opinion.
In contrast, what is in many countries where Barrick Gold is working, walk and gone, it is usually exposed by exchange of ideas and not by kitchen.
It would therefore be satisfactory if the Goldmin opened its books and acts and opened a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent tests that would have been able to bring the light into this matter.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have confidence in the public view, and the requests and letters for supporting the authors of Noir Canada have been a hand movement.
Maybe Mr Garver could explain how he can at the same time ask for a public debate and, however, missed the opinions of this public?
This word includes in the world of the Vice-President only the largely paid advocates, and not the Community of all Canadians; a very beautiful view of the opinion.
In a democracy, people themselves have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or do not understand - is that the public supporting the authors and producers of Noir Canada is particularly due to this because they reject the brutal stop of gold mine.
This public is ready to hear and advise Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that is to determine many as a knebel box (in the history of the 'Public Debate' Barrick Gold has just directed a request to the authors of Noir Canada, in which they are requested not to use this order....
Notwithstanding the surreal talk by Mr Garver, Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom to academic research and the fairness of the truth, which are based on every democratic society.
It is completely low to the right to settle confidence sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the base of the intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to investigate and discuss the issues that do not like the rich enterprises of this world, who else can then do this?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead them by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we are involved is known to get over a long timely, discussions and disappearances in the riot and solve conflicts.
The uncontainable table of Barrick Gold clearly shows that it, in contrast to what she provides, has no pleasure on a transparent debate.
This is a loss of the university world, as well as the public debate, and it will be time that the Governments take actions to decline this kind of unfair instruments.
Rescue action for the Wall Street - Democrates and Republicians understand
The manager of Bush and the leading Congress Councils, Republics and Democrats, at last, came to an agreement on the largest economic management plan since the 30-year-old depression.
The new version of the Plan of 700 billion dollars, which will stop the financial crisis, which has been destroyed by the Wall Street, is still needed to be adopted by the two Congress Chambers.
The main contents are: a better control of Members on the practical application of the plan to ensure new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public money established in order to incorporate the number of houses planted based on payment restraints, and the right to monitor the holders that are payed to the leaders of the undertakings.
The American Financing Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Deputy Chamber Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republics in the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, yesterday, announced a few minutes after the north, the good news, after a second-time negotiation marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective,' said the representative of the Bush Management, Henry Paulson.
'All happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis at the Wall Street', the Democrate explained.
'This is the fundamental point: if we don't do this, the dreams, the chaos and the disgusting in the daily life of Americans will be anorm," the Republic of Judd Gregg said.
During the last two hours, the negotiations had accelerated, with fear of the effect that a new shipment had been made on the shadow of investors.
The time that was agreed was the market opening today.
The two American presidency candidates, who were involved in the negotiations, showed more than the defenders of the agreement, however, without dealing with their unfriendly comprehensiveness in this extreme way.
The Democratic Senator Barrack Obama has been assigned on the addition to the agreement, especially those that should allow the owners to keep their homes, and those with the holders of the leaders of the undertakings saved by the State.
"If you ask the tax payer to take extraordinary responsibilities because of the unfair responsibilities of certain persons, it is nothing to make lucky.
But these measures are necessary, he explained the American television students.
When he was asked by another sender whether he will vote for the proposed plan, his reply to his reply John McCain: 'I would like to know the details only, but I hope it.
'The guides I have read [sight] that this is a thing that we all need to be confident, and with which we will be able to go forward.
The option to do nothing, it's just not acceptable', he said.
The 700 billion dollars plan is prepared with the money of tax payers
It comes for 14 months after a crisis, with the locations of an inmobiliary bulletin, which initially leaded to the composition of the risked hypothec credits (Subprey) before it extended on further forms of widely widely supplies (PCAA), and finally reported in an enrolment of the financial force and in the markets of banks and monetary institutions.
A Republical Deputy Group was the first trial for the agreement last week.
Since the democrates accepted that some 'employed' activity of societys only is secured by the government and have not to be bought, the sack gas is believed.
In order to cut the views of all the Congress, it has also been added that, if the Government had to lose this programme within five years, it could then be able to produce new taxes to retain its established capital.
The new plan provides the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to reach further 100 billion, if the President is necessary.
Further payment of 350 billion must be adopted in a resumption of the Congress.
In the contrast of his assistance, Washington will take part of the supported companies that bring to him in the case of benefits, and who can return to sell it when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility of maintaining the procurement procedures relating to the apartments associated with this plan, and also to fix the periods for reimbursement and exemptions paid to the leaders of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like that the Deputy Chamber had already been over it today, and the Senate then on middle-eight.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet sure that their green light will be obtained.
Today, there are other votes against this project, both from the sides of the Republic and the Democrats.
"Only, Washington does not understand us", said the Republic of Scott Garett, member of the Financing Committee of the Chamber, his electors.
'Yes, we have a great financial problem.
Yeah, there are solutions.
But not those who exist in asking the tax payers to the cash.
The Democratic Deputy Brad Sherman, head of a group in the Congress, called 'the Kaukus of the Sceptiker', makes it different, but it comes to the same conclusion.
'Five hundred designed economic prosecutors, including three nobel prices, have written to share us: we are asking the Congress to not set up on pressure, and to carefully consider what way is to be made,' he explained yesterday.
At the same time, we returned to Europe the evidence that it is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the Statement of the Bank Group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The claim of the Governments of Belgium, which were necessary to the Netherlands and Luxembourg, after the French BNP Paribas recognized that it would be able to sell their competitor in great difficulties since they lost two billion euros (2,9 billion dollars) in the crisis through the risk of the real estate credits in the United States.
Fortis is employed for 85,000 persons and are the 20 major European banks and the ten largest surveys.
'There is not lost money, the Dutch financial Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
As a result, we receive an election right and influence in the Bank.
This is exactly what the sponsors and households appreciate now when they announce more inadequate time.'
During this time, the U.S. was on the other side of the sanctuary canal, the U.S., on the other side of the coal, to produce a bank from the financial crisis in Belarus.
According to the English press, the government would overcome all loan credits at the Bank Bradford and Bringley, including 41 billion (75.5 billion US Dollar) from real estate credits.
The Spanish Bank Santander told yesterday that they would buy the Philippals and the customer accounts of the British Bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank that the British government has to be stated since the start of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of an affected Iconone
His beauty with the blue eyes was long time his tromp, nobody would say his weak.
Did the American player be freed from the narcistic speed?
Yes and no.
His Feing feelings, his sensibleness and an apparent talent have detained him as well as from a power that brings the real foreign monster into the world.
But what's for a great duty vendor!
On Friday in 83 years, Paul Newman died at the consequences of Lunging Crebs on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last Icons of the American kine of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, and for the long time he was a kind of rivale on the lake, carefully in his spectrum, as well as widely widely, but exactly a apostle of freedom and dramatic conventions.
The lossed blood makes wonderful children often.
He was born in 1925 as a son of a German Jewish and an Hungarian mother.
From its European roots, one of the rich faces of the American dreams should be made.
Without overtime I, the most extreme quality character.
For he revealed a whole country that had been loved in the self-made-man, in the battle of the Pacific War, which studied the beginning of the 50-year spectrum in Yale and then visited the Actor's studio in New York before success in the theatre, television, and soon also in Kino.
Even this man who fighted for civil rights was also the driver who became at the 24th hours of Mans second, and also a sex symbol, although he lived together with the player Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown factors of this secret, retained, enthusished, and against the super-empfind stars of the showbuss, whose races will never be fully solved.
A comprehensive man, in the most pure meaning of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans was transferred to the Kino Dear of this weekend in Taumel, while on the dark screen of the memories all its great roles were played.
More than a half - century American movie art in permanent change goes to him.
As the charming Cowboy is returned from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969), and the young man who revealed his wise woman (Elizabeth Taylor) to the catze on the hot beach, who was encrypted in 1958 by Tennessee Williams.
It will be a lot more shorter rememoration of the 1990s, which will be observed at his sensitive Mr Bridge, who will be held in his high age of marriage, which does not satisfy all its promises.
Thus many other Paul Newmans were in the story.
This Criminal, cultural, forced and unconscious Rocky Graziano from somebody Up There Likes Me (One hand full dreck) by Robert Wise, a role that was thought for James Dean after his death was taken again and known to the Newman in 1956.
This sympathic ganove in the overwhelming The Sting (The Clou), which was designed in 1973 with the Oscar for the best film.
As prohibited and raced Billard player in the wonderful The Hustler of Robert Rosen (1961),
It's his face through the time, that was he.
He's still.
In his life course, Epoches are united.
The younger knows him, especially from the cut film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodoxen trainer of a eishockey team.
His Fans found him in The Hudsucker of the Brother Coen in 1994.
With a last role in 2003 as a Pate of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes concluded the round.
In contrast to several kilometres who have gone quite early from the film world, Newman should stay long in the satellite, and then Hollywood, his skills, his punch and his consents.
The French film master Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without Humor, as a living challenge at the 'Underplating' when he assessed his explicit performance to all the explicit performances.
It was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, which the roles were so long.
However, he played rarely Sunnyboys as an external seat: Neurotiker, alcoholics, fibres or doubts, with which he reflected his complaints and his advice.
As a Register, Newman entailed unknown pages of his fair feelings.
His wife Joanne Woodward, Rachel from 1968 (as after the Roman of the Candierin Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, was a feminin woman portrait of full melancholie.
He, who lost his son Scott by a superdosis, endeavoured his film Harry and Son, a work of full feeding and droughtness.
At the river of earnings, which yesterday about Newman ergos, he explained his friend and former arms, Robert Redford, who had been in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Its presence has improved my life and this country.'
Greatness and livebread were essential properties of the destroyed player.
Besides his legend carrier, a large defender of civil rights, the environment protection and the independent kinos, a gentleman of the Abdrift Hollywood, is now present.
We have often seen him standing with foot in shoes full winegrettes, in sauces, shoes or other foods, and this is for quite unfortunate, although we had found it in the beginning.
However, the gains from its circumstances flee in his foundation for children in need.
Instead of his mythos, Newman entered into the shoes.
He left his five daughters a letter with these series: 'Every and until the end, your father was unbelievingly grateful for his good star.
It was a honour to be here."
And for us, it was a privilege to pursue the life of a so intelligent and great American player.
A former citizen, in extreme and attractive meaning.
What was produced in the calculation factory of adjudication & amp; Co.?
On October 8, the negotiations in the criminal process begin against János' adoption and its compliances.
The complaint is in particular the participation of organized criminality, and the grave damage and business abuse, and other criminal acts, including other documentation-proof.
According to the Government's administration, the funds used for their own purposes were used while the performance produced were often assumed with feasibility accounts.
State money and subsidies of the self-management - total of HUF 65 million - should be part of the Fiatal Baloldal organisation, partly in private cases.
As noted by the submission authorities, the tax accounts were presented in the case of the census, and the Veryne must not be followed.
The appeal should be made as a major part of the accounts.
The account carts were bought on the market of Józsefváros, and the road seal was completed in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies should be issued the accounts was decided on those Russians northern from the Platting Sea sent to the Staván Lados adoption of János.
In the course of this "Encountering" Lados' pensions and restaurants should be completed.
He requested accounts on consumers to be able to provide more later accounts for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Social and Working Ministry and Budapest's self-administration.
These accounts will mostly be manipulated by István Lados and its compliance, András ◆ri, which should have been responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports.
One of the Lados' targets was a bierlocal.
As a result of two accounts issued by adjudication and Co in 2003, the Gastronomia operation has been responsible for the ninety-known group of the Wetos Pont Egypte student.
But now, the head of the operation, a sort of such a large group would not even enter into the local.
Another account, issued in the summer 2002 on the Stifification Jobb Jöv оite, later known as Egyptian a Harmadik Evezredredt, which also opens serious form and content errors.
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, which is only available over three rooms and is not able to hide more than 10 persons at the same time, they have to be kept under 130 guests.
The factory of the calculators was clearly not limited when it was about the Pigal Kft. A Gastronomic operation, in the booking of the Customers Job Jövìrt and Hopá was not just appeared.
As Chief of Business Gyćzć Farkas of Hvg.hu shared, he was immediately clear that it was acting on the former documents as he was presented by the State Administration during an interrogation document.
"Our company name and the tax number were wrong placed on the steel."
And further: Review of formal errors was also wrong that the operation should have a hundred people in the way they have a total of eleven rooms, which offered a lot of people as unable.
The restaurant has also been added to the account, as far as it's not already operating for a long time.
The account officers also denied to check that the Budapester's budapester offered exclusively travels to the Ausland, and so they indicated Hungary travels on the barriage calculation, which was also contrary to the accounting practice of the company.
As noted in the period of the summits, they also have introduced the minimum value tax, although travel services that belong to a country outside the EU are free of more value.
The rate of the pay value tax was totally due to four of the Hotel Rev Plenp Kft. to the stipulation Jobb Jövderst, as the operation was not only 25 percent of the MwSt., but is also exposed by the employees exclusively machinery accounts that had been manually used by the workers.
Another error that was undertaken by the "reception lawyers" was that they had indicated in a case of "Transport" performance, although it was not offered by the company specialized on investment management, the State authorities participated.
Another form error - false account format, false stempel - was thanking that those at Egyptian Harmadik Evezredredt Alapítvány could have been identified as a plant. Szazadi Kulturaliis Egyptessület and Biztos Pont.
Also in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports Layer Kunfehertó, whose business managers were never exposed.
Another "failer" is the filasters in the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this company was at the time (2001) just in solution when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egypter team had been eating there - the Masse manager gave the fact that the facts were not to be exposed.
Knowledged
The other group of account teachers is the person who had been aware of that they needed to impose physical accounts.
On visiting the Fiatal Baloldal - Sijú Szocialisták, the Stiftung Esély Budapestèret Alapítvány has issued accounts for the Egyptian Stiftung at Harmadik Evezredrett, in a height of HUF 4 million.
According to the complaint, the manager of the Collab Kft. was transferred by one of the complaints, Ludovic Gyorfi, to the exemption of the fiscal accounts.
The current biogate in Liquidation will also be working with approximately and co.: In 2003, the GmbH will provide the Stifification Jobb Jövért Alapítvány, as well as the Vereine Atlasz Egypsület and the Vereine Atlasz Egyptery and Verösfeny diets with feed accounts in the total value of HUF 5 million.
However, there was little payment movement, since the accounts were directly caused after their exhibition, which the persons concerned had forgotten to avoid the fact that they were concerned in their documents.
The third group of account officers includes those who are directly connected to the complaints.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postbot of the Ukrainian business manager of Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest, but there is not found in the Budapest.
This company should have issued several accounts on the sale of EDV components in the total value of HUF approximately 18 million.
According to the Delivery Authority, the Cash Investment Kft, from Kiskunhalas has been a buyer of these accounts since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Roman, which should also be granted by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has made accounts on behalf of the GmbH, the Vereine Atlasz and Hopá, as well as Egyptian a Harmadik Evezredredt Alapitvány and has been casted by their own value.
The company Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos investment Bt. should be founded by Romanian walls on Iván Kubatovs.
However, there was no such companies active, which was lacked by lack of fees.
However, he could benefit from the undertakings: at the request of his compliance, the lawyer Zsolt Scente, who was assigned with the preparation of the company-based schemes, he made accounts on the verses made in connection with the adjudication, such as atlass and Y-Generated.
In total, Kubatov 15 accounts in the total value of HUF 14.2 million. On behalf of the company Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The State administration means that Kubatov could have caused by 10% of the account rates and the pay value tax.
Kubatov must even missed the company SZ-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of physical accounts - in this case, the accounts were attached to the purchases of Bizos Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-Geneeralis and Szövetsëg have granted its contributions to the common organization of socialist parties, Tancsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Boths received by 500,000 forcents, but these amounts have protected sweet flowers.
To clarify this, the TMA has proposed five physical accounts of the Working Team Kft.
However, these cases were secured at the investigation of the Office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
At the negotiations, some complainants now are appealed with a comprehensive complaint on the action of accounting, as they have already been assigned before the State authority.
A sensation may be if the main complainant János agrees to a comprehensive complaint.
His present information was less detailed, and even though he had already been advised to report morely about all, his comprehensive understanding is still out.
The question therefore remains open, whether this is in his interest whether the socialists have completed a package with him with regard to the recovery of the majority of HUF 50 million of HUF, and whether the adoption is ready to take the responsibility.
However, it is possible that the adoption is now playing the "sounded" after his search was thrown on the immigration of the prison and household on taste ears.
During other crimes that have become larger damage with economic disappearances and have not harmed them on free foot or at least are under households, this opportunity remains damaged.
The psychology of the delivery - or why we are ready to pay more
In decrease, the purchasers will be able to provide more and therefore to overlook the fair charges.
Neurologs and Economic Researchers at the University of New York are now able to discover the neurological-economic basis of this famous and apparent irrational behaviour.
According to a "Science" study published in the "Science" Magazin, people want to be in a competition, such as a decrease on eBay, and therefore are ready to pay even overwhelmed prices.
The researchers have tried to consider the neurological scheme of this "Spiels" with experimental interventions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto, while others in a player's action, in both cases, were studied the active hirn regions of the Probands through functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
At both games, the participants could gain money, however, an increased activity of the Striatum, a comprehensive part of the brain, measured in the loss of the authentication, in which the delivery of the guest plays an important role.
Besides many other functions, this Hirn region is responsible for the neur system.
The researchers therefore believed that price increase had been explained by avoiding the repercussion of the Striatum.
In order to undertake them, the economy in the Research Group have made further investigations for the follow-up of the money.
In this case, three groups should provide a partner under different conditions.
The control group was reported to the true value of the product, then they made their benefits.
Another group was promised to pay for $15, for the case they're out of the game.
The third group received $15 before the Auction who were lost in the case of a lost game.
So the difference between two groups was only that the remark was at one of the win, while the other was lost.
As proof of the hypothesis expressed by Neurologs, the members of the 'the losses' group were ready to higher levels than those in the control or "Gewinn" group.
"These results are not allowed by any previous economic theorie.
Those have only found the behaviour observed by the Auctions only with the joy of the benefits or risk prevention.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved by the forming neurological procedures so we have prepared a third declaration" said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Economic Faculty of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When is the doctor looking for?
A half billion people lead to chronic hepatitis B or C around the world, and this chronic liver disease is covered by the leading death causes.
The number of infected countries is estimated to 100 thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is that patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the summit for various virus, infective lever diseases.
The symptoms are often similar - levering and ice often, however, differently differ from the heirs and the diseases of each other.
The hepatitisvires are divided in two different types: hepatitis A and E by the hepatitis A and E (e.g. by contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the virus can be transferred through blood and other body flowers (e.g. sperma, secre or special) by hepatitis B, C and D.
Returns are recommended a vaccination against Vires A and B, in any case, against virus C there is no vaccination.
The symptoms at Hepatitis A shown about two-third weeks after the cleansed food and are involved in general of integers, weaknesses, building pains and breach.
Then the skin of the skin and the eyes, the throne will be shining, the dark urin, and the profit can take up until two-third weeks.
The world is about 1 million people die from hepatitis B, far more severe diseases such as leber crystals and leber cirrhosis.
The main reason is that, according to the summits, only each ten infected in medication is infected.
Hepatitis C may also have severe consequences: it can lead to levercyrhose and leber crobs.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease, since heirs are defeated secretly - in many cases the first symptoms after 20-30 years.
Therefore, a timely prediction, such as regular control investigations, is uncertain.
There are three groups in which this disease is more frequently presented: those who have undertakened a blood transfusion before 1991, on drugs dependent on and tactowed.
Currently the number of diseases in chronic hepatitis C is estimated at 200 million in the world.
Since the disease is already shown in a routinely laboratory investigation, it is ratified to visit the household at the first sign of an unknown origin.
It is timely recognized that the disease is healable that the virus can be extracted, whereby the infection risk is blocked and the census is prevented.
On 30 September, hepatitis was published the world Day for the first time of patients in the world.
The goal of action is to strengthen the consciousness of these chronic leather use caused by Vires, their resolve and the importance of early recognition.
Have faith less pain?
As the new results of research shows that religious faith as a kind of "sweet" which has already been able to facilitate the Catholic martyr.
Scientists of the University of Oxford have performed an interesting experiment: It was studied in what way the faith in God affects human pain heritages, reported the British sheet "Telegraph".
In the highest survey, 12 believers and Atheists received electric shocks, while they studied a friend of God’s mother.
As the results shown, believers could disable the majority of pain.
The means of a hero-scan technology could even be shown that the catalyses could enable the part of their brain which is responsible for pain regulation.
The investigation was the first in a research project to participate with the philosophys and theologists of different departments of the University.
In the trial, the probands were bound to the left hand of the electric shocks.
The participants were requested to concentrate strongly on two branches: to a image of God's mother, formed by Sassoferrata in the 17th century, and to the other Leonardo da Vincis "Dame with the heritage".
The researchers hoped that the view of the virgin Mary among the believers would be called a kind of religious trance while they chose Vincis image, because it was a little different from the other species and inherently.
The attempts have each half hour in a MRI scanner, and in this period 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they should see the religious or the other species.
The Catholics reported that they would feel “in safety” when the mother of God had seen as if they were "sure and peace."
During the view of the religious gentlemen, they reported more than 12% less pain than when they had Leonardos work in their eyes.
The psychologist Miguel Faria, who also at the attempt of participative, said that similar effects could also be called to other, strongly affecting images at the Atheists, you should find the appropriate photo.
"We need to find an image that is very positively solving receipts like a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
The English Bishof Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and it also makes in many cases," as right.
After these excellent results, only the question of which effects a Madonna image Leonardos or other comparable masters would remain on the pain regulation of believers.
Should the high quality virgin Mary achieve better results?
You're what you share of.
In addition to her tenth birthday, Google can say that it is in the tails of humans as well as about their heads in the sky: they know where people have dedicated their vacation to which they are going, and what they move.
And so it is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's business managers.
In direction of Sceptiker, which are fixed by Orwellschen horrorvisions, it can make it possible: these would just see the essential of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the financial Times, Schmidt recently said that the main objective of Google was to collect more personal data about users and then the original target of the company would like to be closer to “all information of this world”.
Schmidt explained that Google has always been working on the world's work after ten years.
As he asked the status Whato in five years, he said, he wanted to be able to Google to ask how "What am I to do tomorrow?" or "What's working really going to answer me?", but it's not still in the way that it's not enough about the users.
Not all the internet users are sure that the search decisions are registered during their Internet searching, as well as the IP addresses that were searched out, and the visited pages.
For example, the "Personalised Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitors to save their own search course and then retain on this basis, so that the division may be generated much more precisely, and on the same logic also based on the "recommended recommendations" with which the system recommends measured products and services on the basis of the previous preferences.
However, the users ask what happens in the case of a data use - "If you see what I do" - some are worried about the Google datamonopol.
In most cases, however, the representated, potential power that affects fear, and less the feeling of debt or fear of explosion, the fight on freedom or the opposition of power against many internet users.
However, it is a clear fact that the search decisions are not only saved but also to thirds, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A paradewise game for this was unlonged with the action against the Pedophilie in Brazil, in addition to which Google of the Brazilian Government informed information collected by the Community session on behalf of the "Ortent" and also an identification of the Pédophilians.
For personal rights concerned users, however, could still be retained in May when Google has been able to successfully with the Civil Rights Organization of EFF against the FBI: then Google can also be encouraged with no consideration to provide information to the FBI on a secret question.
(Against, the Federal Government has successfully achieved the output of 50,000 Web addresses and 1.000 search decisions in relation to the adopted youth protection law, however, she has been maintaining the list of individual users in relation to their web and searching list on two months.)
Google's image remains circumstances: Those who doubt their personal data, because they fear the loss of their private and intimidation, makes the company strict to the conservative company.
In this way, the American "Geek-Cultur", present in many countries and enthusiast computerfans, actives and users, encountered the next generation of the "coolen undertakings" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market manager, even if both fighting the same goal.
A possibility reason is that Google does not require its users in contrast to Microsoft's code of identification, and its services are free, so that a open, constant updated source code and software package appears far to be an attractive, judicial and cooler when the official practices of the software providers.
On the other hand, the geeks view the problem of personal rights and the Internet Messers Charf - a relationship that has been affected, particularly in the past years, thanks to the meaning of “Web 2.0”.
In the "Web 2.0", there is nothing else than cooperation, that the users are left away from shapes and use the available communication channels, and even if the extents are individually different, the main stock remains the same to show public.
A average youth can also manage its profile on several Community ports - by Facebook over Xanga, these with other services such as Twitter or music services such as last.fm, and can finally connect to a follow-up system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. It can also lead blogs that make the latest photogaleries that are automatically presented on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of more accent cases demonstrates: In view of the party photos of the last night, the friend of her unfair friend, or the employee will be released, because he only makes his happiness to the company management air - one is sure: "Privatsphäre" has been interpreted in the middle of his blog.
One who leads a online life is what he presumes from himself - in some ways it could formulate the fundamentals after the behaviour of today's youth.
And whoever's trying to keep something secret, or even if you're going to go through the Google monopol, it can be pleased to do it - like with Scroogle, a tool reaching the Google search machine, but it's obviously that there's no tracks behind.
Not a few people, obviously, register not on Community lines so that they are not found but also on the online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphical RSS tools and functions, can be used with alternative versions that are not bound to large server parks and therefore not to generate the best possible profile from the user.
The public opinion will therefore be expected to show up the real face of Google.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even before IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the public surfaces of AdWords/AdSense affect the income of the public agencies, and the more rapidly introduced services are prepared not only Microsoft but also other software developers.
However, critical viewers also find the inconsistent contradictions: so the management of the employees has demonstrated a proof of the employer's employees in the way when the costs of the major child garden were deployed in the knee, also considered the management that the more timely deployment of the employees would be costly played. However, it is just too mild that Google was even in 2006 before the Chinese government, and was aware of the agreement, and that all regimes of cross-bordering, or those who have disappeared against the good tactics would be filtrated.
In the internal regulation of the concert, there is no new service, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the following months and years could re-enforce some critical: some of my Google's books and Magazinscan projects are in a short term that the company must soon be held with the chief Court of Justice, so the "Health" system is morely unrealised that the creation of a complete health profile is allowed by findings, persons and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of the Sci-Fi authors already provides the substance - such as "Scroogled", the famous Roman by Cory Doctorow described in the best orwellical manner, a future in which a human thanks to Google will be inherent.
Two young people help the double transport of Ozd in the removal
With regard to the dual murder of Uzd, the police has now convicted two young people who are in the defence of assisting the removal of the springs to participate in the Chairman of the Police Commissioner Borsod on Sunday.

The financial crisis from the view of European newspapers
In their continued international financial crisis comments, some leading European leaves already said on Sunday on 11 September.
The global financial catastrophe, we have given thanks to the American President, said, "The Republic" - the President has not even been able to make his own party to the legislative process back to one who should lead something to the resolved situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the Millennium Investor Warren Buffect called it, it would be an opportunity to speak of a "left 11. September".
Parts of the Presse in Madrid also prayed the sinnbock in Washington.
In view of the "El Mundo", the lack of political leading is that the world economy is now at the edge of the combustion.
The American financial system is still more to break up, and then the whole world will lead.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now after the vote in the Congress, the danger that Washington has not paid political resources to crisis management.
The world economy stands in the air, just at one time, since one of the largest transformations of the history of capitalism.
You can't let the threat more than eye, mean about the "Tages Shower".
However, some States could provide their money-reservation packages in the wagons and the banks with the money of the tax payer before the Bank Road.
However, if a Jehovah’s effect is solved and there is still more banks, then there is no other financial prices or other immediate measures.
The long-term EU Member States should focus on their shadows and concentrate controls on the money markets.
On Monday, more than 100 billion euros have been paid to huge money institutions, it reminds the Wiener "The Standard". In addition, the newspaper is always more realistic that, after the Americans, the European tax payers should now take something more deep in their tails to get out of the crisis.
Today, the EU has not seemed seriously with the crisis that is now like a tsunami over the old continents.
However, the "Retter" should not immediately be paid with more than 100 billion euros "while", but it would be ratified to determine, in which case it would be likely to take the money of the tax payers to disappear a further damage.
Intelligent car follows the Hummel flight
What would be the best method for developing new technologies to prevent accidents if not analyzing obstacle symptoms from nature?
For example, the goods.
The CEATEC in Japan was presented a great project in which the Nisan Ingenieure of Hummels was inspired in the creation of new accidents of disagreement systems.
In cooperation with the Tokioter University, Nissan has built the biommetric system controlled by authors in the type BR23C, a minimal car, equipped with the properties of the goods, aimed at supporting the development of a system that prevents each collection.
In the air, each good forms its own "Privat Area", which is very similar to our own "Schutzschild" said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, in exhibition.
The collapsed eye of the goods, which can see in every direction and in a winkel of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in it.
In order to follow the function of the assemblies, researchers take the idea of the lager controlled distance measurer.
This identifies barriers before BR23C in a face area of 180 degrees within 2 metres, calculated their disappearances and sends signals to the microprocessor, which immediately introduces the collection process.
The barrier is registered in secondly browsing parts, and the author will immediately change the course, similar to the movement of the goods by driving the rivers around the relevant winter.
In contrast to the present systems, this manager will be pure instinct.
"If it is not so, the author could not react fast enough to disappear the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the author project.
The system must react instinctly and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most inner and degradable part of the protection ship - a weakness that is still in the accidents of the present time.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of the goods when they disappear with other goods.
And that's got to go through a second.
However, the exhibition, in contrast to the goods, can't down, down, or even diagonal follow - can only be twodimensional, or only in direction to the fulness of the riffs.
During the goods here unendly, many opportunities were open to disappear other goods, researchers could only be used at the author's officer's movement, in relation to the disappearance and disappearance.
The BR23C contains the lithium polymer battery that are easier and energy efficients, and therefore have a longer life-time time than the traditional lithium batteries.
Andoh explained that it appears to the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less on the processing of the data, and less on the ability to save them.
This device shall only process some imports for seconds and react on it accordingly.
It should not save this, or by the former manager produce an intuitive, logical reaction, so that it is running by taking a handful KB memory in a position.
There is no need of gigabyte and Megabyte Memries.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collection technology that will be seriously produced after estimating Nisan in the next 10 years.
Another application could find technology at the GPS satellite vitamion by knowing the carrier's obstacles around and lead it to the target.
A name for the singer child
Now, the written version of the 700-Mrd-Dollar's hard rescue package is presented to apply in several steps and provides the purchase of the bad credits of the banks.
In the first step, half of the money must be issued.
At a meeting which ended after the north-Ost of East, the Congress Authors have been held after a multi-agency debate on an agreement on the 700 billion billion dollar of delivery packages, reported advice.
"We have achieved significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President in the American Deputy House, and said that the agreement should only be made to a paper.
The compromise granted on the rescue package supported both presidency scenarios - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said to the result: the programme will be shown effect and will be effective, but it should be done more. According to Pelosi, it was not for the salvation of the Wall Street, but for the reasons that it was to ruin the market of the economy.
The written version of the package has been published before opening the Asian markets, so Washington's 8:00th of summer ( average European time Monday 2 hours), but there has not been any high flight on the boats.
On Monday, the Deputy House first decides on the legislative draft on the stabilization of the economy of 2008, then the Senate is on the series.
President George W. Bush said to the Saturday with Pelosi, and also the white house welcomed the news on the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made in the night and we appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize and protect our markets, said Tony Fratto, white house speakers.
However, the programme depends on the original recommendation of Bush Administration, which the 700 billion dollars should be issued for the buyer fauler, with credit-related value papers.
In a first tranche the maximum half of the 700 milliards amount, whereby 250 billion are available immediately after the Congress is voted on the Monday on Causa. This sum is to be applied for the buyer's lower values, and the President should decide over 100 billion.
The programme will be reviewed by a own Commission, who is also attended by the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 milliards depends on a further decision of the Congress.
In the meaning of the law, the Ministry can also apply a combined tactic: it can at the same time buy bad credits, hypothetics and hypothecs charged value papers, or other "time" credits.
As the responsible persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be carried out as well as directly.
The law allows the undertaking concerned to participate in a programme of insurance to ensure the funds of the Ministry of Competence and the companies to pay the appropriate costs to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said that the law defines the necessary resources so that up to $700 billion can be provided as a assistance for the American financial system, whether it is a larger purchase of lower funds, their insurance or the removal of a system risk that will be solved by the collection of a greater money institution.
We set the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as Paulson has been signed.
However, the Chefs of the banks in difficulties and now assessed by State aid can assess that their exemptions called in the oversease-Slang Salopp "Green Handshake" are cut by the government.
A reduction of the holders will only be given in certain cases, and these shortcomings will be deemed to be as the Financial Minister for each other.
The rate means that if the ministry buys an autation, the "Green Handshake" is controlled, unless the extensive banking team is thrown into the pension.
In the case of a direct purchase of the faul credit, the government will be aggressive to ensure that managers are not transferred.
The image also includes that the existing gold-shake contracts are not modified - the restrictions are only to new agreements, so that more people participate in the programme.
This is the first case in the American story that courts are regulated by law managers, commented by the Democrat Barney Frank, President of the Finance Committee, the measure.
The State grants the rights of participation to the participating banks, so that the risk for tax payers can also be involved, as soon as the economy is, and so that the released bank is also better.
The draft legislation provides that the President should submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years, as the tax paid money should return from the financial sector.
However, on two pages, the sceptics expressed their doubts in terms of the plan.
This is not what the American citizens of us are expected, that the plan will defend the money of the tax paid, as the Californian Republic Darrell Issa.
His colleague of Ohio, Mary Captur said: The measures were made by the same persons, who are also responsible for the Wall Street groups.

Preview of German language spaces
The right camp is intact, only the electors have been in the self-consumed camp - so commented "The Spiegel" the weak performance of the CSU in Bayern.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to control a red black coalition.
The speed (spiegel.de)
In the online output of the left left German newsmagazin, Franz Walter analysises the reasons for the dramatic reduction of the CSU in its article "Bayners Revolution destroys their parents".
In view of the renamed politics, the erosion of the CSU began long before the cruel Beckstein Huber Duo overlooked his people.
Christians have renewed Bayerns over ten years - the modern citizens now turn away from them.
The epoche breast is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merkel.
It was very surprised that the CSU deaster was not, but the Sunday was done something to end, but it has already been a little exit 10 years ago: the uncertainly hegemonie of a State party.
Since 10 years ago, 1998, the CSU was 47.7 percent, and that has first falled under the 50 percent of the marke for the 50s.
This reiterated three years ago at the federal dinner elections in 2005, so still in the many settled Stoiber-Era.
The modernization operated by the CSU in the Federal country has defended its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had pronounced this for 40 years ago, but it was significantly appreciated at the time. However, without effect, the secularization, the success of education, the achievement of east and northern disasters in the promoting regions of Bayerns could not remain on the faith of the CSU warners.
Modernization continues to improve the option, and it has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the electors in the camp were critical and voluntary.
In the past few weeks, the classic citizen groups expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: free professions, worldwide citizens and electors with Abitur as high school conclusion.
Here, the CSU supports even under 40 percent.
The press (depresse.com)
The conservative Wiener Day Time reports in its "Who with whom? Parts retained in coalition questions" articles of the chaotic internal policy situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPE wants to negotiate with the EVP.
The EVP provides the integration of the SPE in internal matters.
The BZE shows it open in all directions for conversations, while the Greeks still not want to determine coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it is about coalition, and in the debates in the public law television, the parties had not seen in their cards.
SPAU-Chef Werner Faymann confirmed his wish to negotiate with the EVP.
The SPE wants to show that cooperation of both parties is very likely possible in some of the US countries and in the social partnership.
The question whether he could present a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current EVP Chaef as a Vicecanzler, has made Faymann open.
As he said, the electors would have chosen the Schüssel-Molterer currency.
A repair of this direction is not in question.
Molterer has therefore reacted carefully on red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitable, but he said that Faymann was trying to enthusiasm the EVP's internal attacks.
Whether its parties are in opposition, or in coalition, are now completely open, and these questions should be discussed by EVP internal.
BZÖ-Chef Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent red black, we're ready to take government response," says Haider.
Járóka: The devil of the poverty and the segregation must be cut off
Today, in Paris, the European Guideline has started the same opportunity as the President of the European Council.
In their discussion on the plenation, Livia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party, notably on the educational organization, since this is one of the most serious legal violations that the Roma-Cineans face, as it is the greatest obstacle to their implementation.
The highranged conference was opened by the French Employment and Social Minister Xavier Bertran on behalf of the French Council Presidency, and Vladimir Spiidla, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, and opportunities.
Between the participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, and the most important European legal and civilian organizations in the field of opportunities.
As the Press office of the EP Members of Fidesz reported, Járkoka noted that, following discrimination in the work search, Rome would first disappear because of their low level of education from the labour market.
"The overwhelming majority of Roma jurisdiction has no media education, and a bad basic education can only reach a small part of them a high school."
Furthermore, Jároka stressed that education is a fundamental human rights to achieve a key role in the provision of other human rights.
Investment in the early training of Roma-Cinders may be able to strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
In view of the Members, it is important that these meetings will be aware of the most wide circumstances of Rome and non-Roma.
Since any Roman scholar starts the school in order to increase its opportunities to be a productive member of the labour market; and through revenue tax and expenditure they provide their contribution to national expenditures.
"If the Union citizens, the Rome has to be secured the right to high quality education - the bad and secreted education must be established" (Livia Járóka).
As described by the Deputy, a common, target and treatment-oriented step is needed to accelerate the disregion process in the education sector. This is unfairly the correct presence of existing and planned anti-discriminatory directives.
"We must help the Devil's crisis from poverty, segmentation and unemployment, and the Romans give the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as a full citizen," invited Járkoka.
Since the Congress in Berlin in the past year, the meeting will be established a unique Forum for the advancement of the goals of opportunity and discriminatory freedom at European but also national level, in the meaning of the "European Year of Justice" .
CSU: Grace for time
Final October will be decided about the shock of the falled Duos Huber-beckstein
Despite the election bathroom, there were no heads, at the side of the Bayernian CSU, the staff debates were delayed.
Particular Erwin Huber and President Beckstein remains in their forces, the question is just how long this grace is.
The 17 percent of the 17 percent of the stimm loss will be decided on the extraordinary party after the catastrophe.
But the very damaged Duo had already been able to see that it wouldn't want to clothe their seals.
To this end, they want to reiterate the strengthened group and the Party Basis, which requested a day after the "Bayerian tsunami" in view of loss of absolute majority of personal consequences.
Fifty years ago, under the leading of Edmund Stoiber, Edmund Stoiber - reached the Christian social Union still 60.7 percent. However, a year after the push against Stoiber could only be 43.4 percent of the voices.
The CSU was 46 years old in Bayern, which produced 18 percent of the German BIP.
Although conservatives remain the decisive force in the Hungary economy of the Southern Federal Economy, it is necessary to rule the future in coalition.
As a first character of the participating internal restructuring, the potential follow-up, Vice-President and Federal Minister Horst Seehofer is also involved in the investigation team leading to the liberal FDP, in relation to the legal "Free elector" sondling parliament on possible Munchner coalition.
One Irony of the Shock Sals is equal to the list of "Free elector" of the Gabriele Pauli enters into the legislature, whose anti-Stuiber retreats the Huber-Beckstein Duo has first defended to keep the animated political manager without dignity.
The CSU management now focuses all its forces on the stabilization of becksteins.
In this transition process, the Stoiber, who has been on the background, has been an active role. The former Minister and the CSU Chairpersons called on 28 September the "bitest day of his political movement".
On Monday, Huber made a few gifted comments in the direction of CDU - his view that the CSU would provide more support from the sister Party.
Other CSU-politicians interpreted the decline as a sign to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has also contributed many to success at national level, does not be put back with a common power effect on the feet, Merkel will not be able to be renewed after federal elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made any heat of her disappearance about Fiasko, believes that the land loss of the CSU will not be negative to the large coalition in Berlin.
However, the damaged CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of social democrates continues.
With 18,6 percent, the SPD reached its best result in Bayern since 1946.
Lukaschenco Option: 110-0
There was no Member of the Opposition to the Ukrainian Parliament's elections on Sunday.
The Russian observers believe that it lies to the well-being and stability of the country conducted by Alexander Lukachenko, the OECD, however, convicts the legitimacy of the votes.
The OECD, who has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognized the elections.
However, the Legislature of the 10 million inhabitants of the Inhabitants has decreased seriously that Lukaschenko, which was elected at the elections of the 2006, has renewed its presidency mandate to the fourth time by some Members of the opposition in the parliament.
This is why the ODS has also taken away from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukrainian is also an increased price for the export of the land gas from Russia, which has been announced economicly, and the country has also enlarged the extension of the Belarus gas, the owner of the russ leading to the country. In the basis of the expectations of the opposition, Ukrainian wishes to improve their relationship with the EU after Lukako and other high-ranging political systems in the EU's anti-democratic abortion.
For a long-term relaxation, the OECD's elections, in which the notice was higher on the positive movements, instead of the decades - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition data from the elections.
However, the rapid report of the OECD has already criticised the campaign - the campaign had not to come in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition in the calculation of the votes had not been present.
Despite all, the opposition can recognize an appeal in the political system: political prisoners have been denied about free foot, and Minsk is even prepared to small confronts with Moscow by continue to recognize the independence of the Affective Georgian province of South-Ocean and Abchasian, although Russia has formed a Federal State on the paper for a month.
"We have made two steps forward and a back, but the most important is that the dialogue between the white and the EU has started", said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our sheet.
In view of the 2006 Oppositionskandide of the presidency elections, it is wishing to continue, although "the powerful forces have been feared, even if they have only been an opposition in the Parliament".
The opposition provides no test measures in view of the results, but it is more trying to clarify the need for economic reform to the electors.
"We have been able to fight with many problems -- the opposite newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us on the rocks in the way, but I see that more people support the change, even the elderly," said Milinkewitsch in playing that not even the biggest damage of the pensionists with the Lukako-Regime, whose only service is the production of social security.
"After the prosecution of the country and the increase of trade deficiency, it is clearly a question of time until the “social security” at the Style of a Peace Court is starting to brush the "social security"," so Milinkewitsch.
In contrast to the opposition policy, Russian observers have called the elections as democratic.
Sergej Libedev, Chief of the Communities Unabhängig States, explained the news agency Ria Novoti: "The people believe the works and not the words." The lack of the opposition is therefore a evidence for the delivery of the whiterus electors.
Brunetta: "To now it is drunk before the work".
The first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are drastic doors for the entrance and exits of the officers.
From this day the measure will enter into force against that slaughter, which are first absolute and then go to coffee drinks during the working time.
The new “Anti-Faulpelz Gesetz” was presented today by Renato Brunetta, the Minister for Public Management and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers.
">"Treshing Tors are a means to increase the employment efficiency by a higher presence rate and more services," Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new medicine of responsibility and transparency starts.
This is reformism again," Brunetta emphasized.
With the Palazzo Chigi, it ends the establishment in all buildings of the presidency of the Ministerial Council.
Masi says, "the choice of the dreamable doors is also of a great symbolic value."
From the sides of officials there was no contradiction, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all those who have come to cooperation from all sides."
So there is no breakfast during the worktime; end with coffee or Croissant .
Brunettas agrees about this with a laughter: "An good capuccino operates wonders at 7:00."
During a meeting of the High Committee of Public Administration (Sculla Supree of Public Administration)
by Rome, the Minister announces that "in half three months the dependences of officials have reduced to 50%, which means 60,000 persons per year more in the work."
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the effectiveness of the public administration of Italy
"Their loan dynamics - such as the ministry - were doubled in the last 8-10 years as the private area and far above the inflation rate."
In addition, thousands of officers have been gathered in order to cooperate with the Brunetta Decree under the Codacons supported vocational training.
"When the Minister for Public Service is profiled with numbers of smaller deficiencies in the work, the consumer centre is written, it increases the people of the 'active training'.
In fact, thousands have been correct and valued officials of the public service to explain the contrary standards of the Decree the war."
In particular, the regional management management (TAR) is fighted for additional financial comparisons for employment disease; the planned extension of the obligationed household of the employer, while the monitoring of the ministry can be examined and other aspects of the renewment of the Minister.
Napolitano: "Aggression against unemployment is crucial"
Every day there was 2500 cases in Italy, three persons died and 27 remain invalid.
For 2007, the data of the Inail (National Institute against employment forces) confirm that the death accidents were about 1200.
These figures are the ground of a phenomenon, which almost doubts so many death cases caused by murder.
Today, the appointment (Association National Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will be held in all provinces of Italy on the 58th National Day for the victims of unemployment in cases to give attention to the social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The concerning governments, distributed by animil data and the tragic news of these days, confirmed the question of prevention at the workplace." The President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in his communication to the President of the Amil (Association National Muilati and Invalidi del Work, confirmed Peter Mercandelli.
The Head of State explains its "growth appreciation for the continuing engagement to prevent jobs, to protect the defended workers, to support the victims families and to sensibilize the public opinion".
The "Basta" has risen on this; it is clearly in tragedys, which are measured in their size regulation, some actives in the media and the participation of the public. However, the general reality is often confronted us with dramatic events that can even repeat in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not prohibite that, in any case, there is a resource problem: it is essential to invest in education and information."
A special importance takes the numerous initiatives to direct awareness in schools on the basis of young people who are close to the work world.
It is our obligation to give attention to this phenomenon and not to disappear from its social desire.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini said: "How the phenomenons of the workers of death cases form an urgent social emergency that regulates all of us and encourages all the institutions to address decision-making rules that have the goal to establish a problem."
"The data of the unemployed cases appear to be easy to signal, but it does not conclude that the number of cases of employed death is too high", said the President of the Employment, Peter Mercandelli.
"We don't want that this "positive tendency" means less attention. That causes tragedy at the end.
"Who thinks that you are too little understood in order to meet the phenomenon of accidents.
Increased controls and inspections are necessary to our view – so Mercandelli; but more measures to clarify the workers that are already starting at school."
"Another effort is necessary - he adds - what is the communication and the sensitivity of the public opinion.
But, above all, a greater responsibility of the workers is asking a phenomenon with a social warming."
Mercandelli also focused on the "continuous disappearance of unemployed protection" and emphasized the "Covering of the social system against which we fight in the past few years.
"The goal is that the employee should pay a guarantee for the insurance to ensure that the victim's victim is not to be voluntary or voluntary dependence decided from time by a legislator. "
Mp3 plastics under complaint: danger of hearing wounds
According to music about a longer time margin with trailable music devices, such as Mp3 pilater, can lead to permanent audiences.
This reports the European Commission, which presents the opinion of the Czerri (Scientary Committee on the current and shortly identified health risks) of the EU today.
"In the report, it is called in a note – it will clear that 5-10% of those who will have at least five years more than one hour in the day, which have been heard with tragible music devices, risking the sustainable loss of their hearing."
"I'm worried about a so large number of youths who usually traged music devices and mobiles on a high volume of their ears without knowing it," said Meglena Kuneva.
"As from the scientific findings -- so it means the Eu – a clear risk is shown to be too fast.
What it really means is to sensibilize the consumers and to do these information on a comprehensive way.
In view of this scientific knowledge, we need to revise the existing control systems to be fully effective and to keep the new technology step.”
Brussels had the independent scientific committee in view of the widely expanded use of the tragible music devices under youth.
"The scientists - the EU's Communication - confirms that you are too properly concerned and that Eu Commission is currently investigating the necessary actions to protect children and youths from dry music devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard that limits the weeping level of transparent music devices at 100 dB. The concerns about the damages that could come from a too large kidney.
These damage can be very limited to solutions such as reduction of the volume and length of the glass position.
In its report, the scientific committee of the Eu shows that if users of traitable music devices only five hours the week (leather than 89 decibel) of music to be overdrawn the legal borders in respect of the maximum wheel on the workplace.
Those who overlook these borders risk the complete loss of the audience within five years.
This is therefore 5-10% of the users of such devices, which can be estimated between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
Rome, Alemanno gives the start board to the "Commission for the future of the capital"
Today, we're going to end in March, the balance will be taken in June.
This is the end established by Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the future of the capital Rome", the Commission took place in the new seat behind the Caracalla therms today.
In six months, the President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the Rom Guidelines.
When the project will be completed, the city and the community Council will assess the analysis and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official" of the Capital and the Supreme Minister of Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural views are presented in it," said, "There will provide proposals for a Rome development plan, which remains politically responsible of the city and the community Council.
There is no refund of competence only the will to have a place where you can develop a great project for Rome.
In March, it will be completed and the Commission will resolve as such a project needs to have a timely endpoint.
In June, the Supreme Minister announced - we will submit the strategic plan that we will use the work made by the Commission."
The Commission's competence is concerned with its views of liability to the German: "All depends on the work that the Commission will provide and depends on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission provides full quality results – and it will certainly be in the case Rome – then it will be its contribution.
The policy is too often occupied with the global problems and emergency situations that have occurred from time.
We, however, want to have a longer period in view of how to work in a deep perspective to the development of Romes and the future of the city."
The Supreme Minister Roms provides a lot of value to precise the following: "This Commission is not an useful institution, nor a wrack: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizen and it will bring us to think. It will be the best head of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "It is necessary to possess a strategic plan, which is not hermetic or statistical to make our city a quality yield - that it really needs to be able to make a common step in the future."
A future, as the Supreme Minister Roms, who are "limited not only in the current communities, but will be seen more", not only in terms of the role of Roms as Metropol and the political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American President?
A known American politician who is a lot to be seen as independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, which was by its decisions, the economy of the U.S. dezimed and made relations with the islam's own islam (and this is still a private man today).
The attacks against Obama will always be stronger, right now where the elections are closed.
A dame from Miami wrote on a Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very fresh: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation, which has seen all two black governors and five black senators!".
However, these attacks do not have a lot to say, but it's the racistic attacks and they don't answer the question of the electors: will he be a good President? And then there are the surveys, and all say that Obama will win with a great prejudice.
In this case, there are people who speak with the heart and not with his head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the southern of the United States, has written in their editorial: we will certainly know who the real American Patriot will give his voice.
There is a mentality of the United States to the experience that has been retained to the latest hidden.
"There is what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our crowds, Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll get out of America.
Something ever heard – just now, where the success of the black candidate seems so safe.
In all cases, despite all these discussions, the final weapons for democrates is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What error started Bush during his official time? 89% replies: the war in Iraq.
America changes.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent to the back home with a trip.
In Iraq, 400 soldiers lost their life, and the Americans were not forced to lay down.
Nevertheless, the Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weakness point.
The one who will take his place is before a huge task.
US. The financial combustion also leaves his springs at journalists: in the newspapers, you can have the shortages. And many of them are accurated of the Internet, the "assassin" of the pressure.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental controls on the future.
Today, almost all journalists are badly worse what happens to their future.
However, they were not really concerned about the information concerning experts because of the general credibility.
You don't feel like alone.
The problem of the American journalists is the money.
The crisis of 2008 is a crisis for these journalists, which has been destroyed.
In addition, the large problems of the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the reactors work to collect the newsroom.
It is a problem that needs to be removed – so the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the large public understands it, it does not significantly shrink.
A clear, but comprehensive Pessimism meets today the American journalist.
Six of ten journalists and executive seniors of pressure are the view that the journalism at national level is the wrong way.
In the local area, there are 65 per cent of the executions.
Printed, etc. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for the journalists to imagine in which direction the web goes.
The most important delay groups speak the way on the Internet, which is viewed by many of the "Killer" of the pressure pressure.
The "Economic pressure" the journalists, has increased up to 79%.
The 500 interview journalists have granted to want to follow the new technology, in the hope "It brings something good for the journalism."
The largest risk is in the American journalism today between the heads of the new room and the reporters working for them.
56% of the headings at national levels are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level only 23 % are at.
Some think it has to do with the " safety in the work".
The operational leaders who fear to lose their work within three years are 47% at national level.
The journalists are 30%.
The topic of the "checking job" in the team (of our "Redakteure", Anm. Red) is always a current subject in the United States.
Only 13% of the journalists are working under the contract.
In a huge nation, such as the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, newspapers, radios and TV warrants and internet drivers, the employees offer as they like and thus will ask them to take or leave it.
The Chef disasters often receive very high oil, which the Redaker can at the same time receive only 10000 euros per month, as well as payment and insurance steelers.
The vacation will therefore be complexed: a certain amount of days in the first year, so many after the third, to finally reach a number of 15 years of holidays.
But the American journalists will be, like they themselves, often "sat in the year".
It's a question of climate.
UNIPOL: GERICHT IM ROM: COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GROTTAFERRATA
The Chairman of the Second Court of Justice in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estatemaker, which was requested to be granted by Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola because of the bankrot in the context of the Convention Agreement in the case of the transfer of Unipol Bnl.
During the process against him during the week, his release from the household was converted to a stay obligation to Grottaferrata.
His advocates Michele Gentloni and Gaetano Pecorella were requested to allow the real estatemaker to be delivered from the province city to a apartment in the capital.
According to the Court, the delegations (which who had spoken the State authority) could give him the possibility to affect his society and to reach the evidence material to him.
Elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already shown a few days before the Deputy Chamber against the 700 billion dlar Sparat of the white house. It was a large part of the Americans and is more interested to save the Wall Street than the economy.
This confirms the earliest editions of the New York Times, which reported about how the crisis in the transit the republic party continued to split more in its old and moderate East Coast Seel, which continued to benefit from the State institutions and the business community, and that new reservative, the "thean in Washington" and the financial world, and, in the southern and the center of the States of electoral.
This part of the party thanks its rise to the voice I mentioned above.
This example mentioned, therefore, is only a small part of the major changes that announces the current agricultural land or even already shown: not only in the United States, nor even in the whole western, and may also be concerned over this.
Although in the countries and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long feared events that have finally been adopted in these new conditions and come to light.
The first of this phenomenon is the new discovery, the unorganized renaissance of the State in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decrease of the bank and financial institutions that are closely linked to the foreign and also managed to an unlimited amount of private households living in a single State.
This means a direct political problem for the Governments, which is how to maintain the family concerned, which also represent a huge electoral mass.
The crisis, therefore, seems to be globally globally, politically, is almost clean national.
Political internationalism seems to be so delighted and lost his real right: the unique evidence is given by the EU to know that, due to its division in various national and international conflicts, there is no way to find a common way.
Therefore, all of them are more seriously accepted by the attack of the State; rescue plans, new rules, and e.g. the distribution of aid fund: Since the crisis has been always more serious, only the United States in the economic situation, without foreign assistance.
In addition to the resources, they also have to use the légitimation of these: therefore, two not to overvalue conditions – under certain circumstances – which may not be able to restore any international organization or market in a similar manner.
Any new impression set on the national element is, however, in perfect agreement with the most important importance recently involved in the economy with a widely affected sector: the territoriality.
Paradoxerly, it is just now when we were so convinced to be in an enlarged whole kingdom, in a kingdom of the always different technologies, the immature, that we need to determine as our future is still more than the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
However, all of them can be transported by a place to the other of the world, but they are most outstandingly connected to an outer part of the earth – a territorium.
As a result, the one who has such a territory is in the benefit of the benefit of a free area in an infringent, waterless or oil-related area.
I now come to the second news, but it is a short deal.
Who Territorium, who government, who politics say, also tells leadership.
In this regard, the financial crisis seems to produce two competitive phenomena.
On the other hand, the knowledge is about the need for leaderships, so the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other side, there is now a wave of the inflation of the existing leadings, i.e. those of the economy, which have disappeared as inadequate and full shadow zones.
Finally, a deeply rich and in some sense is still inconsistent: a loss of confidence, a doubleness, a image of inevitability, a feeling of the television, which is all a class of managers of the Western countries.
It seems that the conviction among the major parts of the population is the way that it is not only the acts of the social Elite but already their ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the sense of the word, whose maintenance is always stranger and overcoming.
The demand for leadership is therefore nearly a deteriorated but powerful movement of the disappearance of the leading class and the original political stability. This is shown in unprecedented "Revolts" of the elector and indirectly reproach of the collective state of the last time: starting with the increase of conservatives in Austria and Bayerns, on the coherence of the Labour Party in Britain, on the rebellion of the American Orders against Bush (and perhaps also plays you of the rights in Italy).
The impression, as the old Elite, its parties, their programs, but also their laws, newspapers, intellectual believers, some would say their format, always more understanding problems and therefore less representative values concerning what is today in the underlying social areas of the West and is still strengthened from the financial crisis and the overdimensionality.
Besides all of them, it would be easy to speak of a "rebellion of the Mass".
But keeping your eyes far open, it isn't sure.
The Superkletter that allows moving on the walls
The forces of the weak force through an aggregate substance and can be able to be high-level walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, which seems likely to be achieved at the goal.
With a clothed clothes on a surface of only 2,5 qcm is able to fix a 100 kg hard body on a simple wall.
The STUDIO – a American magazine has published the results of the researchers of the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material found by the Research team is a further development of the already used clothing materials that use a special coal structure called carbon nitrogen.
"The Principe of the Cleaner can be presented as a series of stories designed to a stapel Spaghetti," said Zhong Lin Wang from Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have inspirated themselves from the feet of the Geckos, covered by microscopic heats that make a perfect stop to the animal.
The tests carried out with different materials such as the glass Teflon and the slope paper have shown that the new clothing is ten times more strong than the stopability of the feet of the reflits and even the "success from the wall," Liming Dai, researchers of the Ingenieur Sciences of the University of Dayton.
ON MAUERN ENTLANGWANDERN? "This material could be used as a luggage material", sets Liming Dai.
Is it possible that the researchers are thinking about a less featuring benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanors are also leaders of warmness and electricity.
Another application areas could fall in the area of space.
So the Superhelds need to wait for the moment.
The University of Berkeley, California, of the University of California, is a new clothes.
In a article of the American Chemical Society, the California scientists present a climb of microphasers who clean as hairs on a surface itself from the powder and thus keep a perfect portrait.
Medicinal: Never use of fruit
Consideration of graffred, horn and aptellith.
These drinks that are consumed in the summer in their competitive quality, and in the summer, can be produced severe health damages if they are taken together with certain vital medicines, as they can affect the recovery of them by the body in extreme manner.
David Bailey, Professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, reiterates the risk of embedded and fresh fruits in connection with medicine rehabilitation. In the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he reiterated warning: It enjoys a glass Apfel, or graffin assets, to reduce the recovery of certain vital medicines so far that these are practical and so the health of patients.
Graphic acids were already defended to be responsible for the effects of some medicines like antibiotics, antiathematics, heart crystals, anxiolytics and neurological resources to increase to toxic levels.
MEDIKAMENT IN GEFAHR – This medicinal agent had been drunk in a report two years ago doctors and patients before the dangers of this mixed, and emphasized to see what was drunk in connection with means such as diacepan or metadon.
ES NICHT NUR GRAPEFRUIT – In accordance with the experts, the oranguth and the aggregate substances that can admit the medicinal products.
The list of active materials collected by the fruits is long.
As a result, the Appell by Michele Carruba, the Director of the University of Statale di Milano: "Solch results are usually directed to various international producers which are so free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended to read the package condition and, if there are non-declarations to ask any apotheker or doctor," the experts of the Ansa agent noticed.
Economic nobel price goes to Paul Krugman
The economic nobel price is to the American Paul Krugman for its analysis of trade furniture and the accommodation of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeysian who learned the University of Princeton and known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most criticians of the Bush Administration policy.
For months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the day of the Enron Communities Bruch, Krugman confirmed in a leadership of New York Times, that this second event was more important for the history of the United States than the attention.
A precaution that has not been a little Polemic as an answer and has been stopped for the economy and years later, but today it has been completely cleared.
"I'm surprised and also shocked about how fast the memory of the skandals in the framework of the Enron or Worldcom Com Com Com Com Com Com Com summon has been shot out of the public area," said Krugman end 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the European Central Bank's Executive Committee, Krugman is a "economic of great value", but also an analysis with a "more aggressive style, which is particularly contrary to the extreme liberalism of Bush government".
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft Package"
The day of publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 is arrived; the open source is providing as free replacement for Microsofts Office a larger number of users, both at home and in the office, both under free and in public administration.
After an intensive year of work by the voluntary developers who are monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now present with some news to the public: besides a processed and now developed spanish start menu, it is finally one of the reasons for secured compatibility with Apples operating system Mac OS x and the support for the new ODF (Open Document format) 1.2, so the new standard ISO format, which is the new standard version.
Furthermore, the compatibility of Microsofts Office 2007 has been read by OpenOffice's new formats (.doache, .xlsx, .ptx).
Interests are also some new features, such as those that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, such as the sending via email. This includes the possibility to import PDF files in graphical processing modules and to keep the original appearance of the page.
Now, the "hybride" PDF files can be generated that extension the typical graphics of Adobe format for the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of applications: tables can now be processed more than different users, which prevent conflicts in changes; in the case of the text processing system, each employee will demonstrate a phrase to ensure such a better correction procedure.
Some companys are now to publish various functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud) while the final result is to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link to: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. It follows the English version that is on Friday.
External for Windows and Mac OS is also available for the Linux operating system.
You can send the installation CD to home or to the office.
The freedom of costs may also be an approximation for the dissemination of the programme in private house, so it is also just in the field of business where OpenOffice could be available: finally, various public management and school institutions have already been translated to OpenOffice.
In fact, it doesn't even miss a training offer which means an optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus also opens business perspectives.
OpenOffice sets out five main files: writers, the Word's relevant text set-up program; Calc, the table program on a destruction of Excel;print, for the creation of representations such as powerpoint; the base for the use of databases instead of the known access; and last Draw, a graphic module.
The objective for the 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can also be easily overcome at this time at 3 million and 600 thousand.
The fourth Doping case also shows positive cohl
A new Doping case is opened at the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian Sporter Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is a third classified team and winner of the best clerk.
The message published the daytime The Team on its website.
The 26-year-old cool of the team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver who was dedicated to Cera, the Epo of the third generation. Before it was found at the Italian Riccò Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schoumacher.
The analysis of the blood tests are those who have been operated in the last weeks of the Labors Lesanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
To confirm the countermeasures now the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and exclude the rail for two years.
Head of the French Antidoping Committee Peter Bordry confirmed the positive Epotest, and reported the Associated Press as well as the Austrian experts.
The 26-year-old Austrian grew up after the Spanish Carlos Saster and the American Cadel Evans on the podium and also encouraged the Trikot of the best Clerk for himself.
THE MARKER: IT AND THE TO THE FRAGT: IST ITALIES RASSISTIES?
Italy, "the other countries of migrants have become a short of one of the preferred immigrant countries, which are only taken with oppressions.
Do this from Belarus a nation of rassists? This asks the New York Times in a long article that has been granted to the whole theme of racism in Italy and from the case of the young Burkina Faso is Abdul William Guibre, who was killed a month ago in Mirand after he had slain a package.
The case is aware of what the Times are called "Paradox of the north", the North regions are those in which "the most integration and employment opportunities" exist, and however "the highest degree of anti-immigration senses and the greatest support of Lega's north".
As a confirmation of growing space between Italian and immigrants, the times are called on further episodes of the intolerance of Miland, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just that.
The new laws imposed by the Lega against immigration and the faster instruction of the illegal immigrants will be made as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A move that also underlines the Pope and the State President: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Papst at a meeting on the Quirinal to cooperate between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Student victims of up to 900 euro per room high food price
The market for students does not know crises.
According to the last investigation of Sunia, the Middle Agency, a student can cost up to 900 euros in Mailand, 700 in Florence, 650 in Neapel and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomen has already been very seriously accepted. All students' samples are in fact losing their right to study because their families are not in a position to support them at this level" (such as the responsible of Sunia, Laura Mariani – “in these cities leads the great demand of students to a deformation of the market, which also caused the other inhabitants.
Moreover, most offers include a number of distortions: free contracts, lack of registrations, without food price limits, unlimited submissions.
Sunia is the need for extraordinary measures that lead to low food prices through reforming the taxation.
In a precise review of the investigation, it indicates that in Milana there is a bedroom in the quarter of Brianza about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in quarter of the Nere bands) and ends with 800 euros in the quarter of Lambiate, Udine and Fiera, or almost 900 euros in the Vittoria quarter.
In Florence, a bed room costs average 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the quarters around the University, are 250/280 euros for a bedroom of nuts, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the quarters are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bedroom in a double room.
Only less the food in the quarters are the other Universitys of Rome: 550 euros in Eastern and Citizenship.
Only those who are in the outdoor office can spend money: 300 euros for a bedroom and 450 euros for a single room in Presestina, Center cells and similar quarters.
In Neapel, you need 300-450 euros for a bedroom, for a room, the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the darkest quarters, polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a bedroom is 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the stedical economy.
In the cities in which the phenomenome of the residence of external European students is often more than near Perugia, there is even another anonymal: a meat that is about 25-30% over the average, is requested by foreign students.
To reveal the old Kino Paradiso – the cities close their historical kinosals
The historic knees close from the favorite multiplexkinos.
"A city without knoasol is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This image of the Register Joseph Tornator describes with effect what happens at the large city centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of the knoos, which started with the birth of the great multial complex in Perifer, is long-term meaning the death for the uncalkino in the center. A process that appears not only inaccessible and inevitably, but also brings a cultural crime.
The recorder of the film "Neovo Cinea Paradiso", which used the Oscar and the Great Price of Cannes before 20 years ago. It is to live in a history of a prestitkinos and the nostalgie that consists of the film.
The numbers of anec, which provides the central Water Trade, speak a clear language: in the last five years, they have to close the amount of 316 traditional knees; these censes payed mostly the knoos in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Miland, Neapel, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The Emilia-Romagna's most strongly affected regions include 82 lost knoos, followed by Toskana with 44 and Lombardei.
This is aware that the main offenders are the multiplexkinos, because they are just these three regions in which the largest number of these modern knoos has been registered: with 195, Lombardei leads the lists in the last five years, 81 are in Toskana and in the Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," Paul Protti, President of the Anec, "is nutably that new structures are also provided, but first place is the sustainment of the already existing, because a hall in the city is not ready to find all his tribes instead of a multiplexkino in Periferia.
And here remains the lack of food for the Foundation of the Waterband outward eight: the debt charge marked by the State is approximately 10 million euros.
It is a shame of the ethical-moral position that the government does not respect the existing laws.
To obtain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be in the year of Nate."
It is interesting in the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which decided to protect them by a convention between the community and the anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, which aims to protect and support the traditional knoos, and that in the historic centre, as well as in Periferia.
Under the previous measures, tax provisions for the Kino operators and benefits for the public on food transport are also allowed to go through the centre's licensed areas and also park to more favourable park costs.
"It's a happy initiative," Joseph Tornator, "I hope that other cities will be closed to our example and that there are also new concepts.
However, we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to make something against the supermacht of the multi-balance trees, because finally it is the public from today.
The defense of the traditional kino was a very important topic for me: the closing of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the proposed point that brought me to found the "Neovo cinema Paradiso" even though I had played with the thought for 10 years.
Since 25 years I live in Rome; if I'm on the rialto or on the Quirinal in the Via National, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side to see the dust places.
Relations between policy and Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the citizen of Joia Tauro
"The citizen of Joia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Mafia Group Piromalli.
The complaints of the lawyer of the Antimafia-Autority of Kalabrien against the citizen Giorgio Dal Torrione and his representative Rosario Schiavone of the municipality Joia Tauro, who have been arrested this morning for the development in Mafia jobs.
Joacchino Piromalli, the former Condemnator between the Clan and the public manager, and its Neffe: the lawyer who leads the same name as the boss of the Clan has already been condemned in criminal agreements of the Mafia, at the same time to a disappearing sum of 10 million euros.
"Every kind of moral and legal standard missilely," the applicants write, "the two local administrations decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for advice activities."
"Therefore the Mafia group was possible – so the judges – to engage on official path to the ratios and to agree the public management policy."
The President of the Regional Committee of Calabrin Agazio Loiero does not denial that it is "all others than one exception to move in connections with local administrations and organized crime." "There are places in which the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others, in which such connections are practically unrealised.
But there are also local politicians that face the pressure of the Ndrangheta: the heroes that get a white Western."
The arrests of this morning follow them from the past July, with which the police of Clan Piromalli has been resolved.
Since the end of April, the Communities Council of Gioia Tauro was solved, however, in 1991, and at the same time, on the basis of a vulnerable connection between organized crime and local management, local politicians were enthusished.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, at the same time Master of the Udc, has been elected after the selection from May 2006 to the head of the Middle Right Coalition.
He cried as the prefector assigned the resolution of the Communities Council.
He was interested in the Vice-Minister Marco Minniti, which he was interesting to find everything from political-Strategic reasons, but the judges explain in relation to the Hof Command of Tomorrow that the Piromalli Clan had even desired to make a change in the A3 project.
From a vote in the case of Dal Torrione’s investigations, the need to meet the desires of a undertaking, which is known to a representative of the large group on the Piromalli, and the measures of the public management have been the same with the interests of this clan."
When energy is gone out of the wheels, the largers suddenly run
It is a non-covered money source that covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and now it seems to take the great energy persons of the world.
Welles, smokes and times are the new renewable energy sources that are now all looking for, and also seek to accumulate, such as leaders like Chevron.
The possibility of gain energy from the movements of the sea has been taken into consideration for 70 years; these studies are not intensived since the first wood crisis.
When the oil price over 1980 is affected, the idea of the marine energy is decrease, but now the environmental organizations and the increased oil prices are reduced to new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world's energy supply could be covered by the ocean forests.
This is equal to the double of the current energy produced by nuclear powers.
Furthermore, the sticks and time are still coming.
Guide at attack.
The first company currently put on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract for the establishment of a vehicle in North Portugal.
When this message was published, it seemed to act a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are still more firms from traditional energy sectors that set on marine energy performance.
"Chevron studies these technologies" – the speaker of one of the United American leading companies in the Wall Street Journal – and would have the opportunity to cooperate with us. "
This is the aim of establishing a approval of the American Energy Committee, which is necessary to start a project before the coast of Alaskas.
This is not to be sustainable, e.g. if you think that it is actually helping oil through the United States and that the Bush's plans were put in shortly first in the Gang.
Besides Chevron, the company Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey who invest into the new industry; also are not known for the details that observers speak of an increased interest.
Another improvement technologies.
Experts speak of one still founding technology, which is not last, since the latest doubts of the environmental defenders are not cleared.
Furthermore, projects such as in Portugal and Scottland are higher smaller size and there are no serious environmental problems to be caused.
However, in order to produce energy in a large measure table, technologies need to be greater impact on the environment.
There are different possibilities: Ocean Power uses a system of associated bows.
The bottle of the waves, which moves the bows down, is converted in the throat on colbs and cylinders in hydraulical pressure.
This includes a tournament that takes back a generator.
The fuel is sent to the coast through underwater guides.
Until now there are four planned installations of this type that are still waiting for the State approval. A part of the energy gained could also serve for military institutions.
Verdant Power has already produced energy for a good buy house and a parklace with subsequent tourbines in the East River of New York.
The water movement during the time includes the tourbines that have expensed the generator through the outcoming dry movement.
According to Verdant, a long blow of possible clients is already waiting for the necessary authorisations to use these energy sources.
First of the waves, then the times.
A special interest is given to the Institute for Strom Winter Research in view of the potential that is in time.
Although it is a non-regular phenomenon, the time is better prerequisite than wind-strooms, the sun-instruction and the forests, and therefore a more reliable source of fuel.
In fact, the current energy is that US States such as New York, Maine and Alaska have been investing for $7.5 million in 2008 – for 2009 have already been planned up to 35 million.
