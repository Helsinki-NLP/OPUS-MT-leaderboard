Barack Obama will be the fourth United States President that receives the Nobel Prime of Peace
The United States President Barack Obama will reach Oslo, Norway to take 26 hours and receive the First Nobel of the Peace, as the Fourth American President of the History.
The diploma, media and the cheque of $1.4 million will, inter alia, receive them by the exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among the nations.
Head of the White House and his wife Michelle will come to the northern metropolis in the morning and will have much to do.
First, you have visited the Nobel Institute, where the five members of the Committee will first be found with him between 172 persons and 33 organizations.
Afterward, the presidency has planned a meeting with the King of Norway, Harald V, and the Queen Sonia.
In the late, the visit will be collapsed with a ceremonie where Obama will receive the prestigious galardón.
It will be the fourth United States President, who receives it, although the third who receives it in his charge.
The White House has already announced that, when received the prize, he will speak about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that it is received the prize as President of a country currently in war in two countries.
His efforts to war have still increased with the send of additional soldiers to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of its criticisms.
In the ceremonie, Obama will also receive gold, diploma and cheques of ten million swiss crowns (approximately 24 million cheque crowns).
It is proposed to give them charitable purposes, but it has not yet decided to what organization is.
During its complete programme, the Chairman and his wife will participate in a bank to attend, including the Norway Kings, the first minister and other 250 invited.
Obama from the beginning had a more reserved attitude towards the prize.
He said, for example, to have the sense of not merit him of all.
Furthermore, he repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values.
Immediately after the announcement, he reported that it represents "related to take actions".
Defender of the nature accused of driving
Litom's police accused the Chairman of the Civil Association Společnost alsoráncs Pírody Litom月ice (Litom dieself).
In the past year, he had appealed several times against the licensing procedures of construction licenses and to retire appeals requested investors money for their own benefit, confirmed the carrier of the Litom's police of Alenice Romová.
The President of the Society Defenders of the Natur Litom月ice is Lubomír Studnička.
Currently he is detained and has been sentenced to a sentence of up to three years of prison.
In Brno you don't like containers too much to separate the ball
In Prague, citizens can separate drinking emblems and in the southern villages of Moravia can be found containers to separate grounds everywhere.
And in Brno?
There you need several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to confirm that in Brno isn't going to get the bottle.
I think that, for the second largest city of the Republic, the meetings are not sufficient for this problem.
Brno is totally stretched in the separation of baths, not only because we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, visual and plastics, but especially for the number of containers for these residues.
Did you ever test, for example, put a PET bottle to the appropriate container in the centre?
It is almost impossible, above all, to require a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found until now is on the Moravské place nam's, earlier of the Potrefena Huse.
That is not with me Mr. Undka and his fellows, but it seems too little to me.
It doesn't have to mention that in other parties it is not easy to separate the bathroom.
That's why many of my friends prefer to not separate it.
For vagance
What happens is that the containers are far away.
Don't surprise me.
I myself offered, after a feast, to throw a few vidry and plastic bottles.
But in the Calle Kaunicova I saw no red container near.
Unfortunately, I'm going to the transcript I found the right place.
However, the bottle was already rebounded from the container.
It continues to be the centre of Brno, the most representative of the city, isn't it?
What happens is that ecology and ethnics are not too interesting to Brno socialists.
They prefer to buy you to the city the extract of hockey, which is confusing us in all the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno may be cleaner.
I'm glad you can compare my hypothesis, after shipping by Internet a little, with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM society, Brno is actually the worst of all the region of Jihomoravský.
The Portabek Budget took money from income and disease subsidies
After the left, despite the view of the government, add funds for farmers or officials, the budget may not have enough money for income, disease subsidies or construction supply.
But neither for the interests of the State or international debt.
This will cause all those who govern in the second half of the year coming, says the Minister of Hacienda Eduard Janota.
When socialdemocrats and communists imposed the increase in some groups, it was aware that the Government was expected to ask a loan for sensitive, income or income of diseases. "This requires only to fix the problems for the future, it is to colocate mines," says Janota.
What happens is that, when money is taken, we need to pay higher interests and, some day, we must return the money.
The State has no many options to get money.
If not reduce the social subsidies or operational costs of the State, the tax must be increased.
To all who had added the left now: bombers, teachers, farmers.
And, later, also to her children.
People do not have to worry about the income or subsidies of disease, they will receive them. Of these accounts they disappeared 1.800 million.
But the price to pay will be the increase in public debt; the year that comes will not be lacked in the treasure only 163.000 million but more.
Despite the efforts of the Minister of Janota, debt will continue to increase together with interest costs.
The State shall need money to cover it and will no longer increase HIV or reduce maternity subsidies, as the Government has done in its package against deficit.
Following money dislocations for some elector groups, the year that is coming will also lack five thousands to end the construction of self-employment and railways.
It is, above all, of the sectors in which the training has already been held and where the construction process has already started, whose projects cannot be changed and can not be reduced.
The least you can do is keep them, whatever is not free.
This means long or end of the thirty large constructions; the possibility of reaching European funds is also in danger, announce the carrier of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
◆SSD proposed a salony solution for decrease of funds: it will obtain money from the dividers of the EZB, which is mostly property of the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the division is never safe, nor is a backless sack.
The past year of the EEC was 18,000 million.
Each year of the divisions are liquided ecological damage, they serve to complete the account for revenues or serve as a reservation for the preparation of revenue reform.
Furthermore, in accordance with the EU rules, the real deficit of the budget at 5,7% of the PIB has increased.
The carnaval of money transfers does not end here.
Approximately three thousand million were obtained from the budget to grant a number of compensations to the victims of communism and crimes, or for litigate expenditures, including in the construction furniture.
It is not clear if the State will need these funds.
It's a lotery.
If we lose some international license, we may have to pay it, Janota says.
Afterward, the Minister must provide money in the resort or, in the worse cases, earn the reserve of the Government budget.
There are also hundred million for the Statute Polardin project (Statland Chamber) whose price is of two million and that has already been started. It should be allowed to monitor online in which different authorities are earned.
The first stage begins in January.
If the Main Minister does not find money on the other side, the project will have to stop and get sanctions, advise Janota.
Your future intelligent phone can function with two operational systems
The United States will contain a mobile phone in which the user can, by clicking a key, change between several operational systems.
The discovered plans are promotors.
With just clicking a key, they go through a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
This possibility is the objective of the US company VMware, which focuses on the development of virtualising software for computers.
In your mobile, two user profiles can be brought to the time.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
The two work at the time, said Mr.inivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company interview for the computer reviewworld.
It was presented in November of the past year and a few days had been first demonstrated.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of intelligent phones is no fiction.
VMware has already shown successfully the journalists how the smartphone works with two operational systems.
It was Nokia N800, modified with a RAM memory of 128 MB, where the mentioned systems work, Windows Mobile and Android, now.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in your support.
VMware company collaborates with European and American operators to make smartphone virtualization tests and these phones will come to customers during 2012.
The lack of snow on the mountains is worried to hotels
Not only teleschure holders in Krkonoše are worried about the pistes without snow.
The lack of snow makes people not book ski ski ski ski ski stands in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Kkeronoše can still be obtained free rooms for all the winter dates, including Nochebuena and Nochevija.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but still have fear of booking with commitment.
And if you call us, ask us immediately about our opinion, if these Navys will be snow or bar," she reported the computer portal Sprindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to pass in μpindlerav Ml show a Nochevian according to their expectations, should not more be kept in booking the stay.
Those who prefer to assess money and make the quality of accommodation in second place, may try to wait for more days.
>>yid<<pindler's hotels from Mlhow offers all weekly stays for Nochevian.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will stop and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be selled quickly, Jandura decided.
Ingotors, a Vrchlabi Travel Agency, continues to offer free beds for all the winter dates.
Now whatever interests us is the shipping week, which is not yet complete.
The half of the offered places remains free.
That is why we have already prepared some shipping stays last time," said the director of Ingtours Peter Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi Travel Agency can also offer Nochevija in Kkonoše, but there are less free places.
The first fourteen February days are also selled, the remaining invernic data are regularly selled.
This year the interest in the winter stays is threatened by the lack of snow in Kklonše.
People are waiting for seeing if he's naked.
Nobody wants to pass the end of the year on the mountain without snow.
If the pysts remain naked during the week, the date of Christmas will also be expired," opina Schiefert.
On the other hand, it is a little easier to take the rooms in the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Snćkou; the past year was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For Nocheviah and Christmas, we have the last free places.
The interest increases during the polar holidays in January and February also sells well," informed the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
The eightth percent of the Nochevian stays are also busy in the Omnia hotel, near the central parking in Janské Láznć.
On the other hand, the half of the beds is still free at Janské Lázn in Navidad.
This January was a great surprise for us, since we found approximately a sixty percent of the occupation capacity.
Febrero has been a little more weak, but as the snow snow snow, the interest for the stays in Kklonše will certainly increase, mentioned Erik Sporysch, the Omnia hotel director.
However, at the moment, it seems that the Kkonoše hotels will pass the snow gains in waiting for them.
The Thursday must fall temperatures and, if there are precipitations, the mountains should be black.
But afterwards the temperatures will again be sustained, she informed Jakubský of Hradec Králové, the Hydrometeological Institute of the Czech Republic.
EEA: Recurrence is the mother of wisdom
It is economic that Barack Obama, the President with the reputation of the most intelligent man, as a careful student reflected in the matter, affects the strategy of his predecessor, which he himself took by the most tolerable.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, waiting with care, it was shown that it is a copy of the guide used for Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text, it is used several times as "elective as in Irak", but that he did not be empty in the title of the Bush declaration of January 2007 for its own statement: "A new path forward."
He was himself who criticed the idea of Bush to send new military encouraging to Iraq, the country that is suffering by civil war, and that criticed it as "unreasonable decision and with catastrophic consequences".
Nevertheless, the following months have shown that Bush's strategie, based on the Field Capital Reviews, was the only possible and outcome, so that today nothing of Iraq was spoken today in the news.
The reputation of Bush did not improve, however, objectively left its successive initial situation a lot more favourable than it could be waited.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama is expected to repair the miracle.
The field captains returned to ask him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander of the Afghan general operation Stanley McCristal. He, even though the traditional relations underordined, submited to the uncertain flowers in the White House to a sustainable criticism.
He asked 400,000 men to improve the situation.
The Chairman was driving for three months, but it was nothing better to happen, so at least he stumbled the general over 100,000 military.
He achieved Europe to promise other 5.000, even though he previously contained at least 100,000.
The most problematic of all Obama strategy seems to be its goal, starting back to Afghan troops in 18 months and ending this procedure in three years. All Obama's teaching had more questions of the responses he offered.
Many doubts that increase gives the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite pregnant wars in the past years, the company of Iraq is relatively organized, their leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is possible to fill no one and no agreement is fulfilled.
Besides these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, if they are accompanied to change head every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, though formally established, will continue to be a people of Potemkin, and after it the parental tribal relations will remain.
Equipation of the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinaryly complicated because of the confused relationships, even more complex from Pakistan and Iranian influences.
Even establishing a state that is "action capability", a minimum goal of all operations, seems very real.
The horizon of the Obama Schoca strategy for its voluntary.
During the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to begin and now is at the point of steel.
Only a Romantic soul, which doesn't know anything about the reality, can believe that the military sent to the war to "retreat at home," they will make some wonder here.
From the political point of view, fixing the date of the retirement of the troops is pureless, since the Talibans will consider it as an indirect declaration of the United States disappearance.
The last summit of OTAN showed that Europeans are always less desired to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, and they don't want to explain their electors, what is the security of Germany or Italy with the war with Hindu Kush.
The other factor, which is able to affect radically the situation, is the development of the events in Iran.
If the situation continues to undermine and increased sanctions do not have any effect on Iran, the United States will have to take a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
The responses will be needed precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triunfly retired from the Afghan troops.
However, each solution will mean a dramatic revision for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years lacking for presidency elections and therefore there is still a long time to find another strategy, if it is a total fraction.
Goldman Sachs bank directives will not receive the in effective bonuses
The U.S. Executive Highs of the US Bank Goldman Sachs will not receive the bonus in effect this year.
The entity announced it to reaction before the hard critical of its wages practices.
The group of 30 high directives shall receive actions that cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
Moreover, actions may be removed in the case of excessive risks.
According to the Reuters Agency, Goldman Sachs became so leader in the efforts to join bonus in Wall Street with long-term power.
I guess Wall Street is fully aware of the longest way it must be imposed, mentioned the former investors of the JPMorgan Douglas Elliott entity.
The problem is in details, added.
The Goldman Sachs bank focused on the critics after approximately 17.000 million dollars (cay 300,000 CZK) for bonus, in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonus in the entity for this year, according to the Reuters Agency, probably exceed, despite the stated measure, $20,000.
The prices in the bank sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a delicate issue in the policy.
Great Britain announced the middle planned to think of one time, with an taxation of a 50 percent, the bonus for bankers over 25.000 libraries (approximately 712.000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
Women received the Nobel Premies in all the least physical categories this year.
Five women, which is a recorded cipher, were received today in the King Carlos XVI Gustatus of Sweden the first Nobel of this year, in specialized categories and literature.
Besides the four scientists, he also set a German writer of Roman origin, Herta Müller.
It was two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as his partner Jack Szostak for research in the chromosome.
The Nobel in Chemical received the Israeli Ada Jonath and the United States Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for the explication of the structure and function of ribosoms.
The last delivered premium, the First Nobel of Economic, received the United States Elinor Ostrom and his partner Oliver Williamson by the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a pregnant woman, was physic.
This prize received it today by the research in the area of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD Chip, which represents the basis of all digital, faxes or telescopes.
Each premium collected the diploma, the media of Nobel and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is from up to ten million snow crowns (approximately 25 million cheque crowns).
In the case of a number of premiums in each category, the prize is repaired to each other.
The traditionally hoped Nobel, the Peace, received it today afternoon in Oslo, Norway, American President Barack Obama.
In his discussion, he recognized the dispute that it was premised, as it was the principle of his road and also is the head of a country participating in two wars: in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend its policy, however, added that wars in some situations are impressive to achieve peace, although their price is high.
Minister Janota considers the mission. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday onmorrow to the Minister of Appeal Eduard Janota, which is planning its stay in the government, since it is not agreed with the version of the State Budget for the year which it comes, adopted the Middle of the Deputy Chamber.
The budget should be proposed, and perhaps the remaining of Janota in the garden, will be the items of its Saturday meeting.
The budget is also critical by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, and the crisis of public financing remains deep.
On the citate, he informed the port of President Radim Ochvat.
On his stay in the role, Janota wants to negotiate lunch with the first Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of 163,000 coronas.
However, the Chamber of Deputy adopted the left proposals for fund transfers and increased money for staff, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government is not agreed with the proposals of social democrats, since they are closely enhanced the budgetary deficit.
Among the left side and the government, Claus and the right by the other, a serious conflict of internal policy has been made. In the context of this conflict, they began to be counted by the future activities of the fisher's bourgeograph, whose form was agreed in primary time by the ODS, μSSD and the Party of Greens.
Criticals claim that the budget, in the version adopted by the Chamber of Deputy Chamber, has actually liquided the package of abortional measures imposed by the fisher Government to cut public defence.
Klaus may but has not to sign the State Budget Law; it has stated today during a disappearance with enterprises that politicians have led a long time by avoiding "the serious problem", i.e., "not sustainable deficit" of the public career.
As he today has no good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported in a broader consensus between political parties, could improve this situation, believe the President.
The leader of ODS Mirek Topolanek said that the budget is sharp and that the government should think of its future existence.
The Vice-President of ODS, Petr Nečas, said to ◆TK that the concept of the burocratic shipping with support of 周SSD, ODS and the Greens are obviously not working.
The first Minister Fischer reacted and calified similar words of "which senses".
The Chief of 周SSD, Jií Paroubek, reacted to Topolanek to say that the deficit of the budget is spanish, prepared for this year by former government of Topolanek. It will overcome the 20 million crowns.
The Middle-SSD said that the approval of the State Budget for the coming year was completed.
The populars were also content.
Manage it in the new film of Clint Eastwood, interpreted by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Inventable, refers to the country, its fight and its victories, although some criticals say that the protagonist roles play the American actors.
The story speaks of the sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The incansable fight against the racistic apartance regime in the South African Republic and its first Black President, Nelson Mandela, is interpreted in its biographie by the United States Actor winner of a Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Mandela, 91 years old, asked him to interpret him in Eastwood film.
Another important role plays Matt Damon.
I said to her, "When I interpret it, I'll have to have access you.
The actor of seventy-two years, who received the prize for his role in Eastwood's drama on the world of the Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of the slave, which was made to be a slave, of the President of the United States, and even of God in Evan Allpoderoso. But he rarely represented someone who remains alive and, for many people, is so important as Mandela.
The former South African state has been in prison for its activities to end the apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years he became President of the country.
In 1993, the first Nobel of the Peace was received.
Invictus - Invencible is a Latin word and the title of a poem of English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The network was talking to him.
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, which joined his forces with the Captain of South African rugby team, Francois Pieiner, to help join the country. Mandela, the new President, knows that after apartment, his nation remains racial and economicly divided.
It believes that it is able to join his people through the sport, and therefore it is decided to join rugby players, who are in the world-wide measure of outsiders.
South African teams enjoys reaching the World Copa in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's history to the cines.
I had no other purpose to play this role so that it was the most similar to the reality, said Freeman.
Of course, the greatest challenge was talking to him.
The actor said that if he and the world politics were out of the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, to be between bastiers before his talk.
The most important was I wanted to throw his hand to Mandela.
I discovered that, when you take your hand, I received your energy, she transmitted and had the feelings of knowing how you feel, said.
For me, it is important to try to become me in a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pieiner, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to be prepared for a role in the hard rugby world.
A great surprise for him was when he finally met with Piener in his house.
I remember I called to the door, he opened and the first thing I told François Pieiner in my life was: "In the film I look much higher."
Despite the obvious differences between the persons of the actors and its real models, and under the manager of the Eastwood Director, Invictus: Inventable received positive reservations and also speaks of ambitions for Oscar.
The film criteria of the Daily Variety Tod McCarthy reported its evaluation with these words: "First a very good story, a very good film."
In the film reviews on the rotentomatotoes.com website, Invictus received a 76 percent of positive evaluations.
The secret of the splendler on Norway resumed: the Russians made tests of a misile
On the basis of Norwegian, a special light effect of unknown origin was observed.
The Ministry of Defence of Russia agreed to recognize that yesterday, close to the borders with Norway, he made evidence of a ballistic intercontinental millle.
The lancement broke again. The mixture, type "Blava", which was previously intended to be the fiery of the Russian Army, is becomes the peak of the Russian generals and the first Minister Vladimír Putin.
Not even her repeated presence in the tests of the missile has had the desired effect in the success of the test flights.
But, in most of the cases, there was no flight or a fall in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, "Bulava" writes as a "un miss that doesn't fly."
A miss that doesn't fly, but it lights.
During that, the 13th test, there was no problem at the beginning.
At the end of the airport there were new technical problems on the device.
The motor probably stormed in the third stage of the mile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submanager Dmitry Donskoy, who fled on the White Sea.
This type of mixture allows the launching from an embryo that is moved and is adjacent to the time.
That's why it's likely that the mystery light on Norway caused by an unidentified flying object, actually outside the "Bulava".
The Norways equal from the first time didn't vague that it was a Russian misil.
The generals this time are defended by claiming that it cannot only be spoken of a phrase.
The first two stages of the mixture were shot and it was produced in the third.
In previous cases, motors were immediately held in the first stage.
Although none of the lancements had been completely unrealised, under the management of the Ministry of Defence only six of the three were failed.
The success of almost a 50 percent full of optimism to generals and therefore still states that "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will even achieve 10 nuclear hypersensitive blocks, whose total weight is 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fésov signed a annual contract with CSKA from Moscow in 51 years.
Legendary Defensor Viacheslav Ftisov will return to a professional meeting of hockey for 51 years.
The former world campaign, olympic and winner of the Copa Stanley Cop will help your CSKA Moscú team and may play the Friday in the KHL dull against San Petersburg.
Fésov concluded its professional course to the age of 40 years in 1998 and currently presided the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was hurt, we need urgently another defender.
Fésov is constantly practical and has been engaged to help the team.
We only have to solve some formal matters, quoted the AP Agency to Sergei Nemchinov, the manager of Moscow club.
It is still not clear if the return of the famous player will be referring to a only game.
I think Ftisov is one of those who are able to raise the sense of the other players, mentioned Nemchinov.
According to AP if Fitisov returns to the ice pists, it will be become the longest Russian hockey professional player.
The Legendary Gordie Howe played in the NHL by Hartford to the age of fifty and a year, during the whole time, and achieved 15 goals and 26 helps.
The largest of the group of the five famous Fuitov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and outcomes of hockey players in the history.

In the second part of his way he also succeeded in the NHL: playing with Detroit gained the Copa Stanley two times.
Since 2001 he is a member of the Hockey Gloria Room.
Hyundai complyed the requirements of incidents. All additional work will be canceled
The direction of the car manufacturer in Nošovice agreed with the indicators to cancel all the additional work.
Precisely by the frequency additional work, the incidents declared the moon emergency to smoke.
The information was confirmed by Petr Van月k, the portrait of the Hyundai car manufacturer.
The address, however, wants to remember more sabbath turn for this year with the incidents.
We can't resign our manufacturing plan since it is essential. Therefore we propose voluntary work for Saturday 19 December, that is, two turns will be worked, said Vanak.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees working on the sabbath turn.
The bonus will also be paid on the last sabbath, 28 November.
The company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employers can cover extra hours or may take a free day on 28 December, i.e., extend on one day the boat feasts, mentioned Vanak.
Furthermore, all employees from the sabbath tours will receive money for the journey and food.
Since the supplementary work was the most urgent and problemtic point of comments and requests of the synthetics and helguists, which stopped the manufacture last week, the address at the afternoon decided immediately to cancel all the additional work for December, he mentioned VanWiek.
The employees of the car manufacturing were obligation to work two hours more than eight hours, and this situation has been practically held every day until the past week.
After the signing of the agreement, incidents will cancel the emergency of warming.
Another negotiation between the direction of the manufacture and the synthesis must be held on the morning.
The Chief of the Independents Peter Kucha had said the Middle Age, that if they are committed to comply with the requirements and the document will be signed, they are intended to cancel the emergency by heat.
The situation in the automobile manufacturing has increased the middle week, when approximately 400 employees had been exposed by additional work.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and the abuse.
The direction believed that employees had to work for extra hours to meet the requirements and to provide cars.
The synthetics in his statement of the emergency of the moon, also requested that none of the employees, which the past middle of the manufacture, were punished by any form.
With regard to the additional work, incidents require the company to reduce it at least.
Furthermore, this year, it requires a remuneration of 5.000 crowns for this work.
The car manufacture in Nošovice Hyundai is currently 2 000 employees.
The production in series was initiated last November.
To September last, he produced approximately 800,000 cars; its current productive potential is about 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: an effective substance to the 'intellected' virus of HIV'
Chess and German scientist team makes evidence of new components that can moderate HIV propagation in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against medicine viruss.
In some cases, this is more important than the fact that the combine is not so effective in a common virus variant, such as some accessible medicines already.
SIDA disease can't be healed until now.
However, the lives of patients may be significantly extended through a mixture of medicinal products that prevent the replication of HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many secondary effects.
If the virus replication is not completely pressed, the resistant viruss will be created; the medicines are no longer operated.
The work of experts of three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, of VãCHT Praga and the University of Heidelberg shows the possibility of domination of virus resistence.
They showed that metalcarburian substances have effect in albumin, responsible for the proliferation of HIV virus.
Metalcarbons are wooden, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt components.
These components block the propagation of virus in a different way to all medicines used today, and therefore can solve the problem of resistence.
In their work, scientists find new, “majored” compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular link to virus albumine.
Metalcarburians have a only threedimensional structure: two polyedre jalaes combined by bow, hydrogen and carbon are associated with metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
Traditional and resistent virus
The proteasis VIH is an albumine of HIV virus, and is impressive for virus vital cycle.
Without HIV protection, the HIV virus fragmentation is not produced and would not be created madural and corpsulas of virus.
If we take the VIH protease, we also prepare virus propagation in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press newspaper published by the Institute of Organic Chemical and Biochemics in the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a article published in the scientific magazine Journal of Medicinal Chemitry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two couples of jaulas (see table) are unified by a short organic series, which remains systematicly amended.
A little more weak but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was made in proof, and also against its resistent variations, obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of metalcarbons in the common variant of enzima is not so strong as in clinically used medicinal products, however, they do not have their effect on resistent variations, in which medicines often do not work.
The unique effect mechanism, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, that metallocarbourans are interesting for research with the aim of proposing effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlína ◆ezávevá, the head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic and Biological Chemical Chemical and the Institute of Molcular Genetics in the Academics.
ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself.
ODS Merek Topolanek said that the budget adopted for the year that it is "spantous" and the Government of the Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, thinking of his future existence.
ODS statements were mentioned by the First Minister as strong sentences.
They say that time is left for the analysis.
The Vice-President of ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the burocratic gift with the support of μSSD, ODS and the Green Party is evidently not working.
According to Neča, the First Minister must decide whether in the Deputy Chamber wants to be supported in minority, which is trying to fight the growing deficit, or if he wants to stay in his position with the assistance of the parliamentary left.
The ODS' attitude and social democracy towards the problem of public deficit is completely different, and Neč has warned.
The Chamber of Members yesterday adopted the 2010 budget, however, with the amendments to the left, over 12 million coronas.
The Deputy Chamber increased the money for the payment of State officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government rejected the ODS proposals, since they are closely enhanced the budgetary deficit.
The Czech Republic should rule with the deficit of 163 million coronas.
ODS before the vote went out of the room and thus fulfilled the Government's wish, that the amended budget is better than an provisional budget.
Delimitation and non-utility
The Minister of Hacienda, Eduard Janota, spoke of the disappearance and feelings of inutility; the first minister Jan Fischer said that the government would return to the current situation.
Neč is convinced that if Janota seriously threatens the dismission in the case of approval of the amendment proposals, the situation could be different.
According to Janota television, he asked a meeting with the first minister.
He learned, that you're thinking about staying on the role.
The reason is its disappearance for budget negotiations.
If fisher is agreed with another fight against the budgetary deficit, Nečas in the Government have nothing to do to the nominated by the SSD, which implies the changes in the budget.
The first minister should also clearly say, if the camera would dismiss other laws that increase the deficit, for example, subventions in diseases, revenues, or the amendment of the Service Law.
Topolanek: ODS Ministers have no fault
This is the case of the first Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ODS Ministers did nothing bad, subrayed Topolanek in the U.S. text news.
He recalled that in several departments, there are people who belong to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Neč emphasized that, if fisher decided to resign the principle of the fight with the height of the deficit of public hazard, "there is absolutely logical and correct, which is supported on the left-owner majority, which is currently present in the Chamber of Members".
However, it cannot be given to support and tolerance of ODS members.
I was not thinking about this, when it is the moment, I will take care of that, said the journalists in the Chamber of Defence Minister Martin Barták, which was appointed for the government precisely by ODS members.
The first Minister Fischer went out to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS requested the Prime Minister
Necks emphasized that the ODS’s mirror in the Chamber of Members probably would vote against the amended budget, if the first minister would not expressly request the ODS Members to allow the acceptation of the budget.
We don't feel orphans, we are not little children, responded to the question, if ODS is not concerned about the absence of the head of the party in the parliament and the Republic of Tschech, during the budget negotiations.
I didn't understand that my vow was missing.
In determining the mandate, Topolanek reacted himself in the next months to be tastefully on the chamber of Deputy Chamber and the destruction of all that positively.

RSA story concerns the world, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next days, a new film of Hollywood, from Clint Eastwood Invictus (Official title in Checo isInvictus: Nepora Ený), who takes part of the former president of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela.
The role of the worldly known fighter against the apartheid plays Morgan Freeman, who chose for years for the protagonist role the Mandela own.
The second paper, the legendary campaign in rugby Francoise Pieiner, interpreted it Matt Damon.
The reactions of the critical and public are born in the street.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on 18 July 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988, the Sacharov Prime received for the freedom of thought, in 1993, with the Klerk, the Nobel Prime of the Peace.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great hopes, since it comes to the public at the time, when the South African Republic collapses prepared for the global campeonate in Futbol. At the same time the means are stretched by alarming news on the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black majority.
According to the AP News Agency, reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite many reservations against the distribution of the protagonist roles by the "Pour interesting" stars in Hollywood.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he's fiery of the new film.
For many years I dreamed with the paper and was well prepared to play it.
A lot of times I found myself in person with Nelson Mandela, for - as it said - to catch his energy, mentioned in an interview after the festival in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if we can remember the person and Mandela's message.
It is a story of the Republic of South Africa, but in terms of all, he added.
At the tray of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book of the British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game was born the nation. Back to South African lawyer of human rights during its first period of electoral presidency.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to join two groups of residents, racially and for years separate. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he was also a protagonist of the South African National rugby team and entered into the game field. RSA gained the world's cup at that time.
By entering into the graph, that in RSA is considered as an almost holy thing, Mandela had great ovtions, especially the white public and the recognition of white people.
The Futbol campaign may be able to help people joining and forming a nation, mentioned the rugby Chester Williams player, the only "never" in the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen if the situation is better than the RSA.
Yet, the South African white are exposed, for example, in a receiving interview for LN a rugby rugby Christopher Dawson, who fled from your country to Britain.
The campaign started on 11 June 2010.

The fire has seen a transformer of the company ≥eps in a box of interruptor near the Výškov village in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the portrait of the U.S. bombers is extended by six groups.
Previously, the bombers wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, but later they changed the opinion and the fire are extracting it with a mixture of water, smoke and a special extinctor material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the cortocycle of the transformer.
There were no wounds, according to Pavla Mandatová, the company's voter, the warrant would not risk the insurance operation of the distribution system.

Jančura will submit a complaint by attack to three Germans of 周SSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Jančura will today present a complaint on the objection to three socialist Germans.
It is Michal Hašek of the Jihomoravsk kraj, Radko Martínek de Pardubický, and the island of Olomokuý short Martin Tesaík.
Jančura mentioned it in 25 minutes in Radioãurnali.
The demand needs to see with the efforts of the company, maintain regional railway transport in certain regions.
However, all the regions have completed signing contracts in long term with dragy.
All the three Italians are attacking us and talking about the fact that we're "tooking the past steps of the past", however we've brought only the offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we're more sweet than the drama, what is not true. We know the prices of ≥eské dráhy, which have been set in last week.
So we have no other thing to defend.
It's for the attack to the Student Agency, he said to Radioãurnál Jančura.
He said to have the tests of all the regions, as it did not take necessary measures in harmonization with the European law.
This is why it is preparing an approach to the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint by the continuation of the media show of Mr Jančura, which serves as a free publicity for its company and for himself.
Naturally I am prepared to protect my good reputation and my region and appeal to other Germans that are also doing it.
I guess that it will also be clearly demonstrated that Mr Jančura is managed to the public in the area of regional rail transport, and uses false and false arguments, mentioned Hašek.
Jančura announced the past week, which would invest several million crowns in the publicity, whose goal would be warning of these regions.
A radio-urnali said that it would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the new Year.
He said that the campaign will be carried out against corporation as such.
Jančura started the campaign after agreed with the regions in maintaining regional railway links and for approximately 150 million crowns did not summit.
According to Jančura, similar steps are indirect with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims that it was threatened by a Member of 周SSD, because of its criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that, if we don't let it, we can lose autobus licenses.
It was presented as Deputy of 周SSD, I know, what Mr, I'm not going to say his name, said Jančura today for Radio's radio.
Newmococal vacuum will be free and voluntary
The neumococal vaccine from January will end the usual costs.
As the first vaccine must be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, views are already appeared, that the obligatory vaccine would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vacuum against neurmococos collain.
The Institute of Medicinals is already fixing the maximum prices of vacuums, which will be covered by insurance companies.
The experts also have it clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vacuum
Free Paquets for children born in August
From January, children born since 2 August of the past year may receive the neumococal vacuum freely.
The condition is not received or dose of the vaccin before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or before have to cover other doses of the vaccine.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and the fifth age month.
Last year, the fourth part of the families had voluntaryly left to his children against neomocops.
Nevertheless, the parents payed for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
In order to vaccine children, four doses are needed.
In general, experts consider that insurance companies will be paid in vaccines from 300 to 450 thousand crowns annually.
Without embrace, they will have the treatment, which is needed for non-vacuated children.
Until now, the state was expensed for all the vaccination of children approximately 500 thousand every year.
The covered vaccination was started by the Janota's calling package.
Nemococo is the cause of media otitis, but also of serious infections include meningitis and septicemia.
Of the neumoccular infections in our country each year die according to investigations in 28 children not exceeding 10 years of age.
Besides the Chequia, the neumococal vacuum was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be bound?
However, views appear that this vacuum could be binding in future.
From January the insurance and voluntary companies must be covered.
The obligation vacuum would be better, for example, Rudolf Kalovský, chief of civil association Nalas.
Its association spreads the neumoccular vacuums since a long time.
Experts at a international conference, in which our partnership participated, were not fully satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other side, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the way we have to catch up, said Calovský.
However, the Ministry of Health does not wish to change the vaccination procedure against neurocoa.
At this time we don't think it absolutely, said his Vlastimil's portfolio.
Voluntary vacuum has their disappearances, claim doctors
The Chairman of the Peather Society Odborná společnost Praktických dítský léka ≤ Hana Cabrnochová recognizes that the voluntary vacuum has its disadvantages.
If all children receive the vaccine, it can be seen about the reduction of the number of doses. " In the situation, when the vaccine is due to such a high amount, we regardly understand the political decision that the vaccination has been initiated as voluntary," said Cabrnochova.
Experts hope that from the year that more than 80 percent of the young parents leaves to dogs against their children.
Nemomococal vaccine is also a great change because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Safety companys should pay more money in the profilexis, to ensure then the treatment, Cabrnochová explains.
The doctors will have to buy the vaccines for themselves.
However, the demandors are concerned about the purchase of vacuums.
Previously, the vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, as well as when the state gives other vaccines.
However, some deputates feared that insurance companies could "counter the money of health insurance".
The doctors will therefore have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that the petitors will invest in the vaccines of 40 thousand per month, which is a notable sum.
Nothing will be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist "in the royal of a museum"
The son of the renaissance artist of North American fantasy, Frank Fraretta, has been accused of trying to steal a valued painting in $20 million (12 million libraries) from his father's museo.
Pensilvania's police claims that Alfonso Frank Fraretta was attacked while he loaded 90 tables in his vehicle and rebound.
They say that Fractta and another man used a excavator to go in the museum, in the Pocon region.
Her father, 81 years old, is known by his representation of persons such as Conan the Barbaro and Tarzán.
The Association Press News Agency informed that the artist was in Florida at the time of accident.
AP reported that a non-identified police officer confirmed that a family dispute could have been motivated to young Fractta.
The agency informed that Frazatta, a son of 52 years, declared to the police that his father had ordered him to "in the museum through any means to transfer all the tables to a depository."
The agency said that Fractta's father refused to grant such permission.
The Labour Party depends on the increase in taxes in the budget
Ministers have defended the increase in tax and the expenditure of expenditure in the pre- budget report, against the critical of opposition, enterprises and incidents.
The Conservants said that Alistair Darling "released" a chance to show their series on the recovery of the deficit, delaying decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Hacienda also received critical criticisms to harm workers from lower and medium-sized income.
In its main proposals, 0.5 per cent of the social security expenditure and 1 per cent in the public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Correction for Social Security
Indeeds have regretted that workers with lower wages are punished with a recession generated by others and have warned on future "problems".
The increase in social security expenditure, which will grow about three million libraries a year, has escaped the business community, which states that this is a tax for jobs when the focus should be in the economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those gaining more than $20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
CLAVES OF THE INFORM INTERIOR AND PRÉSUPUES
Social security with an additional amount of 0.5% from April 2011
Economy will be contrary to more than expected 4,75 % this year
New tax of 50 % on banking goods
The submission of 1 point of the tax for small undertakings was discharged
Business Decree for electric motors and wind turbines
State pension would increase 2.5%
According to the estimates of the Ministry of Hacenda, a person who wins $30,000 will lose $90 per year and who wins $40,000 will lose $40,000, while a person who wins $10,000 per year will gain $110.10.
The ministers said that its goal to reduce half the deficit for 2013 involved "related decisions", but 60 per cent of the wage of additional tax taxes would be of 5 per cent of the highest wages.
The Minister of Hacienda, Stephen Timms, refused that tax subsidies and delined expenditures were a "grown swimming in the wilderness" in comparison with the need.
"There are large numbers. We will allow us to reduce the deficit to half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," said the BBC.
Mr. Timms said that the economy would grow up to the end of the year.
However, the progress of the laboratory party concerning the future economic growth, which will affect the quantity to request and rapidly reducing the deficit, has been deemed to be sure since the Minister of Hacenda had been obligation to change the first figures.
In its statement, it stated that the economy probably would be contrary to a 4,75% this year, much worse than the decrease of 3,5% pronounced in April, while the demand for the cost would be $3 million over the previously estimated.
"perfective opportunity"
The Conservators, which will launch a new public campaign on Thursday, advertising the "the debt crisis" of the laborist party, said that the request for £ 789 million for the next six years was resolved.
The Ministers had failed to submit a credible plan on the way they would restart the money, added, removed the difficult options until the elections should be carried out in June 2010.
"The Minister has not included anything significant on what they will do," said in the shadow of the Ministry of Hacenda, Philip Hammond. "There have been the opportunity to do and have disappeared it."
"All important advertisements will be done after the elections, gain who wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Working Party stressed that schools, hospitals and the police of future relaxed futures will be protected, notwithstanding the conservatory proposals, which would seek a further reduction of deficit to shorter terms.
But the free democrats stated that the money paid by tax increase and expenditures would be used to support the costs of the next year, not to reduce the deficit, argued that the projects were "saisoncasts".
The political editor of the BBC, Nick Robinson, said that the time chosen for the advertisements, such as the increase in inflation of some subsidies by unability of the next month of April, mentioned previously, would leave the Minister of Hacenda expressed to the accuses of electoral managers, as the money could simply recover the next year.
However, the laborist party stressed the need for people as well as the situation in September 2010 will be revised.
"The false prophecy"
While ministers did not publish the expenditure data after 2011, the economics said that public expenditure adjustment would only be felt in average.
The respected Institute of Fiscale Studies said that the numbers of the Minister of Hacienda involved substantial records in many areas, which could be included in future transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It's really laying the pain for further," said his director, Robert Chote.
"All important advertisements will come after the election, gain who win," added Roger Bootle, economic adviser of Deloitte accounters.
"This was the false previous report to the budget.
The FBI is on the United States detentions in Pakistan.
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five United States suspecting extremist connections.
The United States embler of Pakistan said to the BBC that men were arrested in a redacted house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI said he's going to investigate whether they're the same men who disappeared their households in the state of Virginia, the United States, the past month.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States said that he was also looking for information on men.
Three of them are paquistani descendance, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of yemenite origin.
"If they are North American citizens, of course, we will be very interested in the charges by which they have been detained and what kind of circumstances they are holding," said the portfolio Ian Kelly.
The FBI portrait, Katherine Schalla, said that the office was in aware of the detentions and was in contact with the families of disappeared students.
"We are working with the Palestinian authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if they are the students who were disappeared," said the portfolio.
The Paquistani Ambassador in Washington said that men were detained in a house that belongs to the boy of one of them.
He said that the house was already on the place of the police and that they have not yet been charged against detainees.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hillary Clinton, refused to comment on the detentions, informed the Reuters' News Office; but he said that the United States had "employed more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate terrorism infrastructure that continues to reclut and carry people."
Family of the five students declared their disappearance in North Virginia at the end of November.
International Amnesty condemns Iranian "abus"
Human rights in Iran for the past 20 years have always been equal to deficiencies, according to a report of the International campaign Group.
The report details the "the abuse models" of the regime, before and after the presidency elections held in June.
A man mentioned in the report said they had shot him and burned him with cigarettes.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of his history of human rights.
The officials said that such criticals have a political foundation.
The thousands of arrested persons and the ten murdered in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad caused the largest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Two persons have been condemned, and taxes claim that at least five persons have been sentenced to death.
The BBC's response in Teheran, Jon Leyne, who now is in London, says that during the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Jamenei, recognized some accuses of abuse, ordering the closure of the Khrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance to the criticals, according to our responsibilities.
"Falsa confidence"
International Amnistship cited the report of Ebrahim Mehtari, a team student of 26 years, who confirmed that he was accused of "laborating with Facebook networks" and protest against the result of the elections.
"On often they hit me in the face" according to their words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under the eyes, in the kitchen, the head, and they made me humble."
Amnistius said that after five days he signed a false confidence and left it and left it on the street, still blooding and semiconduced.
In August, the presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that some demonstrators arrested after the election had been tortured until death in prison, and others had been violated.
Iranian officials refused the accused of violation, but they admitted that there were abuses.
Amnist also cited the case of a former detention, who confirmed that he was retained in a container together with more than eight weeks, in a center of detention in Kahrizak.
Amnist recognized that the Iranian and the judicial parliament had established committees to investigate the malicious position and response of the Government, but said that the mandate and powers of the agencies were confused and the revisions of the parliamentary Committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been detained in the last three weeks to prevent more manifestations.
There was a piece of ski in the park of the city.
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to transform a Bristol interest site in a competitive track.
The Pista at the park event was 16 semiprofesional shots and snowboarders who made for premies in effect.
On the top of the end in Brandon Hill park, there was a short race of salt, in front of a 100 meters length.

Here are some of the best snowboarders and snowboarders of the road, true talent," added.
The premiums were delivered to the best trucks or managers carried out in the track.

Islam can be French?
Pluralism and pragmatics in a Latin State.
During a time when the Swedish voters requested that the construction of miners should be prohibited and that there is a generalized warning on the proposed islamization of Europe, John Bowen, a North American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of musulmans (the actually integrated) in one of the most openly Latin societys of the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as wonderers of the last work of the author 'Why the French Don't Like Headcarves' (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem he divided and carefully concerned the country for a decade and average, and the effects of which still exist today.
The last book of Mr Bowen has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologus, he wants to know not only what the politics and the means on the islam in France, but what really happens.
Last months in mixtures, schools and institutions that are now providing to the 5-6 million musulmans in France, what Mr Bowen is called "Islamic spaces".
He is a good hearing playing discussions between teachers and students on the more interesting questions.
Should a musulman be married in a mezquite or in a meeting (or both)?
Should you teach young musulmans about the evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a musulman marriage a non-muslim man?
Is it lawful that a musulman uses a banking system based on interests to get a hypotec?
These are apparently clean, sustaining, daily life things, which are worried about the most means than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of faiths, teachers and intelligents, no one of them of name, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramaldan, a academic and created musulman born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good muslim and a good citizen in modern Latin society.
This argument is not to be fully defined.
The conservators doubt only the idea of a French or European islam.
Mr Bowen interviewed thoughts and activists, who are currently having a small but influent presence between the musulmans of Europe, who are in the present part of the purist Sunni Islam's partnership with Saudi Arabia.
Bowen believes that musulman values and French lactim might be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual consequences.
Question to what point the French Political Strategys (and the intellectual election that is so courageously defended by the lactism) are really committed to the pluralism.
It suggests that musulmans probably have a more unjust treatment than the Catholics, protestants and Jews, who also have to do their historic commitments with the Latin Republic.
More than a growing pragmatism, it's "recording values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."

In his new book, "After the Ice" ("After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, an old designer of New Scientist, offers a clear and slowly relaxing about the Arctic science and a wonderful overcome of how the future of that place can be transformed.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
No atmospheric scientists or oceanographs can properly explain the speed of changes.
It's not lack of gun.
Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering trips at the end of the XIX century and the principles of the XX century were the first time on the movement of the ice mass.
Then the submergeds of the war were flowed by a map of the cords of ice movements that move under the glacies mass.
Satellite studies and extensive sound series on the icebergs are a nice addendum, but the resistent individuals in the fresh are still performing many tasks.

Marines between 6.000 that put crowns in the tombs of Arlington
Opc. De'Angello Robinson, of 19-year-old, traveled seven hours in the bus to put a only crown on the tomb of a soldier who never knew.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, N.C., to the National Cementary of Arlington to decorate the tombs, was a day to bring home to men and women who once standed in their boats.
In a few months, since we're busy, we could be us, said Robinson about the fellow soldiers.
If we are, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I just tried to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on the morning to colocate coronas in the tombs of the veteranes in several sections of the Arlington Cementary.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Coronas Worcester company in Harrington, Maine, started the event when he and other people decided to decorate several hundreds of tombs in the Arlington Cementorio.
In what is a 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year in various cities on the road, to offer events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also funded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other states.
This year, the volunteers took more than 16,000 crowds in the tombs of the Cementary of Arlington, the Pentágono, tombs in the National Cementary of Fayetteville in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York and the memory site by the United Airlines in Shanksville, Pensylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation gave more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old from Westminster, said the trip to Arlington in honor of his husband, a military carrier fault.
While her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way to give reward to those who sacrificed.
This is a modest way that civilians can support our troops, confirmed.
It's like to visit a family grave.
Available in caled clothed robe caps, voluntariors came through the widespread and collars of the cementary.
Volunteers moved to the oldest tombs of the World War, the Second World War, and the Vienna War, because they did not receive many visits such as the new tombs, said the organizations.
The atmosphere was glad while children played, and the couples were taken out of the hand, while they brought the fresh pione to the tombs.
Each circular crowd was of a green green, with a small red side at the top.
Search there, Section 60, where most of the veterians of Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, virtually still remained.
The United Nations Service (United Organizations Association) gave 1.000 crowns to decorate the section, but the sovereign atmosphere of the current wars invad the area.
People laughed openly, others relaxed, and the family and friends supported each other in the glacial air.
Some read high names on the stones, while others turned to see small white and black plates in the moving bar, for those whose stones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who played the laughings of his eyes before his son's tomb.
He kept eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Sgto marine artillery. David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
Nobody should never forget why we are free. My son paid for this, said.

Cuban officials arrested a United States government contractor
The Cuban Government has arrested a United States contractor who distributed mobiles and computers in the country, confirmed the Sabbath officers of the Department of State.
The contracteur, who has not yet been identified, is working for development Alternatives Inc, with seat in Bethesda.
The company works in projects for customers such as the United States Development Agency and the World Bank.
Advisory officers together with the United States Interests Section in Habana are seeking access to the detention who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although in accordance with the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be detained by almost any thing that is considered "de danger".
All against-revolutionary activities, including slow protests and critical writings, contain the risk of arrest.
Anti-governmental graphics and discourses are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an early blogger community, directed by the popular commentary Yoani Sánchez, which is often written on how she and her husband are followed and assembled by government agents.
Sánchez has requested several opportunities allowed to leave the country to accept premiums, but it has been rejected.
The detention of a United States contractor may likely cause tensions between the Communist Government of the Cathro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a "a slow ritmo" approach to improve the relationship with the island.
New York Times was the first to tell the arrest news on Friday night.
The new United States policy notes that if the Cuban Government take concrete measures, such as liberation of political prisons and the creation of more space for opposition, it will be recognized by the United States.
Mobiles and port computers are legal in Cuba, although new and codified products are in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban Government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobiles only this year; it is usually used for text messages, since a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily salary.
Internet use is extremely limited in the island.
It is available in cheap hotels and for foreign visitors from the hotel, and in some institution of the government, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is inusual.
Gloria Berbena, the press officer in the United States Interests Section in Habana, said that the majority of the US citizens in the prison in Cuba is among remissions for crimes such as drug traffic.
Berbena said I couldn't provide more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly disadvantaged.
A activity that in any other open society would be legal, as to repair free mobiles, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, the programme director of the Americans of the Human Rights Organization Watch, which recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, itself Cuba," a reference to Raúl Castro as a leader of the country, to replace his greater brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused are often arrested, processed and incarceled in one day.
He stated that any solution would probably be political, and the Cuban Government often causes negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries start to have more dialogue.
Paquistanian functions are designed to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Palestinian authorities neutralized the capture of a compulsory to send five men from North Virginia to the Afghanistan to kill US troops, expecting that the case could help the disposal of an extended network of terrorist recruitants, which reiterates the Internet in search for radio-radiated young people.
The investigators said they were following an insurgent image, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan then to find that one of them made comments by adopting terrorist attacks on the web website of YouTube.
Saifullah directed the men once they were in Pakistan, attempting to help them reach the remote area in the Pakistan tribal census, which is a family place for Qaeda and its terrorist trade fields.
But a paquistanic intelligence officer who had been informed on the case, showed the Sabbath that Saifullah could not convict the Commanders of the Qaeda that men were not part of a complement of the CIA to infiltre the terrorist network.
So, for several days, they were isolated in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the mountains of the north-west, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered as part of an covered operation.
For this reason, the officer confirmed that he spoke from the anonimate because of the delicacy of the case.
The officer said that men had not changed and even tried to obtain appropriate approval to access the Qaeda fields, when the Pacific police authorities arrested them.
The case of five men, who remain in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI, underlines the critical role of reclutors in the identification of potential terrorists and may certain those who are confident.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the American intelligence has been a major priority to infiltre people within the Qaeda.
The reclamers of the organization act as observers, not to leave those who have not shown a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who could be spices.
Analists said that the Qaeda was particularly analyzing attention to the aspiratory American records.
However, the organization represents a huge attractive, because of its potential to have access to the United States objectives and because of its distribution value.
But Evan Kohlmann, analist of senior for NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups also have become much more convenient in recent years with respect to those who admit, because the United States intelligence agencies have been experted in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltre someone in these groups, how better to follow the recruitment model How many have they already followed? did Kohlmann show.
It has been transformed in a much more based on the web.
Decades of thousands protesting in Copenhague, require climate action
On the Sabbath, thousands of demonstrators went out here through the streets requesting the negotiators working in the Bella Conventions Centre, the more climate actions.
The demonstrators said that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police felt that the amount was more than 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a bunch of inmascared activists collapsed small explosives close to a group of government buildings in the city centre.
In a day in which little happened in the United Nations climate discussions, thousands of activists caught through the city by supporting pantarifs in English that said "No planet B" and one in Spanish stated, "the Earth says "a suffice."
Many famous people joined the protest, including the Danish model and photography Helena Christianensen, who said that the Peru travels, the birth country of his mother, have made me aware of the enlarged matters that the country should lead from the impacts of climate changes that are already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I decided to join me to the great manifestation, to spread the word and to approve the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement.
This is not a easy task, but you have to do, there is no way to study it for more time.
The police forced the manifestators to reach too much to the Bella Center, and said they had been arrested to 19 people, mainly because of the use of mascars or of the lenses.
In accordance with the Danish law, these activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, he requested not to be identified for being involved in climate discussions, a number of actives with sports masks and all black attacks took a number of explosives near the main channel of Copenhague, which is close to several departments.
They were through the buildings, he said, adding that they were starting as calls, but they were followed by "one by large explosions."
In the center of conventions, people gathered around the TV screens to look for the walk during the late.
But the protest seemed not to fall into the consciousness of key officials like His Wei, Chief of China on the climate.
When it was asked whether he thought that the manifestation had a constructive impact in international discussions, he answered English, "Really it wasn't so much of the situation."
Then he continued to say in mandate, "How the meeting place is great, I can't hear what happens outside."
He noted that he was depending on the perspective of each one to define whether the journey was injury or benefit.
He said this shows the attention of the public in general and of different sectors to the issue of climate change.
Furthermore, "again, it can be said that negotiations affect, or freedom of other people.
A test data shows persistent racial differences
The Federal Headquarters Book on Mathematic performance, was a very good news for public schools of the Capital Distrit.
Although the Distrit is still far from the systems with better performance of the country, the qualification liberty showed that four and eight degrees had been swimed to a faster ritmo during the last two years, with regard to Atlanta, Chicago and New York cities.
But what remains recorded in the recent figures of the National Evaluation of the Educational Progress is the continuing difference of performance between African and white students at local and national level.
The average rates of four-level D.C. for the last two years increased from 262 to 270 (in a scale of 500), but their African couples only increased three points from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance difference increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the eight-line Africans remained essentially fixed, lowering an insignificant point from 245 to 244.
The average point of white points were not included in the test results, because the size of the sample was not pretty large.
During a six-year extension, the table is not more exciting.
The difference separated to white and four degrees in 2003, when the first ENPE was known in the District, was from 60 levels (262 to 202).
Although children in both groups have increased in this period, the difference has not been reduced to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern for the past week, since the advocates held by Dr. Michelle A. The Rhee and the Adrian M. Fenty (Democrata), were greatly inspired by white students, which are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have enhanced the joint to those in the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, has demonstrated Jeff Smith, executive Director of D.C. Voice, a non-professional organization that offers educational equity in the District.
I don't give pleasure for a difference of two or three points, the member of the Council of D.C., Kwame R. Brown (Dm.- Per acumulation), who has a daughter at the fourth level of the Eaton Elemental.
Brown, an assembled criticism of Rhee's administration style, said that the message of the evidence is that the secondary schools in the city have an unexpected need of attention.
Of course, they always want to see the positive characters, and I respect it.
But what is worried is that we don't dedicate the time nor energy required for our media schools.
Rhee said that the Distrit needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of under-related performance students.
This August, for example, is conducted to some teachers to use a new reading currency, the Lecture System of Wilson, directed to students of the upper levels of primary and medium school, which did not dominate the early reading foundations in their school courses and are significantly behind their parishes.
The mathematics of every day, a currency of mathematics from childgarten to sixth degree, which affects real life games and experiences, which was introduced in the Distrit under the former superintenden Clifford Janey, which has been admitted to him something of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I only think we need to continue to provide best interventions to students who are under the level of level, Rhee showed.
Others say that the ENPE’s results stress the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the system's general performance and even provide additional money and resources for low performance schools, which will be necessary to reduce the difference.
There is a kind of escape dilema for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studyed urban tests.
The solution of conventional policy is to provide its resources and reforms for localized schools in the poorest D.C.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions against that important chronograph.
But the problem, of course, is that, as other urban superintendents, it is trying to deceive the white and black class.
Our focus is to ensure that we built a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our barrial schools, so that all families, without taking into account where they live, have confidence in that their children can access an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of the schools of Newark, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end with performance difference is to expand the year of traditional public school, currently in the Distrit, in order to comply with autonomic schools.
It has been nearly 200 days to have the change force, said Janey, who has come to an agreement with his teachers' in the past year in 185 days, which is considered as a "indicator" to seek an increase in the next convention.
Face of upper education a part of more futures
The tourist bus came to the University of Gettysburg with a strong relief.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, went down and scattered for a moment before the white pillars, the ladderlo and the smerald breeds.
The parents of Graciela had been graduated in a secondary school of El Salvador.
Even a little time, Graciela itself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never had put a foot in a university camp.
However, when she and the other eight degrees of the group studied Gettysburg, where the matricule of $38,690 per year was less than the impresional invitations than potential student enthusiastes.
Yes! here I'm going to be! Greciela called who would like to study medical medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered in the science building.
Caray, is it serious? He thoughtfully said, when the Guide spoke of the lower currency teachers at school.
The University of Pensilvania was the seventh that children had visited in their trip for three days, and had been completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not if you go to university.
The question is what.
Although there is a growing concern for the large number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who have left secondary schools or are embarased in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands that are access to university education needed to access the media class.
In fact, one of the five of these Spanish "the second generation" is grateful to university, a notable achievement because many of its immigrant parents, especially the Mexico and Central Americans, entered into the United States without ending the secondary school.
His success storys are important, claim investigators, because they indicate the way to follow for a generation that will play a role of great importance in the work force of the country.
The ones who are analyzing the highest performance say that they often have a natural favour for school and an unborn trend to have success.
Many parents also have high objectives for their children and find ways to compensate their absence of family with the United States schools.
However, tutoral programmes can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children as to reach university, particularly if efforts are undertaken in time.
Noting children of lower income, whose parents do not have experience and ability to help them to navigate through the system, it is concluded that any intervention at any time will not be solved, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher of California University, Davis, who has studied Latin students.
We have to think about providing a support network for these children, from the child garden to the secondary school.
The Federal Programme financed the round of the University of Graciela is an useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems, to implement university preparation programmes that begin when lower income students are in the middle school and continue to end secondary school.
Since 1999, the programme has assisted more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent often by the University, according to the United States Education Department.
The Ministry of the Irish Petroleo has reached agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns of violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has reached important petrol firms to rebuilding its infrastructure during two substakes concluded on the Sabbath.
The 10 agreements that the Ministry of Petroleo has reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and the European oil companies are ready to play a main role in the restoration of the oil industry in Iraq, mixed by ten wars and sanctions.
American companies were alienated by put in only two of the 10 substantive ages.
Seven American companys had paid to participate in the second subast which started the Friday.
The only offer that offered was lost.
Two American companies reached agreements for substantive homes in June.
The poor representation of the United States oil Greats in the opening of the oil industry in Iraq was surprised the analysis.
Irak finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asian and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, the Forum of Petroleo, a online news center.
It'll pass a long time before something else will be offered in Iraq.
The security concerns, focused on mass-coordined bombards, and the political instability of the United States, while military military, probably imposed the United States oil companies to arise more energeticly in Iraq, which has the third most important reservation of crude in the world, confirmed analists.
The United States enterprises were in some cases in disagreement, because rivals, in particular Chineses and other energy companies controlled by the Government, have significantly lower work costs and are more proud to take risk because they do not respond to accionists.
Exxon-Mobil and West Petroleum Inc were the only United States companies who reached agreements with the ministry.
The main signs of the United States, such as Chevron and ConcocoPhillips, who have stretched steps with the Ministry of Irish Petroleo and have provided technical advisers in recent years, were removed with empty hands.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts granted this week end.
The National Corporation of Petroleo, Chinese property, offered in more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two main ages.
We know that China is on the way to become a major economic and technological power, he showed the port of the Ministry of Peterleo Assam Jihad.
We have confidence in that the Chinese company will be part of its competitors and will fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
The companies elected to submit proposals made offers and then compared to baril subvention that the Ministry was ready to pay for the production above the current levels.
The Qaeda main planning planning was apparently killed in Pakistan
It is believed that an attack with the United States Military at the border of Pakistan with Afghanistan has killed a major operation planning planning for the Qaeda this week, who said that the United States terrorism officers said.
To be confirmed, this would be the second mortal attack against a high terrorist leader of this ocean.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men who think it was missed on march when a couple of misiles affected its car near the city of Miran Shah, in the north Waziristan province, according to the United States and Palestinian officials of the region.
The local authorities said that the missions were launched by an unidentified aircraft, the type operated by the CIA in the illegal tribal area of Pakistan.
They were conducting a white car, directed to the Afghan border, when the car had received the impact, said a official of the civil intelligence agency of Pakistan, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The officer said that the local suspected warriors were reflected in the place and quickly confided what was left of the "allly destroyed."
The local authorities were not able to verify the victims' identities, but two American counter-terrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was between the dead.
It was described to Somalia as a high-range military planning planning planning in the Qaeda, which directed the operations of the terrorist group outside the Afghan-Pakistan region.
It was encouraged to inspire around the world, said a high officer, who spoke from the anonymous, circled the delicate nature of the American air attacks within the paquistani territory.
In view of its central role, this has probably included conspiratory attacks against the United States and Europe.
I had a strategic lead of the above command of Qaeda and delivered it to operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second official of the United States said that Somali was rapidly reached into the boards of the Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some of the United States, but this does not diminish in any way the threat that we planned and our friends, confirmed the second official.
If your death is confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of the Qaeda or the leader Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack killed Naumuddin Jalov, the leader of a military faction in the tribal area, and other three high rango agents.
The ritmo of non- piloted aircraft attacks by CIA has reduced from summer, from a average of approximately six operations to two months, according to a receipt of The Long War Journal, a website directed by a non-profit organization.
The reduction may be improved by the terrorist groups, which have taken measures to limit their vulnerability while murdering suspicioned information, confirmed the site.
The maximum sent by the United Nations to Kabul at the point of rejection
The maximum sent by the United Nations to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said the Friday that would reiterate its post in March, ending with a huge mandate that was condemned by the complaints of corruption extended in the presidency of Afghanistan supported by the United Nations.
Eide outcome happens when Obama’s administration has decided to send more than 300,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
The sentence of the United Nations said that it supports the increase, but it was concerned that the United States chronogram for the starting military retirement in 18 months has emphasized other OTAN Governments to remove its forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the correct signal to the Afghan to trust in the international community, Eide noted a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
Norwegian diplomatics also expressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil officials working with the Afghan political transition.
The increase in military sector must be reflected in the civil sector, confirmed.
Eide said he was not allowing, but just fulfilling a promise he made her family in March 2008 to pass only two years in Kabul.
He said that I would like to notify the Secretary
General of the United Nations Ban Ki-monon, so it would have time to find a replacement.
What I said is better starting looking for a successor, she showed Eide.
When I came here, there was an empty two months between the exit of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has started seeking a replacement, according to the United Nations officials.
The officials say that they have been considered to Staffan of Mistura, a Swedish citizen who recently directed the United Nations mission to Bagdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who previously directed United Nations peace missions.
The position of Eide in Afghan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September to encourage President Hamid Karzai in the presidency of the country and to cover evidence of massive electoral fraude.
Eide refused the incrimination, but he said that the accuses of Galbraith, who had been released, "we surely perverted the mission, because he had already many sceptics in terms of international interference" in the election.
Eide said that I proposed the appointment of a high civil representative to coordinate the efforts of assistance by the United States in Afghanistan.
He also emphasized the leading of the United Nations to allow its successors to contract more personal than the United States and other Western countries, which are provided to the Afghan mission, claiming that this would increase their trust in that money is correctly used.
Eide expressed its frustration for the limitation to its powers in Afghanistan, stressing that the United Nations enlarged provisions have less than their capacity to capture talents.
That is so that the United Nations rules allowed me to refer to a person from May only shown.
This is catastrost and you can't continue.
Gates: Additional sanctions will go
The Secretary of Defence, Robert M. Gates, said that the world powers will soon impose "additional sanctions" against Iran, because of his fracase to discuss their nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 American soldiers in North Iraq, during a week trip in war areas in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained the importance of the perspective of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, in response to the question of a soldier on the probability of such a event.
One of the things I doubt is that, if we learned something from Iraq over the last six years, it is the inherent inconvenibility of the war.
Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at the Iranian military and political election, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect Iranian population in general.
It was said that it would be necessary "a packet of incentives and descensives", "to convince the Iranian government that they would be really less secured with nuclear weapons", because "they people will suffer greatly" sanctions.
On Friday, in a declaration of the Port of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration joined the European leaders to warn that Iran will confront “believable” consequences if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the indications of the United Nations Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
They will insist in developing nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In conversations in Geneva on 1 October, he pointed out that it would again be negotiated on the restriction of its nuclear programme and would accept a substantial part of its enriched uranium reserve, in change of the fuel that was needed for a medical reactor.
The administration has expressed for this agreement as a way to build confidence between both parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have disappeared the tentative agreements, partly, state the experts, because Iran’s order is divided in connection with the possibility of engaged with the United States.
I think that Iran’s ambition with the international community on some proposals that have actually accepted at the beginning of October, has joined the international community, including Russians and Chineses, in one way that it had not been in terms of significant sanctions against Iran.
The President Obama has made a limit on 31 December to respond to the proposals before replying other options, even to continue with what the Minister of External Affairs, Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called "external sanctions".
In a declaration made in New York, the Iranian mission announced what the Thursday called "infunded and basic appeal" by some members of the Security Council on nuclear activities of Iran, and said that he had the intention of continued discussions with the United States and other five global powers " to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who would return to Washington last Friday, was found tomorrow with the Irish Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki, before flighting to the current Iraq River Petroleum Region, to meet troops in Kirkuk and Kured officers in Irbil.
The tensions are still high between the courses and the Arab most of Iraq, particularly regarding borders, property rights and participation.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential for conflict to avoid any delay in the United States projects to reduce the number of United States troops from 115,000 to 50,000 before August.
Gates also tried to encourage the forced concern of the delaying reduction. The United States officials cited the words of Gates to Massoud Barzani, President of the Regional Government of Korea: "We will keep their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We won't leave them."
In a China who is old, a rumbo change
Wang Weijia and her husband grew roded by promoting cards that they talk about the fact that "The Mother Earth is too stopped to support more children" and "a baby but means more tomb."
They took the election as well as when the government’s officers were warned by the underlying birth index and the old population of his city, they suddenly changed the summer and began to inspire young couples to have more child, his reaction was immediate and firm: no way.
We've already given all our time and energy for a child.
We have nothing for a second, said Wang, of 31 years, a human resource manager with an eight months.
More than 30 years after a single son's policy is introduced in China, creating two generations of narrowly rechonded children, uncovered unfair children, who have “beings of undertakings” is surrounding a demographic crisis in the country.
The average birth index has falled at 1,8 children per couple, compared to six when the policy was done, according to the Division
United Nations Demographic, while presumed that the number of residents of 60 years and more expaned from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent to 2050. This is very higher than the global average of approximately 20 percent.
Unbalance is worse in the rich coast cities with very cultural populations, like Shangai.
Last year, the people of 60 years and more contained almost 22 percent of the residents registered in Shangai, while the birth index was less than a couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Family Planning Commission and Municipal Municipal of Shangai, has shown that the fair couples should have babys to "aid to reduce the proportion of the old population and to hold an future escape of work."
Shangai is about to be "the old (not so rich, however) as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," confirmed.
A gradual alivio
In 1978, a single son's policy is possible to the most popular mandate entered by the Communist Party until the date.
Countries who violate the political face largely, until three times their annual wage in certain areas, and working discrimination.
Chinese officials have appreciated the policy for their contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have declared abusive in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have bound women with a second child to submit abuse.
Furthermore, many couples have aborted according to the sex of the fetus, bringing a high innatural proportion of male-mojer.
In recent years, demographic officials gradually put their position on the single child policy.
In 2004, more exceptions were allowed to rule, including urban residents, ethnic minorities members and cases where both the husband and the woman were the only children, and in 2007 many of their hard line legs were attained.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor of the Demographic Research Institute of the University of Pikin, said that the officers of the Central Government have recently discussed more radical changes, as allowing couples to have two children if one of the neighbourhoods is the only son.
In July, Shangai became the first Chinese city in launching a aggressive campaign to incense more births.
Before the morning, the cards that ordered families to have a single son were replaced by regulations detailed who would be a second son and how to ask a permission.
The Government of the city sent to the family and voluntary planning officers to visit couples in his houses and to disappear flocked under the doors.
He also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than a child.
Family planning officers say that the response has been very small.
Deploying reply
Although a rural city officers in Shangai are understood that they have observed a moderate increase in the requests of couples wishing a second son after the launch of the campaign, the most urban districts have no change.
The Huinan municipality with a population of 115.000, for example, is still received from four to five requests per month.
Shangai officials said that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still prevailed in 2010 only reaching around 165.000, lower than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juging, Chief of the Family Planning Committee of the Caolu municipality in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want children more.
They want to give his first son better, he confirmed.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, of 26, said that they would like two sons and are legally enabled to do it.
But as many Chineses, they only have medical and insufficient life insurance that the government provides them.
Without a social protection network, it is sustainable, this option would be unreasonable.
People in the Western see wrongly the policy of the unique son as a question of rights, said Yang, an engineer of the construction whose wife is married from seven months of the first boy of the couple.
Yeah, you're running the possibility of having more than a son.
But the problem is not only a political question.
It's the money.
Other couples have psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, manager of human resources, said that he wants a single son because she was also: "We were the center of our families and we were assemblies to all care for us.
We are not driving to worry about others and we really don't want to worry about others."
Chen Zeian, 42 years old, owner of a Translation Agency, explained it in more comprehensive manner.
For parents with two roads, the average class, which reduce the birth index, he confirmed that it is being sufficiently successful for being egoists.
People from 20 to 30 years have grown by seeing the fight of their fathers during the first days of China’s  experiment with capitalism and do not want that kind of life for themselves, he manifested.
Even one kid needs a long time for parents.
A mother has to refuse at least two years of their social life.
Then there are space issues: "There are to remove their apartment," and the strategic "he must have a currency prepared for the best guards when the child has 9 months."
Most of his friends are ready to fight this once, said Chen, but not two.
Our is the first generation with the highest level of life, she demonstrated.
We don't want to do a lot of sacrifices.
A United Nations group requires a plan to reduce emissions
The United Nations climate conference, characterized until now by disappearing posts and mutual recruitments, took a renewed attention on the Friday with the dissemination of a document that provides ambitious reductions of the inner gas in the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations that lead the major part of the load in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement in order to regular winter gas effects, has resolved the remaining obstacles and delayed the way to follow.
But it was seen as an important progress in a negotiation that remains without time, with more than 100 global leaders that will come to Copenhague next week.
Working by an ad hoc working group of the United Nations, the text does not speak about how much money the poor countries would give it to the poor in order to face the global short and long-term warning.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how the developed economies and the main emergency economy would cover their carbon production, and what would be the limit of the global increase in the temperature that political strategys would be ready to be tolerated.
This gives you much flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, high representative in Washington for Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutiar, which formed the six page document, summarised a negotiation text of 180 pages to focus on the most climatic functional of the United Nations, Yvo de Bóer, described as "the great panorama".
Shows profiles for possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collect their emissions for 2020 between 25 and 45 per cent, compared with the 1990 levels, while the main developing countries would reduce their amounts for the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
The Councils would recover emissions between 50 and 95 percent to 2050.
The European Union also stimulated the meetings on Friday, promised to provide $3,600 million over the next three years, to assist poorest countries to adapt the impact of climate change, from inundations and seeds to deforestation.
On every way, the Friday has presented the same kind of verbal artificial fires that have dominated the conversations last week.
The Special Climate Shipping of the United States, Todd Stern, rejected the claims requesting binding gas emissions for industrialized countries, in comparison with the volunteers of the main economies, if they are not financed by the developed world.
The manager indicated that Obama’s administration is taking a harder line with China, as regards the Bush Administration Officers only two years ago.
The United States will not make an agreement without the main developing countries to advance and take measures, showed Stern, who also regretted that the text did not sufficiently to ensure that the recovery could be checked by external observers.
Stern made its comments a hour after the Vice-Premier for Foreign Affairs of China He Yafei, confirmed that the United States's highest climate negotiator was "common sense" or was "related" for having said before the week that the United States would not help China economicly face global resolve.
With the future economic trajector of the main world's world's world's powers in game, the fall lines have resulted so far in the world in development ways, as well as between the industrial world and the emergency economy.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States, focusing on their respective obligations, while the poorest nations stress that the fourteenth most influence countries in the world are ignored the scientific initiative to take the most stronger action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate of Costa Rica, said that it is not surprised that the main powers are discussing on whom the costs should cost to limit winter effect gases, even when vulnerable countries have become more aggressive by seeking to contain the great emissions responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developed, substantive Ulate, which is also working as a regional adviser on the climate change of Mexico and Central America, for international conservation.
Some of the most vulnerable countries in the impact of climate change indicated that they would follow pressure for a legally binding treaty in Kopenhagen, although most of the major participants said that the discussions would be made up a political agreement.
The Partnership of Small Insular States, contained with 43 members, has developed a preliminary treaty proposal on 24 pages at the morning of Friday.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, which undertake international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the emphasis of the small island nations has "political pressure on the whole political process," in part because they are now unified and require the action of emergency economy, such as China and India.
The discussion was a new urgence, while delegates focused on the fact that most of the exceptional issues should be solved before government heads have been able to close a treaty.
High-level officers, such as Jairam Ramesh Middle Ambition Minister and the Chinese Vice Minister, descended from the aircraft and traveled to the Bella Center's passengers, at closed gates and press conferences, in order to eliminate reclaims that will be arbitrated during the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (of the day 13,000 persons enter and get out of the convention centre, the activists touching the Guitar presenting night spectrums by flowing from countries that are sold, and pre-estained proposals in hand instead of e-mail way), plans a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here at this time, and the 60 government heads will be in Copenhague.
We're going to the older bonds, Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Vice-President for the international conservation policy.
Weight weights are reaching.
The first train at 225 km from Great Britain refines this feeling of the moon
On 5.13 of the morning, a silver will strengthen the darkness to indicate a train outcome that marks a revolution for travels in British Britain.
The first high speed train from the country will reach 225 km, when it passes as a rail from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretariat of Transport, will then be joined Ms. Kelly Holmes, on the boat of the first inter-agency service Javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service eventually connects to the Great Britain to a internationally reliable, reliable train network and connects the large Middle-Bases, Northern and Scozia in London.
The disagreements of apart areas would be converted in suburbly approaches, business travel times would be reduced and the change of railways and vehicles would reduce national carbon emissions, as well as the road management.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of thousands of millions of libraries needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable war of planning and environmental damage can still break the high speed lines in British.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to prove the Government a viability study, will deliver his report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times.
This will provide you a detailed stage of the next planned stage for the high speed network.
The new line that London to the Western Middlelands will be moved within a radio of five meters in urban areas and areas where environmental impact can be polematic.
In rural areas, the plan will be reached within a radio of 25 meters from a final road.
HS2 is also expected to set up three options for a broader higher speed network than the north.
Lord Adonis will answer early.
The favourite option that is proposed is a set of Y, in which one high speed line would reach the Middle East.
The line would be divided in or near Birmingham, with a gam that leads to the west from the Peninos to Manchester and Scozia, and another towards the northwest to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
One line would enter in Scozia.
"For this is the most profitable option," said a rail member.
Once it ended, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which would not be involved before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, in comparison with less than an current hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel to 402 km, turning into the British network into the fastest Europe.
The initial path is designed to support 400 meters of length, which are able to transport 1.100 people.
For at least 18 trains they could operate every hour in a line of London-Birmingham.
This means that a Londres terminal would be needed to receive 20,000 passengers per hour.
In view of the restrictions of the capital, a existing station is expected to reach the high speed network.
The experts of the rail industry say that only the St. Pancras International or Euston station offers that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce if it believes that the scene should be done, but a wide public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be taken until after a general election.
Even if the work is carried out, the network should be built in sections.
At the beginning the trains would be obliged to leave fast lines by the cars existing in the north of Birmingham, maintaining the travel time between London and Scozia over the three hours.
This is considered as the crucial point necessary to ensure a change of train aircraft, a reference point for rail revolution.
The contributions are concentrated with the hipoteca by a narrow of £75.000 of a Conservator
Alan Duncan, the voter of the Conservatory Party, contributed thousands of books to the year by the cost of a naranjaal he built in the house of his electoral district.
The voter of the party, who was degraded by David Cameron to want the deputys to live "de rations", increased its hipoteca in £75.000 to build an extension in his second house in Rutland.
It allowed you to load the added interest, summing hundreds of books per month.
The Common Chamber's authorities adopted the requests at its time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Bill, which brings a review of the expenses of the members. At night, Mr. Duncan said that the requests " could not be clear or simply."
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of the Parliament, has a house of two pools in a people in Rutland and Melton's electoral district.
The nearby houses were sold for almost a million of books.
The lower plant includes a kitchen, room of being and dinner, but the honorary office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a winter to the house, described on the plans as a "naranjal".
The neighbours described it as a "inverter for interview".
Mr. Duncan was not requested to make a reference on the increase of the loans, during a recent investigation of the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the Chamber of the Commons on its previous hypothetic agreements.
In the past month, the Committee denied him to violate the rules after an investigation of its expenditures.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a 271.406 books of its ownership in London to the home of its electoral district, which had been bought in 1991, the previous year to become a deputy.
The documents distributed this week showed that Mr. Duncan was requesting approximately 1.400 monthly libraries for hypotecical interests until March of the past year.
In April, its requests increased more than $1,800 per month.
The type of interest in the Real Bank of Scotia, Mr. Duncan, has not changed at that time, suggesting that an increase would be funded by 75,000 libraries.
The standard standard hypotecical type of BRE was 7,94% in December 2007, to 4% in March this year, which is now present.
The recent document issued by the Chamber's authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued requesting £2.50 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his work as President of the Opposition of the Chamber in September, after a covered reporter had filmed him, saying that the Members had to survive "de rations" after the expenditure of expenditures.
"This is mostly nationalized, you have to live rations and be treated as m**rda."
He said, "I have my money in my garden and wanted a small fraction on the basis of what is appropriate.
And I could ask much more, but I don't do it."
The Deputy, a thousand for his former professional as oil trader, was first questioned on its expenditures in May, when it was resulted that he asked thousands of libraries for his garden before agreeing with the salary office that this might " be considered excessive."
A activist caught an aggregate with the form of the sterlinic book symbol in Mr. Duncan as a protest, when he discovered that he requested 4.000 libraries for three years.
Mr. Duncan said: "It was for primary improvements, adopted both by the salary office and later by the law."
He added: "It's not about prosecuting and denial or infringing the rules or whatever it is.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and all.
I couldn't be in any more clear or simple way."

The allocation of history and geography is strengthened by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, declared in an interview that will be transmitted to the Sunday Information (JDD, according to its French silk) that history and geography would be "functive" of the reform of the secondary education, although they are removed from obligatory education in the second year of scientific bacterian.
From now on, all the schools of the first bacchillerate will have four weeks and the same program for a shared culture, stated by Chatel.
For the Minister, "based with hypocrisy" so, according to him, "the rama C is no longer a scientific dimension", but "in general, calls for the best students."
General Learning and Literary branches can't be submenus of the C, including subraying: "I have heard that stories or intelligents would have been unlawned because they had removed history and geography in second cupage in technological schools."
A IFOP sound published on Saturday in the Humanity revealed that approximately seven French (69%) disappeared the governmental project to remove the obligatory history-geographical teaching in second cupage of C. A number of intellectual and teachers, the left and some chosen representatives of the right were also critical.
Instead, the Minister added that "not speaking" to remove philosophy of the second Bachillerato C programme.

Return in payments: disgusting between prison garders, actions are intended to be taken
Independents of prison officers were convened on Friday to a "all mobilization" to require payment before the end of the year's feasts, of the princes and of the extra hours, which was set up to January for budgetary reasons.
The Employment Force had requested the staff out of service to be joined on the morning's Monday in front of prisons and "locking them" to state the role of their own.
The CGT penitentiary (3 or notice of the profession) calls for them to "come together in general meetings in the various prisons to achieve massive mobilization", as it was "because and unacceptable" the incompliance of payment in December of the "external hours, night premiums, Sundays and festivals" working in October.
And the first set of observers, the Federal Union Autonomim Penitenciaria (Ufap/Unsa), "requests to general mobilization (...) to increase the decontinent and furiousness."
The Directorate of the Pensionary Administration and the Ministry of Justice explains that extra hours were increased in 2009 and not all were accounted, but ensure that the sal will be subscribed in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Cancillery reported that Michele Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the observers while guaranteeing them that the payment would be performed next month.
Unfortunately of the efforts made by the staff for the operation and modernization of our pending system, the Minister of Justice is written in this letter.
Delivery to the Office of Pensionary Administration to immediately implement a set of measures aimed at that situation generated by a bad assessment of the number of extra hours should not be produced in the future.
The payment of December will then be mixed, except for the manager of the direction which enjoys the benefit of the famous princes by functions and objectives, and that "the budgetary requirement has always been faulted," said Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scanning, said the FO Interregional Union of Marsella, announced its decision to boicote up to the new order "All meetings and convocations."
The staff will not work on Sundays and festival days for the month of October to be paid in December, the same will happen with extra hours, FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also.
At the time that we increase the tasks and missions without taking more effective, it is more than unfortunately attractive to aggregate staff wages, estimates the Burdeos CGT penitentiary.
According to incidents, not in all regions it happens the same as some have more luck than others.
But anyway, the result is not the expected, confirmed the Secretary-General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.

Euro-2009/Piness short: first title of Bousquet in its favorite distance
François Frédéric Bousquet, a three-time medialist in the wide pool worlds-2009, received a international title in a distance from which it feels specially off, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in short pool in Estambul.
At the first day of this competition in which polyuretan bathers were recently allowed, only three records of the world were overcome when they actually waited for many more.
One was improved by the Hungary Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian leaving 4 x 50 m 4 styles (masculin).
A pena for Bousquet, which encountered the record of the world in 50 m free mark, containing a long pool (20.94).
In one of the two Queen distances of the Nation, in 50 m free, the French of 28 years was imposed with 20'53 during an end where ten nouries were composed of eight as usual, a primacy at international level.
Busquet added the Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but did not achieve the global brand (20.30), as it was planned.
We can always trick something better and, in that case, I already said that if the memory of the world was at my distance, I was trying to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all poliuretain bathrooms were put on 1 January are prohibited.
These bathrooms, originating 238 global records since February 2008, end their epope in Estambul, where they first performed in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of bathers did not help German Paul Biedermann, two world campaigns in the pool long this summer in Rome, consecutive global records.
The young donor hasn't reached its mark in 400 m free (3:32.77), but it was imposed with the first time of his car (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't get back into this cart.
I knew that this time I wouldn't be able to fight a global record, but I would protect my title and fulfil my mission.
Lobintsev will be a hard rival in the future, explained Biedermann.

Honduras rejected Zelaya's exit to Mexico
Mexico said that the conditions were not given to move to his territory to the desolated President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whose government had refused the delivery.

The Middle Aviation of the Mexican Government which came to El Salvador to bring him to Zelaah, returned to its place of origin, according to a source of the General Directorate of Migration.
In order to grant a free conduct, the Golpist Government wishes to oblige Zelaya to "reclare" and to ask political asylum in the foreigner.
But the deployed President was denied because he wanted to come to Mexico as a head of State in invited year.
The Golfist Government "did a new delay in asking me to reply to my charge (...), they wanted to submit my complaint," said Zelaya the Thursday to Radio Globo, in which it would make statements from the beginning of the political crisis that takes five months in the Central America.
I can stay here ten years, I have my guitar, added a couple of agreements to the defended President, refugee in the Brazilian embarrassement of Tegucigalpa for two months ago.

Since his exil to Costa Rica, he was surprisedly returned on 21 September and fled to Brazil’s embarrassement.

Three days later, the Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to the power until he ended its mandate on 27 January.

U.S.: The Polianski lawyer again requests that the cause is deprived
The Franco-Polanski cinema lawyer, Roman Polanski, relocated this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western of the United States), who dismissed the cause against his client, which is under home arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse arising over 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer of the "El Pianist", announced before three judges of the Appeal Chamber of the Second District of California serious proceeding errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
Hummel declared: I call that at the same time the charges are dismissed, since the conduct of the judge on the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "resultated slowly."
According to him, the judge Rittenband (falled since then) would have discussed with a tax that would have noted him that Roman Polanski would want to go to prison before the sentence, which is a serious lack of proceedings.
This conversation was made public in the document "Roman Polanski: desired and desired" (Roman Polanski, searched and desired) of the own mouth of the fiscal concerned, David Wells.
But eventually Wells declared at the end of September "mended mankind" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel recalled the celebration of a sentence that would allow him to submit the evidence of his argument in the case that the court rejected the disappearance of the case.
The accusation, on its part, reiterated the statement expressed in the first instance, is that there could not be seriously evaluation of the taxes in both Roman Polanski will not be presented before the court.
The cinasta, 76 years old, fled from the United States in 1978 before his sentence was sentenced by "unlawful sexual relations" with a less than 13 years old.
Since then, never returned back to the United States.
The district viceficial of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, declared that Roman Polanski " had to be here to present in the audience."
In this case, we want to transmit the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accusers, that there is an opportunity to escape?, Asayama asked.
For her, the cinema "paid a favor to the court, although it disappoints his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to proclaim their sentence, also raised "for other alternatives to the decision to escape."
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the cause against Roman Polanski.
Abogada of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also recalled, once again, close the case.
It supports that your customer is no longer supporting her when he rises the Polanski case, and adds: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was right.
Thirty and two years, it's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland by North American arrest order.
After more than two months later, they condemned him to home prison at their Gstaad chain, at the expectation of an eventual extradition.

The news about Johnny Hallyday "She's very positive", according to your son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "She's very positive," ensured her son David's saturday when he came to the Los Angeles airport to join his hospitalized father from a few days.
The news are very positive.
Dad is strong, and it's very good, and he declared David Hallyday's pressure when he was down from the airport that he brought him from Paris a little after 13:00 (21 h. GMT).
The son of the defended son assured that it would be transferred to the cedars-Sinai hospital of Los Ángeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered the moon by an infection resulting from the discovery heritage operation last 26 November in Paris.
The music is "in coma induced from that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to avoid that the use and power so manages its treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday has already been subject to a coma undertaken by Cedars-Siniai's hospital doctors from Los Angeles, where the moon entered by an infection, followed by a discreet hero operation on 26 November last in Paris.
The song was once again operated in the Thursday night because of serious lessons produced by the previous intervention.
His Laeticia wife was Friday at the French liceon of Los Ángeles, who attended her daughter Jade, to present a school act, confirmed a photograph of the AFP.
The Chief of Ortoped Crimecy and Traumatology of the hospital of the Pitié-Salphalter, Yves Catoné, announced that moon would travel to Los Angeles to belong to the canton.
The producer accused violently Dr. Stefane Delajoux, the neurocirujan who opened the song of the last 26 November in the International Private Clinic of the Park Monceau, Paris.
We told us that it was a mask.
The Los Angeles' cirujans said they were indignated, Camus declared.
It's talking about a possible question, he said.
John-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday had "laid too fast to Los Angeles with the authorisation of the parish cirujan."
I talked directly to the doctor and he surprised me when he assured that there was no problem to make the trip, because I was operating two times of discreet heritage, he added.
A little before in the emisor, she pointed out that the song seemed to be "unchanged, without canal," after his parish operation.
Dr. Stefane Delajoux is very known in the artistic environment.
He operated the actor Mary Trintgnant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic of Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at that time.
In 2007, I also prohibited the Charlotte Gansburg actries to reannul a hematoma formed by a cerebral heuric.
It is a doctor with bad reputation, condemned by justice in several occasions of malpraxis, as well as by fiscal and stage.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer of the Order of Medicals, accused him to be " a man without secret" requested "in regularity" before the Order Council, and is "lease to be recommendable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stefane Delajoux spoke the Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
It pointed out that the intervention “unseened” and that the results of postoperatory studies were "normal".
"It couldn't cause hemorragies and, taking, he didn't need drenaje," added.
In any way, the road of the song, whose health problems are multiplied since summer, entered into a parestis.
Unfortunately, turning the round on 8 January (in Amians, NDLR) as I was planned, I looked very excited, Camus declared.
UDF Association lies the tonn and advise the New Centre on the use of your silk
The UDF Association (Unie for the French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Muovity) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday before the trial of the President of the New Zentrum, Hervé Morin, to launch a OPA (Public Opening) on the silk of the former giscardist party, intimiding him to remove it from all support, so it is difficult to be requested.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF silk, since he believed that Francois Bayrou was not in position to defend his political heritage after having holded her hand on the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, was planned to confirm the strategie on the Sabbath before the National Council of the NN.
As support for its management, he received aid by the Deputy Hervé de Charte (ex UMP, current NC), which revitalizes the property of the UDF mark, since it was the first to register it in the National Industry Institute in 2004.
But on Friday by the night, the UDF Association office, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to see privates of it, breaked the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the Deputy intimiding them to reject the silk and to transfer them the proper rights of the brand, it is a court demand.
The last days, you have made many statements by calling for your political movement to recover UDF, write the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Alliance Center.
They also believe correctly continue with the name of the movement, the +New Center+, and the slogan +l'UDF of today+ in your military material and on the presentation page of your site, support the subscriptors of the card.
As you already know, they have no right to use the silk, it explains the UDF Office that requires the NN to "without immediately remove the name of the UDF of all support, as well as from (su) Internet site".
He also requests Hervé de Charte "known the property of (la) mark to the lawyers."
Not to do it, it will be appealed to the justice to respect the law and legal rights of UDF members, advertise signings.
In the letter, UDF states that it is a real political movement since 1978 and remember that Morin and his friends were "agained" in 2007 to create a new game, as they already had done others in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Centre has, according to them, no right to use the UDF silk.
They also recall that the last UDF conference voted its accession to MoDem for three years and the creation of a office responsible for defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
With regard to Hervé de Charte, he followed the office, "When he registered the brand," he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years, but the UMP.
Provides slowly and fraudulently the absence of the UDF acronym to perform it through your account.
This indication is transformed in crime, declaring, before the NC strategy bearing: "We believe that in political, such as in life, it is more worthy to do its own name to try to go out of anonimate by taking a name that is not right."

This means that in this case there will be a worthy process of a saga on one of the richest families of France, where mother and daughter are discussed by the sides of the cosmetic imperial The Oreal.
But the Court of Corection No. 15 also assigned that Lyiliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, had been subject to a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The Oreal's main affiliate and principal heritage has always refused to submit these reviews, even in the terms proposed by the Nanterre Fiscality during the investigation.
The doctors designed this Friday should provide a report before 10 March 2010, in which the doctors should be assigned whether Liliane Bettencourt had suffered weakness states and what periods.
I think he'll accept.
I'm talking to her, said the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman, when you go out of the audition.
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, was complained by the Court's decision.
It's an excellent news (...) The loss will show that he (Banier) handed this greater lady, to whom we have to protect.
Since two years ago, the only daughter of Lyiliane Bettencourt started criminal actions against François-Marie Banier, photograph and multifacetic artist, accusing him to have been used during years of his mother's weakness to get thousands of euros in donations, through cheques, life insurance contracts or art works.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt always refused to have been manipulated by the photograph, which is considered a long- data friend.
On Friday, while the court examined the outcome of the action made by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers of the lawyers had a great family confidence in some cases.
In this way, the lawyer of Lyiliane Bettencourt took into account three letters that his client would send (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notice that he said that he had distructed the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for fifteen years.
From your marriage, I never could again talk to Françoise."
For its part, Nanterre's Fiscality considered, once again, that the applicant was not in a position to compare, so much as a judge of protection was denied in these last days to make its request to open a court proceeding for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt " has full capacity to compare justice, is not under protection and has no tutor.
No other person can compare on his place," said the representative of the Public Minister, Mary-Chrsetine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that the judgment on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers would be made once.
Revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the major French enterprises, our fight for the development of business intelligence will be in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the direction of the large enterprises with respect to their employees recall the position of the companies in relation to consumers before the revolution of marketing: it is that partners adhere "values" from above as before it was to impose consumers products thought by manufacturing techniques.
The revolution of the marketing revolution gave him his place to the market purchase strategies... although the authorised attempt to impose products that do not have the preference factors of customers are regularly repaird.
A demobilization of employees can end in death demoralization.
The suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the point of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that affects particularly the executives.
This demobilization has seriously involved the development of all intellectual functions of the company, especially of the I+D and, further, of business understanding.
In fact, the BI (Business Intelligence) " requires that all the involucrated parties (...) have a proactive and prospective vision"; that requires a commitment to the employees who is fully opposed to the recommendations of a authorized direction.
For this reason, we call for a genetical revolution, which would consist to put partners in the centre of business concerns as the customer.
Internal opinion surveys have a relative use
Are you surveys of internal views, such as Orange questionnaire among their assistants, will they provoke the gerenic revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- In principle, because I was able to check that, in the face of a new situation, and after many turns, all the enterprises are finished essentially... what they've always done! B989
- Secondly, because authorism, one of the power pillars, grows proportionally to the importance of their own phrases.
- Finally, because most directives have a simple vision of human behaviour.
As coming from the great engineers schools, they interpretate the psychology in a mechanistic way.
Adoptan, by intellectual comfort, the old conductor theory that the United States Neurocities recently reactivated, and that the student Institutes and the media have widely divided their backs.
In this way, when suggesting that the "commands" (sic) of the executive commitment, a recent investigation of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the directives in a mechanistic management post, unadapted today.
Identify and measurement of mobility factors
In the contrary, the revolution necessary for the good function of modern enterprises is to adopt a final vision of human behaviour.
It is to integrate in any reason or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for the employees, the commitment with the company is only possible if it comes clearly as a means to make a real part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only the future studies from the Motive Analysis take this concept of the motivations of employees.
The studies showed that they judge their company based on a default doctor that allowed them, through the image they have from the company, to assess what it offers to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of the factors of mobilization, enterprise directives can control, prevent and anticipate their "social allocation" and re-evaluate human decentage management "on the place".
In this way, they create a favourable field for the development organized by a strong and effective understanding of business.
Oslo Difficulty: by "right war" Obama receives right elogios
This Friday, the right of North American, satisfied that the Nobel First of the Peace 2009 has defended the concept of “right war” against the United States, announced the speaking that Obama had proclaimed the Thursday.
The conservators, who had disremitted the premium delivery to Obama on 9 October, made this time the presidency's speaking, as Sarah Palin, ex-president to the Vice-President during the elections of 2008.
I loved what she said, explained Ms. Palin, the main image of the right side of the party to republic to the US Journal Today, and added that she himself had addressed the subject of the war "timely necessary" in its recently published memories.
In my view, the war is, since then, the last that the North Americans want to turn to obligation to do, but it is necessary.
There's got to stop terrorists, he observed.
Obama, who heird the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush to Iraq and Afghanistan, said that Thursday in Oslo, to justify the remedie to the force, a way to explain its decision to send more than 300,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days ago.
Another adversary of Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered that the Chairman had made " a very good job" in Oslo.
I think that the discussion was really very well, the former President of the Chamber of Representatives, which was particularly appreciated the “the existence of evil in the world” in the presidency words.
At times, the diction seemed very historically, declared Gingrich, during an interview in the The Takeaway radio programme.
The elected representative, which some consider as a possible candidate to the investor republic for the presidency elections of 2012, was complained with the hearing of " a "one-left president" when he recorded the members of the Nobel Committee " that they would not be free and could be delivered a peace-price if the resources were not existing".
According to Michael Gerson, the author of the speakers of George W. Bush and current chronist in Washington Post, Obama announced "a very North American speaker".
In addition to presenting as a "viddle of the world", as "he always does," he said as a north American President, remembering the Europeans "will live in a security bus that they didn't create and do so much to keep it," said Gerson.
Among the few of the right not very convinced, a hall of the Bush estate, the former embarrassador in the United Nations, John Bolton, calmed the talk of "monoton, pretensive and false inspiration" on the website of National Review Online.
On the left of the President, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was warned to see Barack Obama by justifying the resource to the force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it's easy to justify the mask of innocents, he warned.
However, the press on the left of the center was advertised to the President.
The Angeles Time, although it continued to believe Obama received the Nobel prematurely, he calmed its talk of "superproduction" especially for a speaker known by his talent.
Oslo ' s discussion would serve as a road map to conduct international decisions in combating conflicts, poverty and oppression, as a result of the Californian period.
Obama "agained the word it was necessary," said the New York Times, judged it "a time of sombry and building."
Card transport: three mariatonic negotiations to ensure shipping
After three marathonical negotiations, the incidents of the road sector and TLF (Transport and Logistics), the only patronal organization that remained until the end, reached the Friday afterward to a agreement that ended at the smoothing of the railway and the threat addressed on the ship boat.
During the meeting of signings on Saturday, the secretariat of the transport status, Dominica Bussereau, was "agned" by the agreement, after several negotiations that started the middle of the morning.
After one second night of discussions, the negotiators were disappeared in the Friday square with the hope of soon signing the text of agreement at the last hour ofmorrow.
Even when three patronal organizations (FNTR, Unostra, ODER) were departed by giving a portion.
But a meeting of more than six hours started at 11:00 was necessary to all agree, and the text was signed at 18.00 a.m.
The "hubiese was very detrimental for enterprises" and "we were afraid that the end of the year's feasts were override," Bussereau declared.
The text provides an increase in 4 per cent of lower salary (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9 per cent of the highest (International Transport).
The tariff per hour declined from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for lower wages.
It's not much, but we started with a lot of disasters, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Indeed, we'll order our militarys that there are no shorts or blocks in the centers.
But he can always have some rebelle disconform, added.
Phile Grillot, President of the TLF, recognized that it was "a good agreement", although it was "effective to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to this, the increases will be under the order of 170 per month for lower wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It's a common agreement with awareness and respecting the academies, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized him as "a historical agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is "un acceptable commitment".
In addition, the agreement provides an increase in the expenditure costs of 3 per cent and the celebration of general road transport meetings at the first half of 2010, which will be able to address the issue of an extraordinary payment and the modernization of the collective convention.
Bussereau recalled that "a lower than 100 million euros in the patron loads" was an amendment of the Government in the draft Recommendation Finance Law for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The Government will request the Senate to say the same terms.
The TLF's signing allows the agreement, firstly, to the undertakings attached to this organization and, secondly, to all the profession, if the Minister of Work makes an extension.
It will be "with the greatest shortness," secured Bussereau.
The opposition of patronal organizations could only override the process.
The FNTR announced that it was a “ingenous neighbourhood” because the 100 million euros had been “the sector had been promised to compensate part of the CO2 tax.”
The Secretary of State of Transport has committed us to negotiate in a situation of urgency, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but to not oppose those who want to eat thirst at the next dinner of Nochebuena, the Unitra was lamentated.
For the ODER, the Agreement is under risk "the stability of the sector of the MMEs" for the next 12 months.
RER A: Conflicts during the week end, incidents with RATP proposals
The RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue during the end of the week, because at the Saturday meeting, 2nd day of warming between incidents and the direction of the RATP, there was no agreement and the incidents remained unsatisfactory in respect of its first request.
For this important end of a week buying shipping, the Saturday and Sunday will only circulate trains between 10:00 and 20:00, because of a train of each two in the central trip ( between the Defence and Nation) and a train of each four on the other lines.
The interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will oblige passengers to change train.
The Lafayette Galleries, waiting for 200,000 customers every day, were glad that "the RATP is encouraging to provide service to large tents."
The RER A cross from West to the Paris city.
The RATP is recovered from Saint-Germanin-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Leger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, approximately one of each two trains moved in a point hour, and almost no train in the valley hours, as it was planned.
The Thursday had not been disordinated in the Enens thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the France Island.
Thus, at the alba, the station of Saint-Germanin-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less competited than it normally, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Leger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29-year-old engineer, explained that "a hour and average early to reach time."
The Saint-Lazare station had not been saturated, indicated the SNCF, which had planned the supervision of police and forces of the order.
The RER A operating the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or with destination they arrived or went from Saint-Lazare station to join the metres.
New general workers meetings will be placed on Saturday and Sunday. The results will be analysed, "pour satisfactory" according to the incidents, of a meeting held by the Thursday on the afternoon.
The Director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects of RER A: work time, professional development, etc.
It's not that the leaders want to call for a first that they should, according to Thierry Garon (Sud).
The RATP also sets its first proposals, noted the CGT, noting that the “the direction was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already been solved”.
A new meeting was held in the Monday to carry out "a further analysis on the terms of performance of the profession", the RATP.
What also brought to indigenous persons to say that the company "not imported the users of the week end".
On the morning, some 150 leaders invad a committee at the seat, in Paris.
Then the address, which was rejected until then to dialogue during the wheel, suggested the meeting "for calming waters."
The conflict could extend RER B on Tuesday after the United Nations and the Independents have presented a preavisor.
The incidents require a first of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Southern, Independents) and require the degradation of the working conditions in this line accounting for a million daily passengers.
The leaders of RER, all at the second level of its professional road, cuts from 2.200 to 2.700 euros and from 600 to 650 euros from prices, by changing hours, Sundays and feast days.
Turkish justice dismisses the procured party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court has failed on Friday to dissolution of the country ' s leading part, a decision which immediately caused anger in the forced community, in the Southwest of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could be a lot of compliance with the task of the Government, which has been able to throw his hand to the strong community by trying to put it to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society (DTP) party was deactivated because it had been converted into the "focal of activities that caused the independence of the State and its invisible unit," the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, after four days of discussion.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanim, although only a majority of seven votes were required to obtain the disolution, Kiliç stated that 37 of the leaders of the party, including its President Ahmet Turkk and the Deputy Aysel Tugluk, are members of political life for five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the cease of the parliamentary immunity of which they enjoyed Turkk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the goods of the party by the Tesor.
The DTP contains 21 banks in Parliament (550).
His leaders warned before the jurisdiction that the Members would leave Parliament before being parliamentaries without participation label.
The decision dealt with a procedure launched by the Supreme Court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007, which accused the DTP to obey the ' Principles' of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and by many more countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political escape of the PKK rebels.
However, the party is ensuring that he does not have "organic ventures" with the PKK, but it is refused to calculate it as a terrorist organization and calls for the government to negotiate with him.
The Court's vertebrate is concerned at the time that the Government holds a hand to the forced community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, so that the curses leave to support the PKK and end at the conflict.
The DTP leaders stated that a dissolution could generate a reduction of tensions in the Southwest of the Anatoly, where a large number of manifestations against the terms of detention of the PKK, Abdullah Ecalan, generated with the police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of manifestators gathered together against the locals of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the great quality of the Southwest in their majority by courses.
The Orden Forces throwed the grass of dreams and used water crowns, while the demonstrators launched Molotov bombs or stones with hondas.
In Estambul, there were also hundreds of people concentrated nearly.
After the survey, Turkk confirmed that the decision of justice would "profund the disappearance".
Turkey can't solve this issue (curda, NDLR) by solving a party, declared to the press.
The government, formed by a party coming from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
Firstly, we oppose the closure of matches.
So nothing was resolved, said the Minister of Energy, Taner Yaliz.
This decision boicotees completely the democratic opening launched by the government, commented the political analist Ahmet Insel.
We can, of course, wait for a PKK reaction, added.
This Thursday, the PKK took a attack on which seven soldiers died three days before in the North Turkey, one of the most bloody attacks in the last months.
Nevads can soon begin
A real fresh winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
In absolutely, it is something I want to make the life impossible to the citizens, which is the manager of road maintenance in the winter of the FES
But with this, their employees can learn to prove and dominate the entirety of vehicul technology.
The end of the week may have the meteologs to announce it first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take the snow and ice.
In this case, the FES acts in accordance with a minimum plan.
As soon as the snow in Frankfurt and the temperatures fall under cereal levels, 20 of the called traces A with large salt vehicles, Brauburger explains.
For example, the main artists and adventures such as the New Route and Hanauer Landstraße are included.
But also access to the body of bombers, public transport roads, peatonal areas and we're taking with expectations, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The EES service begins around the three mornings.
It should be covered approximately 1.040 km, as necessary, in a maximum of three hours with hot salt, which is better.
The EESF starts around the three of the madrugate, "with this the ways are free until the movement of the point hours".
The difficult thing is when it begins black at 7:30.
"There we have a problem," he works the winter maintenance director, "for then no one is ready to get out space with salt vehicles."
Immediately later, when it is not wearing, you touch the secondary and private paths, which also includes the Council-Beil-Straße.
The last priorities have side and secondary roads.
This is where the molestians are generated, you know, well Brauburger.
The FES's infantry infantry is mainly disappeared by the dangerous and crucial points.
In general, the FES could not be charged to the total of carriers for bicycles.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, from 22 to 4:30 p.m. he doesn't care about the punts, which works in Brauburger.
As these are turning slide quickly, the salt vehicle is running as soon as temperature falls under two degrees.
In the case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The corner of the dinosaurium
The Tawa found the same aspect as many other carnivor dinosauries: a animal of two metres long and a 1,50 meters of height that runs on the two strong back sides, had an enlarged head with afilled depths and curves, short arms with hairs in shape and a long colt.
If the kind had lived a couple of millions years later, it would not be something special.
But Tawa found was one of the first dinosaurys with these corporal features, inform Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Australia and colleagues in the Thursday Science magazine.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which then was found in a neighborhood of Pangea super-container in the ecuador.
Tawa opened a new window towards the early evolution of the dinosauries, which comes Nesbitt.
It shows us much about geneological relations, dissemination and characteristics of the first dinosaury.
Nesbitt and other paleonólogs started a excavation in the Ranch Spirit in the North of New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we found a tenth of dinosaurium bones, this is something without previous for triastic seats, report Randall Irmis' team of the Museum of History Natural de Utah.
The investigators quickly identified some bones like a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remaining five species were gathered totally.
A foundation confirms theories about the old history of dinosaurus
The name "Tawa" comes from the God of the Sun of the Indian Hopis.
For Sterling Nesbitt is an exceptional finding: "The Triasic dinosaury photos are extremely rare, generally only individual flags are found."
Other experts in dinosauries do not share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectrum, but confirms some theories about the old history of dinosauries, for example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current point of view, the dinosauries appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
But many of the forms of the oldest are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosauries is quite contrary.
For example, the experts discuss, for example, when the sauries were divided in their three most important genealogy lines: the carovors between the Tyransaurus Rex, the Velocirapator and the birds, the four-shapeed saurops known as the " long hole" and their parents, and the Hernithiski herovioses (saurios with ave skull), which include, for example, the species of Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to Nesbitt's analysis and her colleagues, Tawa finds a primary throof.
This shows a interesting combination of primative and progressive progress, combined Nesbitt.
For example, in the Tawa cross, the researchers found indications of air bottles, such as those that also possess the seeds of the thropots, the birds.
Thanks to the air bottles, the respiration of birds is more efficient than the mamiferous.
In the case of Tawa, the bones of the brown column were evidently full of air in part.
Tawa is the most old and primary air bottles, which comes Randall Irmis.
Since the extraordinary line of the post-related saurops were also owned by air bottles and light bones, it was likely that the common prejudices of both groups have already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migratory olives to North America
Since the most primary dinamonds are now known in South America, investigators believe that the saurians arrived there for the first time.
Thus, the three genealogy lines were separated to a start and extended from South America by all the rincons of the Earth, which then still formed a unique earthly mass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team found together with Tawa finds the rest of two other theopods not very improperly.
Three can't descend from a unlike predecessor, the investigators argue.
We believe that at least three migratory olives were given to North America, Alan Turner of the American Museum of History Natural in New York, co-autor of Science.
Of course, there are also opponents.
Another old kind, Silesaurus, who belongs to a brother group of dinosauries, lived in the current Poland, prepared the Bonn Martin Sander paleonologist.
Your view could give a distortioned image because simply in South America are still maintaining many dinosauries photos, while in other continents there are still something to discover.
The question of how the dinosaurus achieved a relatively co-balance line of the reply to the dominant earthquarters of Mexico remains an enigma.
While, in the Triastic, the dinosauries were still shared their vital space with many other reptiles, for example with the ringers of current cocodrors and psterouries and many other sauries.
Before the end of the Triastic, the dinosauries were expanded around the world and developed many new species, while the parent was extended to the territory to the Jurisdiction.
The outcoming storys were not forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, comment Martin Sander.
It could be given a massive extinction to which the dinosauruss survive by casuality, but other reptiles not.
Or the dinosauros were better adapted, so they could win the contingents in the area.
Exit storys are not always eternal.
150 million years later, an impact of meteority shot the increase of a group of species, which had also been evolved in the Triastic and since there were a miserable existence: the mammiferos.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is wide and international signatories.
Participant professors of the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California.
Attractors of Napoles, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police disappearance of the Casino occupied university of Frankfurt replicated around the world.
278 Teachers and Cathedralists of the University of Goethe, even though also of higher education centres in all Germany, Europe and North America, are solidary with students in the Westend Campus.
In a German and English declaration, "rechain" the police disaster promoted by the directive.
Werner Müller-Estler, President of the University, disbursed the work of students and teachers in education, because the walls and art work were covered by propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered lessons.
Material damage, judge subscriptors, do not justify "la violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and catadrates by a police command".
The disaster represented an "unacceptable attack" to the freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive approach in the Vandalism served for "delegation and criminalization of the protest" and dismissed the attention of the content.
The directive has been refused to cover the necessary negotiations.
The teachers require the immediate retirement of the proceedings.
Most employers have not caused material damage, it is said.
Protestation legitimate
Gentlemen of the Green Sindicato and the German Federation of Sindicatos are solidary with students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of an increased concern by its own future, the national youth secretariat of Verdi, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kohne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Sciences of Hesen, however, defended the act of the university and police director.
We are grateful to the university director.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, the Thursday in the Parliament of the province of Wiesbaden.
We are understood with the protest, but we are not understanding with the Vandalism, Peter Beuth expressed the provincial parliament by the CDU.
The view of the opposition factors, the SPD, the Green and the left is different.
The CDU used the walls painted to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler expressed.
Instead of studying the arguments and requirements of students, they are disappeared.
The Children has presented a motion in which the Minister of Interior was requested to submit a report on the police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
During many years, it was considered a secret city that was not accessible to the West visitors.
Quietly, one of the ten districts of Moscú was a Soviet Union a strongly retained site for the secret arms investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, situated at 37 kilometers from the Moscow centre, is considered as the Russian "Silicon Valley".
There are important research and production centres of micro and nanaelectrónic.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogrado contacted Riedberg's research office in Frankfurt, university institutions and companies of Frankfurt's innovation Centre.
There were several visits from each other and now, the Miércoles, Selenogrado and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a "Streak Cooperation Protocol".
The Vice-Alcalde Moscovita Juri Rosljak and the Head of Selengrado, Anatoly Smirnov, entitled Russian delegation; Frankfurt signed the Chief of Edwin Black Planning Services.
In 2010, they will travel to a seminary in Selenogrado representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises from the natural research centre.
Science Interchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
The FIZ companies will have the opportunity to put foot on the growing Russian market.
In turn, Russian scientific enterprises want to have access contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the seat of major firms and Russian research institutions.
Among them, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronic consorts.
The community was founded in 1958 as the "Society Planning Ciuda" for Arms Research.
Selenograde (traditionally translated as "Green Ciudad") received its name from the forest mountain landscape, where investigation plants were reached.
Stuttgart Footers
Stuttgart 21's size is not placed for anything sufficiently high.
The project's partners are simple and clearly "the new heart of Europe".
I know the law. S21 is much more than the reduction of a rail station, more than a monstery construction project, which will be involved in the capital of the Banden-Württember region a tenth of unremovable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 was surrounded by the wind of 1980.
Terminals with riles, who end in the middle of the city, were considered at that time of engineering photos of the XIX century, who acted as slights of a modern rail traffic, since it was anti-requestly needed a huge amount of time to income the back-offs.
Rodar, open on the seat continue the trip; but it must be done.
And why they had to disappear the terminals: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a step station, which is approximately half of the trans-European operation lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; from there the Slogan of Europe.
The S21 will actually be initiated, although the visions in the 1980s will no longer be compatible with the reality.
Even the most ambitious designers knew that in Hessian and Bavara’s capitals is almost impossible to implement reduction.
Of course, rail terminals do not have any more income and exit problems since there are renewable places with tractor and chariot units of the conductor in both extreme.
However: Stuttgart 21, including the new ICE built stage towards Ulm, will already be started.
The Federal and Communal Politicians are so planned.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the large individual infrastructure projects of the Republic will contribute to them and not the State.
From the urban point of view, the project is still justified to a certain point.
A new urban space is created, providing from many green areas, probably from the graphics generated by the computer of the designer.
For the rail transport system, S21 is crazy.
The past station and vital support are considered for the transport of people, which has been granted to the wide typical growth of the 1980s.
That was not the competence of lower cost flights.
But modern transport policy should first be taken to strengthen the transport of goods, since rail transport is significantly more ecological than shipping on roads.
However, the new buildings are good for load trains because of the intensist gradients.
The S21 also affects indirectly many other rail projects.
More than six million euros should be buried in the Zuavos.
This is the official number.
Experts consider that it is more realistic between 10 and 15 million.
It is sure that in the next decade the money will be missing in other traces and traces on the network.
In the list of the Ministry of Transport are more than sixty-seven projects.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometres of long riles through the Rin valley.
Since 1987 the treatment to slow step is built.
It would be urgent here to break the accelerator as it is because.
However, S21 acts as a crazy.
The tray of the Rin valley will be the bottle of bottle for international goods transport: through the heart of Europe.
The Government considers the judgment on aircraft.
The Federal Government will leave the autonomous parliament of Wiesbaden, if you will submit an appeal proceedings to the fall on the prohibition of night flights from Hesse's administrative court.
The coalition of CDU/FDP seems to be undertaken to experts of the legal investigation of the sentence of the VGH, more than 400 pages, as said by the Minister of Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel was written at this date, that in the case of the construction of the north-west aircraft planned in the Frankfurt airport, the faithful state should again regulate the prohibition of night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as prescribed by the Federal Government, would not be agreed with the legal protection of the people of the voice because of the aircraft.
The coalition must decide until 4 January, if it is required to submit an appeal procedure against this judgment.
The opposition criticised this postergation and pressed the representatives of the Government to grant the appeal remedies to the Administrative Court of the nation in Leipzig.
The Chief of the SPD Group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect its vows of prohibition of the night aircraft, which had been performed before the elections. On the other hand, it could be taken as a lack of word.
It's pretty difficult if one let him fulfill his word, said the Head of the Green Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We do our word."
The Minister Posch rejected the recrimination of Schäfer-Gümbel, that the Federal Government would be attempting by the terms of law and trucks still in order to obtain its night flights.
A comprehensive legal investigation would need enough time.
The coalition wouldn't want to act on the basis of a "a fast printing".
We need a legally intellectable decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As it represents the opposition, they would never have been confirmed by their group concerning the prohibition of night aircraft.
United States banks return aid.
The large United States banks from the crisis are disappeared from their state attacks.
The "Bank of America" returned only the aid provided to the Tarp bank reimbursement fund of a total of 45,000 million euros (approximately 30,000 euros).
And the Citi Group is also planned to resume state aid, according to a report of the United States CNBC.
The institutions intend to be released from the restrictions that had been gone from the hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation in the payment of bonus to the directors, as well as the payment of high rates.
The "Bank of America" had been achieved approximately 19 million money liquid through convertible goods.
The rest of the sum took it from the own box, which had enough means, among others for the sale of rocks.
Managing Director Kenneth Lewis thanked the middle of the night to the US contributions: financial injection helped to overcome very difficult moments.
The banking house was badly calculated by the efforts of the absorption of the investment bank in the financial crisis.
The Citi Group also intends to gain money in the capital market to be released from its obligations against the State.
CNBC informed the source of known circumstances that the United States Bank could already announce the increase in its capital for $20 million.
A representative of the Citi Group did not want to comment.
In June, they had already returned their goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley's support.
Quick selection
Finally, everything was faster than she thought.
Past two weeks after the Administrative Board of the ZDF ( German television canal) is presided to the Chief Nikolaus Brender to leave its post, the channel can present a successor.
Yesterday, the Gremium was intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, principal ZDF study director in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the issuer, officially to not prejudice to the procedure.
But certainly, it also affected the no longer damage to the Director of the Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be adopted in the Administrative Board.
Frey, the Schächter candidate, needs nine children's 14 members.
The result of the vote was not yet concrete by the closure of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter expressed his proposal to renew for more than five years the Nikolaus Brender contract.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's destitution was a gentle flock for Schächter, but a fracase that could be waited.
The majority of the Union in the Administrative Board already weeks before the election had indicated that they would not support Brender at its post.
The opposition against the head of redaction was organized by the Chairman of the Hesse Government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He decreased another mandate of the Chief of Formation with the argument that, under Brender ' s direction, the CDF information had been lost hearing indices.
Until a few years before the elections had been protests because of this, which frauded the political influence on ZDF.
Finally, 35 specialists in public law were introduced in the debate, which were qualified by Koch as unconstitutional.
But he didn't serve anything.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
It was political, pedagogy and Romanian philology.
Then he worked in the "Suddwestfunk" emisor and in the "Frankfurter Rundview".
In 1983, it changed the "heute-journal" information.
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 staff rapporteur of the Head of Editing; 1991/92 corresponsal in Washington; until 1998 director and manager of the morning programme "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of the external policy of ZDF; from then director of the ZDF study in the capital.
The Green political party announced a constitutional demand after the constitution of Brender, which was still elected as a periodist of the year by the magazine of "Medium Magazin".
On the contrary to Koch in the Administrative Council, the President of the Government of Renania-Palatinado explained the past week that the federal states should change the State Convention of the TDF as such, that the proposals for staff of the director could not be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A retirement of participatory policy of ZDF control groups was detained by Beck.
The likely successor of Brender, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended before the administrative advice with an intellectual player: he cried strongly to the gremium for the constitution of Brender.
Thanks to this periodic independence test, both Schächter, it could be appointed for the head of redaction without losing the face, as the Administrative Council could vote it, without having the suspect of give it the post to a particular sequence.
In the calculations of the Frey Parts, it is adjudicated in all forms to the left frees.
University roads are deployed
Part for students: After a year of feeding education, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Development of the states finally concluded. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Training with university recruits, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in licensing and further cases.
Students in a future should be able to overcome their roads.
For example, it was agreed in reducing the exam load: basicly each road module must end with only one review.
Furthermore, it is intended to consider the load of students' work, and it is wanted to ensure a "real and fair medium".
Policy and universities will also simplify the recognition of results of reviews between universities within and outside Germany.
The faithful states are engaged in more flexibility with structural rules for Bachelor and Master Carriers.
Regulations of the faithful states that differ from this, should not be already exist.
Examples
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Development and the university recruiters continue to speak on the improvement of the capacity of carrying out and successfully concluded a course (studibility).
Now for the first time he spoke of a specific content.
The so-called recognition Board agreed to reduce the amount of reviews: "Every module ends with a single review" is said in a 30-page document, which seeks to regulate partly the adoption of the university routes.
With the "sensible reduction of the exam load" it is intended to avoid development in a wrong direction, which would significantly affect the sustainability, thus explained the Director of the Creditation Board, Mr Reinhold Grimm.
In addition to the future, the "studibility" must be the decisive criteria in the configuration.
Modules and contents should be examined completely regarding the unnecessary restrictions of students in the election of.
The courses.
Students would have "the right to get more spaces, potential and enhance their own initiative."
These rules would be valued for new routes, but also in the existing rail review.
These should be "recovered" every five years again. But this would mean, that would be late until 2015 to consider all the roads.
The responsibility of this would be at the whole of the country of 10 credit agencies, which are under the supervision of the Creditation Board, installed by the relied states.
Ministers of Education and Cultural Training encouraged the faithful states in October to influence such a way in the agency, that the amount of materials and reviews would not be too stretch or required.
In some faithful states universities and technical schools already agreed with the ministry to take such measures.
Until now, Renania-Platinad has been provided to facilitate additional means for the following development of the Bolivia process.
With this money, universities should implement programmes of tourism and student advice, as well as strengthening exams and outside offices.
The Federal State and universities intends to be 10 million euros for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010, the Government wants to bring the parliament a news of the university law.
According to it, a single review should be sufficient for the finalisation of a carrier model.
The road settings should be more flexibility, as well as the recognition of evaluations in other universities and the accessibility of Master.
Until the end of the year it is intended to consider all the roads about their "studibility".
These Thursdays the Government and opposition discussed the conditions of study in the faithful state.
The elections also have been critical about decisions.
At the Federal Governance Council of the University Groups of Juso Socialists, it was necessary that the configuration of educational policy should no longer be carried out by "tocked doors" of the Ministers and university recruits.
At the latest after educational gaps, the students should also be able to think.
The President of the University Records Council (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave him support to students: "We need the experience of students," said the Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which HRK issued a joint reform document.
For the education and science incident (GEW) Bonn agreements were not all sufficient: the incident requires legal law for each student with the Bachelor title the possibility of access to a post-master road.
Furthermore, the faithful states need to ensure that for the current generation of students in Bachelor, there are sufficient studies for Master with the best possible study conditions, and that has been informed by a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The faithful states have to meet some more teachers.
But about a greater access to the most, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than one foot note about Herta Müller
"Come and get from Germany is practically without control" says the first line of a poem of the Luxury Werner Söllner in disgusting idiomic flags, which the experiences of arrival to Germany lived by a deputy, who had won his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked the principle as German and English professor in Bucarest, and then as a reader in a child book editor before moved to Frankfurt in 1982.
In 1993, Söllner gave several literature premies, the memorable lessons or poesia lections in Frankfurt University of Goethe, and since 2002 he was a director of the Hesse literature Forum in Moustourm in Frankfurt.
God who speaks quite the past Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "The German Laterature in Romania in the spectrum and the spectrum defined by his officers of security"
Obviously uncertain and contempted, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted the participation as IM in the Roman secret service Security against German-Roman writers, among other Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Womendorfer.
Along with some of the presents in 1989, Söllner had received the German Prime in the language.
Related attempts had been slowly started at the beginning of 1971.
"Therefore I am one who was not sufficiently defended against the cause of provocation of security," Söllner concluded.
Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
At the same time as the concessing of the Nobel Price of literature to Herta Müller and its literature polymics without equal to the dictated field mechanisms, the literary scene and, in particular, the community of German authors originated in Romania for a case of evidence of the abismos and maliciousness of a political system, based on control and speech.
Werner Söllner is, why you know until now, not only author, but also victim.
In his expert of Securency IM Walter had played a role, said Michael Markel's scientist literary after Söllner's confidence, and turned the positive influence for him by the IM Walter.
He had been excused or defended in all the difficult points for him, said Markel.
"I feel the moral need to be confirmed," said.
The Söllner declaration in this form and faced this public was unexpected, the confidence of an ex-ident and its work with the Roman secret service, however, is not so surprised.
Germany would have been a comforted refuge for spices of the Security-Spitzel, written Herta Müller already in July in the week "Time" after reading his own post from 914 pages.
The involucrated will certainly be speculated and will be known in some cases, what names they would be hidden behind Sorin, Vicu and Walter's seeds.
On the difference of the review of officials of Stasi with a procedure controlled in Germany, the treaty with the security control officers is still a little bit.
A systematic clarification was seen boicoteed and difficult in the past years.
A national advice for the experts of the security officers (CNSAS), in accordance with the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of officers from then is more delivered to rasters.
Since 2005, there is a law which regulates the administration of officials.
An interview, after the concessing of the Nobel Price of literature to Herta Müller, proves that the impact of old members of the security in Rumania is still very large. In this interview, a former man of the Temesvar Safety talked despectively about the condecoration.
"They has psychosis," at the end they just asked her once.
The unfamilyness of the power seemed to be able to show without turn in the form of liberty of opinion.
Of course, there are inevitable questions with case Söllner, as many times when there are calling faults.
Why right now? Who has been harmed? The calmed reaction of the hearers against the confidence of Söllner will hope that the continuation of this story will be ruled more by the fears of knowledge and not so by the condemnation of faults and contempts.
For the genie of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Price of literature, is more than a simple note at foot.
The Campeon Liga as guarnition to fill the stage
When the new steelball VfB team of Stuttgart, Christian Gross, with a narrow-plastic plastic box of the provider of its team, addressed a Mercedes taxi of the Klaus C a fourth hour after the middle of the night, was the impression that a member of the elegantly clothed outer service would have come out of a very pleasant celebration of Navidad, in which the manufacturer of comparative articles had been divided.
The man of the heat characteristics had bound a chopher because he had not yet known the city.
Otherwise, it would also be able to lead the car itself: at the end of accounts, he had no alcohol in the game, and he was not earlier for 55 years.
It was a nice room, but tomorrow would start the work again.
Or he was starting for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, which had been contracted at least three days before: "It's true that we reached the eight of the end", i.e., in the Camperons Liga, thanks to the trionf 3:1 against Unire Urziceni, in Romania, "although we can't let us go through the success: we're gonna have to fight brutally against the decline."
The "the most important term" was waiting for them on Sunday next, confirmed.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat the success of the "real classs" in the quotidianity of the liga.
And eliminating the weaknesses that have been clearly demonstrated again, after the three rapid goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sorting
The eight ends of the Camperons Liga (Ida 16/17 and 23/24 February/Returned 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be held on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy was limited by the lighting entrance of the Babbel Successor.
Not only in the salvator's case, which was soon inspired to the uncertained professors of Stuttgart confidence in himself, available to be delivered and well-being for the game.
I was with the players and I told them they had to concentrate on their strong points, I set them to be lower, explained the Gress repair of the success that so easily sounded, but that with the Babbel therapeuta had no effect.
He deployed a certain magic, accepted Babbel's Party, Jens Lehmann, "When on the bottle a new impuls, sometimes happens things that wouldn't have been believed."
And Sami Khedira, who after a stop of several weeks a lesson came afterward to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomen" concealed with the "see fresco" and the form of work of the new head: "He is a man who intervive at the fund, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And that's what was missing, obviously, when he was a baby.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet been tested, advise the Horst Heldt.
But the VfB Stuttgart needs all the condition.
Like Gross, the players and the manager were also resolved to overlook the triunfo against a defence detaineed because of the lack of loans and totally delayed by Roman invitations.
They also gained in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 had come to the triumph of disappearing, he told Khedira thinking.
And the Governor Horst Heldt warned that, although it had reached an objective of the time, the other was still far.
We haven't still over the problem.
That Heldt had no gain to celebrate in his birthday 40, even after the first victory in his home three months since the end of the week end, which returned to update as a television interview transmitted right before the start of the game, which had been granted by the portor Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions to take others, and not Jens, Heldt faced the hard critic of Lehmann.
This was deficient in the direction of the Guideline, which was decided to change internists by the pressure of adolescents.
Also that his free day was removed after the games, Lehmann calfied it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
The statements of Lehmann were "managed by the pure egoism," repuse Heldt, and announced consequences for the seeer.
Maybe they're no friends forever, the two quarters.
But at least they had agreed with all the others that, without the pre-consequent efforts with the team of the replaced internator, it would not have been possible for the spectacle of great game and battle.
Babble and his assistants had "a significant participation in success", said Heldt and Lehmann to the union; and he was also agreed to the man of the plastic wound.
World weight campeonate of weights
Another duelo in Berna: one and again the Kevin Johnson Remote was provocating the Vitali Klitschko global campaign with words and managers.
But after twelve long rounds, the Ukrainian defended its title of weight in the WBC version.
The judgment of judges was unanim.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains a world weight campaign.
The 38-year-old campaign in the WBC version of the Friday night in Berna to the United States Kevin Johnson by a single decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko was its third defence from its return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was two-time global campaign of WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it couldn't be able to make the noise that they were all waiting.
Klitschko increased its balance to 39 triunfos in 41 professional pills, two times had to be delivered because of his lessons.
The recorder Johnson had to accept the first decade in his 24-year-old.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Berna Area, Klatschko, with a station of 2.02 metres, I want to tell the swimming pool on the left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters lower, which before the dull had proclaimed the end of the was Clitschko, was driving out one and again from the attacks of the world campaign, so Clitschko could not decisively lead to his goal.
In general terms, the passenger Johnson did too little for a poster, and he just tried to pass the rounds.
Although he was provocing Klatschko with words and managers, his slaughters were only rarely reached to the world campaign.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who drew twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the wheel, the pillar had already produced a real scanning in the Swiss capital.
He was insulted Klitschko as "horrable zombie," that "not knows anything to do."
When wearing the weeds, the campaign had been provoked to sight to take Johnson's skills from the narz "to see his eyes."
Four weeks after the return of Klatschko
On October 11, 2008, Klitschko was also inventive.
After a stop of almost four years, he came in that time to the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and was recovered "su" the WBC cell, which had to be delivered without skin.
This year after his title was come to John Carlos Gómez, from Cuba, and in September to Chris Arreol, of the United States.
In this skin I just received a bit, and I'm in very good physical condition, he explained Clitschko his speed back to ring.
But your dream remains meeting all the four important titles in their family.
Her brother Vladimir is a global campaign of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the cytoon belongs to the British David Haye, after it was released in November to Nikolai Valujev, from 2.13 metres of station.
In the previous summer, Haye had canceled a battle against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
The company which promotes it is already planning the fight against Clitschko in the Wembley Station of London.
The client's case
The front attack of the opposition: the Chief of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, called the mentirose Minister of Defense, Goodenberg, because of false information on the question of the Kunduz.
SPD and the left-owners require clarification to the canciller.
Hamburg/Berlín – After the recent revelations on the Kunduz air attainment, the opposition rejected him to the Minister of Defensa, Karl-Theodor to Goodenberg (CSU), who has deceived cause knowledge.
In the emission of the "TagesView" of the Sabbath news, transmitted by the ARD TV channel, the chief of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the Minister "the Sweden didn't say the truth" on the mortal bombarded of two convoys.
In a case so, it is usually said: he said lie.
The order of killing would be given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Trupp for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report I had OTAN, and he read Mr. Goodenberg, said Trittin.
The Thursday was recognized that in this attack it was not only trying to destroy secured vehicles, but also to kill two Taliban leaders.
In the United States aircraft, requested by the German Commander of Kunduz, the small coronel, in accordance with the report of the OTAN investigation, died or were leaving up to 142 people.
The Greens, the SPD and the left encouraged the Federal Canciller Angela Merkel (CDU) to proclaim himself immediately before the federal parliament and to explain what Goodenberg actually knew about the incident.
Mrs. Merkel needs to clarify whether an intensive murder strategy is part of the federal government policy of Afghan, and whether the cancer, the army and the information service have adopted this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and his colleague of the Green Renate Konast.
Ulrich Wilhelm, the government portrait, decidedly rejected the criticism.
The cancellar did not affect any of the specific actions of the German Army in Afghanistan, said.
The Sabbath had also been doubts about the presentation made by the Ministry on the reasons for the deployment of the General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL information, they were both informed to Goodenberg correct and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
It was officially said that they had rejected the existence of OTAN reports and had hided details of crime to the Minister.
However, since the environment of the two high-range staff, they had also mentioned the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a document of two pages of the Small Coronel, which was on the hand, and a report of a field card.
Understanding, Wichert would have requested in a letter to explain the matter, reports the "Frankfurter Generaler Sonntags periodung".
Until the time he has not received reply, it was said.
The Ministry has not been shown on the Sabbath regarding the replies made by it, and noted that this would be explained in the Federal Parliament Research Commission, which will be formed on the next Wednesday.
Onyrical mouths
In watch condition, some people see images and hear voices that others don't see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental diseases and drugs are disappeared between imagination and reality.
When it happens during the dream, everything is in order.
When we are located in our dark rooms with the closed eyes, we can be delivered without the most saved imaginations and creatures of the fantasy.
However, who experiments states similar to dream during the watch, or see and hears things that others don't see or hear, is considered most of the times in modern Western world as a place or drug, or at least as a manual.
But such images and voices are not only on mental sick or on drugs.
The fault has our imagination: the same neutral processes that allow us to design houses, paint tables or write news, sometimes they make the limits between the dream, the dark and the reality.
We call them visions, and in worse, worse.
Although you can distinguish the decade and effects, the visions of the Hildegard of Bingen, the psychodelic experiences of the prophet of the New Era Carlos Castañeda, the Chamanic property states, and psychics and alucinations.
Alucinations or delirios are surrounded when the balance of the neutral communication substances in the brain has been disappeared – above all dopamine, northernalina, serotonin and acetylcolina – and is perturbed by interaction between different parts of the same.
During a psycosis of the skizofreenic skills are very frequently compared with complex alucinations and in placed thoughts.
The gravity has no power over him
The relationship between the dream and the dream has occupied philosophes and doctors from the old time.
Aristotet them had the alucinations as a dream form of watching state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry founders, founded in 1861 a "growth seed of the lower state with the onional states," by Sigmund Freud, the dream was also " a psychistic, with all the disproposite, alocated trainings, and speises of it."
It's October 2001, when Henning T. becomes a coic figure.
Your body is two dimensions, and heavyly colored.
The gravity has no power over him, it is flying near the teeth of the room.
He feels a patate.
After him, the figures of demons with wings, with red muckles like blood, deforms, recycling the gods.
They follow him, wear it with weak and flattering boats, they throw it against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
Easy and evil voices rise from the walls and the radio.
You can't support them, the voices that blaspheme him and offend him.
Henning T. takes two cables of the season, the lake to form a smooth nest, and set them in a winter in the kitchen.
He goes up in a kitchen and puts the cloud around the kitchen.
Come on.
Remembers her.
What you're doing for election!, crying your voices in a corner that turns the typicals, "ved the clinic and make you cure!"
Now, Henning T. has 40 years and has experimented six psychics, the last two years ago, the first one almost 20 years ago.
The cause that producer was the LSD.
Your diagnostics is psychistic-afective-paranoid, also is menaco-depressive, taking medicinal products, against depression, mania, skizofreinia.
He learned to live with his disease, has been married for three years.
In the psychism I experienced the most terrible threat and the deepest despersion, says.
Alucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls in disease at least once in the life of skizofreen; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most frequent disease after depression.
In an approximate skizofreen psychistics, most of the times the affected are no longer able to distinguish between the external world and the internal world, and fall in an exhibition status that can lead to alucinations, delisions of greatness, transfers in the relationship, or managing.
Specially extended is found to hear voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Often the optical alucinations are best.
The affected is no longer capable of distinguishing what it is not, the brain can no longer filter the perturbing signs, the conscience is expected from impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the stores to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest captions of conscience.
The recognition of the reality in the psychosis is focused on the subject, says Thomas Fuchs, Chief of the general psychiatric clinic of Heidelberg University hospital.
The skizofrenico is located in the centre of events, everyone has a meaning towards him.
At the same time he enters into a passive role, like in a dream, feels abrupted by events and can't organise them actively.
This is why the skizofrenicos are often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general, it is not possible to adapt the reality to them, the alucinations are a cruel reality, the disappearing, unable.
Have experimented an alucination once in life
In contrast to a dream, Fuchs says, "the space and sensual structure of the reality that are in psychistics remain in principle that."
Paranoic thoughts and alucinations are supported in reality, detention of experience has been done in reality.
For the investigators, it's still unconscious why our brain makes the heads.
According to the functions, the exceptional states may lead to any person to lose contact with the provisional reality.
But not all people develop psychism.
It seems to be a genetic provision for skizofreen, but gemeles studies have shown that there are also other specific factors.
Researchers suggest that the affected suffer minimum cerebral damage.
We are surprised that the neuronal madurance of the brain is affected in an early stage of development, such as by a lively disease of the mother during the wedding, Fuchs explains.
But it remains unrecognised how this change of the neuronal system is produced, which also does not be absolutely manipulated for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays a significant role – stress or traumatic experience may be the detonants of a psychism when there is already a previous disposition.
Likewise, alcohol drugs can cause psychism as they interfere in the brain transmittor system.
When the brain is warm
The illustration of all this is that the psychic people suffer with their alucinations and take very cut medicines to save themselves from them, while others pay on drugs that allow them to experiment some, says the catalytics in Erich Kasten psychology, from Lübeck.
It is drawn as a pleasure or does not frequently depend on the view point.
Kasten collected 10 years ago reports on alucinations and visions and has analyzed the results in the book The irregular world in our head (The irregular world on our head), published in the past year.
Alucinations are found among the typical symptoms of psychosis but also, surprisingly, of other many diseases.
Among them are, together with psychical transactions such as the cross-border limit of personality or depression, with often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multilingual scleroses, Alzheimer and rare transumatisms.
as surprised and in certain circumstances, the brain of healthy people also suffers alucinations.
The alucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of records that usually are repressed.
Besides when the brain areas in which sensors are processed are hyperactive or are little cohibied; when our brain is warm, but also when there are no styles.
Drugs can provoca this state in the same way as cerebral damage or psychism.
But also the restriction of styles, stress, the evil of love or other cerebral states of exception.
In recent studies, one third of the applicants had experienced at least once in life a halluzination.
During the summer of 2005, Sarah K. had 16 years old, lived in a small city of Mecklenburg-Pomerania West and attended a secondary education collection.
A funny girl.
If not through these images and voices.
Sometimes, during the recreation, it appears that a boy goes with a long hair and dark leads him the word.
When she answers, the other students look at her surprised; no one, part of her, hear or see the boy.
They think the lady girl is a little strange teacher, but Sarah K. You know he's not dreaming.
She's sleeping and walking and listening to that guy, the same way you see and listens to the girl sitting on the bank on the side.
You can even feel your presence, at least some moments.
It's a nice feeling, you like the boy.
Sometimes he asks if she's shot.
It also knows that the boy and the rest of visions are not real and they are disappearing.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
visions are often a load.
When he is in class, you can't follow the selection because the professor – to his eyes and ears – is presenting a new fellow, while for the rest it explains visible and listening the mathematical evaluations.
At night, the appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room to reach the dream, which many times comes after and is slow, you don't know whether you're disappointed or dreaming, if the pictures you see, museums or girls with bloody knees in arms and pitches, they appear in front of their open or closed eyes.
Leave me in peace, cry them to the figures.
His parents and friends didn't tell them anything, they would think she's shot.
October 2009, Sarah K. has 20 years.
He adopted the past year selectivity and lived with his husband.
A year ago the alucinations disappeared.
Since you entered into contact via Internet with the Kasten psycholog, you know that it isn't weak.
Lower is also an art work for dispersion.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffering a restriction of styles, it is very likely that after a time it begins to have an alucinations.
I think the brain is unemployed and is responsible for finding interviews.
Sarah K., the only daughter, had a little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His pulmony began when, with 13 years, it was recognized that the man who called the dad since he used the reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acustic alucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that are also processing real and red impressions, those affected as Sarah K. It is difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience", says Kasten, "bear place in the brain, the reality is projected there.
The alucinations are also images that the brain produces, therefore they look so real."
Kasten also classifys night fantasies as a form of alucination.
The alucinations of healthy persons do not differ in the main part of the psychistics.
On the contrary to the skills, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as irregular.
Kest is therefore recommended to their patients that appreciate their pulmonary as a special ability.
Limitation between dream and alucination
In this world is too focused on the consciousness, the imaginational experiences are generally patologizing, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Cathedral in Heidelberg and Heidelberg Chief of the psychiatry clinic and psychological treatment of the hospital Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
A psychism is a severe and severe disease but that also affects something positive and creative – the loud is an art work of dispersion.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the named unionism, a special form of conscience, which is like if it was a dream.
Onional aluminiums are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who considers real and then cannot differ from being disappeared.
In extreme circumstances related to traume or disease, such as patients with polyrradicle Europe, who experience a parliasis that is completely conscious.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by loss of one or the world because of a total and permanent motor incapacity, it replaces a very dangerous situation by a own and imaginary world that is disappeared from the reality.
A shape of limited situation between dream and alucination.
Since a situation in the reality is not possible, a change in the world is produced, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way to give sense and interpretation to an inadequate situation that our own creation capacity allows us not to fall into nothing of awareness loss.
All is real, even later in memory
Moreover, the artist's art Peter Cornelius Claussen, of Zürich, describes his unional experiences in his heart book changed as an action for salvation of the soul.
It was 49 years old, when his conscience was embarked in several days after a operation of the cardian vampires with heart transplant, while his body was condemned to immobility in the stage of intense care.
Claussen joined a world created by himself and visited foreign places of other times: he saw places posted on the bed, a greater man on the boat of a sanitary in a train, a robot wanted for his health.
It was seen in the High Media Edad, rolled by nobles that produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motion followed him in his country of origin, made surf on his hospital bed in the Alpes with firm snow and found a corean maff.
It gives all in these imaginative facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Clussen, these internal travels are mainly different than any dream.
Slaughter is a different state, so describe your experience.
In contrast, the memories of mental trips are, many years later, much more clear, even in irregular details.
More clear and intense, even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilues the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds the Schmidt-Degenhard psychiat.
Finally, the oneurism, psychisms, alucinations and consumption of drugs show the fairness that is the internal reproduction of external reality, even when we are disappeared.
Any change in the state of conscience, resume the Kasten psychologist, "I can bring to a deformation of what we call reality."
A experience that, on the other hand, can be fully enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
Children will be responsible for the editor for 27 years
The new editor Kallen has reached a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in hands of its two children, has come to SPIEGEL.
100 per cent of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – The Hubert Burda editor sees its business in hands of his children in the future.
The two children become in heritage with 27 years and have the strong desire to enter into the company, confirmed Burda from 69 years in SPIEGEL.
Details have been corrected as a precaution measure.
The following question is whether they are actively involved in the company.
Also, if they are trained for that.
One can't lay before 7,500% of their children, if they are not sufficiently trained for it.
It would end with the children and also with the company.
Burda had known the Thursday that will be departed from January from the presidency of the Directional Meeting and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This family member of Kallen, from 1999, is a member of the Burda address.
It was responsible for technology in a beginning.
Further, he was engaged in the teacher and with this the responsibility of the company's heritage. After the exit of Jürgen Todenhöfer was also charged by direct marketing, foreign, printing and finances.
For the first time, no family member occupies the neighbourhood of the editor.
The children of Burda were 19 and 17 years old. Her son Felix, who would now have 42 years ago.
Kallen's design also serves to " save the differences of 10, 15 years", according to Burda.
100 per cent of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With the view on the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffle, Burda showed that family companies were not free of the decade: "I always affected families that have been contained by the capital searching abuses that have been judged badly and thought that they could be high as well as the greatest player.
It's never been my strategy.
I never had "Grace Delirios", says Burda.
I don't see me as a political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play with the "Time" in the world link; these business have been done too large.
Integral clarity
Everything that-- on the matter of beauty and well-- you can want, at the distance of your hand.
This seems to be proposed by the English Court, which has been inaugurated in Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of over 1000 m2 dedicated to care and mix of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth plant, accounting for prestigiouses such as Hedonai - which is responsible for the Laser-; Spaxion, with relaxation and treatment rooms; Luis & Tachi Peluqueros; Marina d'Or, which has a gimnasium, or the Occitane, and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food section, in which it notes the theery, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Availing a relaxing mass with your couple while viewing the inhabitable views of the capital, or take for two hours the relaxing area to accommodate your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relaxing you with a jacuzzi meeting, mass and take a campan cop are some of the opportunities offers Spaxion.
In total, 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and newest facial, corporal and hydrothermy treatments.
As, for example, cavitation to fight celulitis or vibratory platforms.
The gimnasium also takes into account these machines, besides some virtual drivers that will lead the steps of the customers, offering them fully custom treatment.
Everything started introducing your personal key in a tactic screen located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to do correctly our performance table.
His director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and smoothing) are sufficient to execute all the muscles of the body.
And, if after executing our body, we want to pass through the pillar, the sign Luis & Tachi has a room where the hair recovery, lightness or personal nutrition are offered.
innovation and exclusiveness seem to have been the premies of this city space, which will be opened every day of the year from 10:00 from morning to 22:00 at night.
Variable shoes
It's about Christmas and you're never going to resume the star views to adapt them to our feast vestuary.
The form of the shock, very important to make silve, is one of the variables we need to take into account.
Here's a few suggestions.
The Fergie song elected an exhibitioned and very complicated scene. It is not very adsequent.
End and Barcelona, with electric car
The final electric company, together with the Barcellona Review, has created the LIVE Office.
It is a project to develop and promote electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logic for the installation of the Elecctric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the route sheet for the installation of the electric car in the city and will achieve agreements in turn to mobility, manage, coordinating, presenting subventions, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors concerned.
Finally, it is intended to encourage what will be the transport of the future.
3 'electic cidens'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla are subject to the project.
Three cities are elected by the Government within the MOVE Plan to encourage the installation of the electric vehicle.
The final electric company has already signed a framework agreement with the Cataluña General.
This is the aim of promoting technology research and development in the Catholic Autonomic Community.
The activities associated with energy would be found, particularly energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative to participate in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatter sees a "horizon of quiet" for the motor sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatter, views "a tranquility horizon" for the Spanish automobilistic industry, which recalled the main exporting sector of the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government concerned 2009, Zapater resumed the measures that the Executive Committee had undertaken during the biennium to support the vehicle sector.
"In the Automobility Competence Plan today, we would have a left panorama, closing some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks this plan and the provision of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of quiet for the future of this industry, which is our main exporting sector," added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Comprehensive Competitive Plan, including the Integrated Automobilization Plan (PIA), had been 800 million projects from 19 manufacturers and 137 aid companies, which mobilized a investment of more than 3.000 million euros.
The Chief of the Executive explained that this investment was both committed to the development of new models and to modernize existing products and processes.
Zapater also emphasized Government support measures to request, in addressing the 2000E Plan, in collaboration with autonom communities and self-mobilistic brands.
According to the President, this plan has allowed the average emissions of the new Spanish marketed new emissions and has proposed a feasible increase in matriculation, which increased "one 40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classical vehicles
The first edition of the International Climate Vehicle Room will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and the engine munt.
This initiative will be developed during 5-7 February 2010 in the Cristal Pabellion of the House of Madrid.
It is an exhibitional surface of 20,000 square metres where more than 200 national and international extents will be.
Not only you can find classic motorcycles and cars, but you can find articles of all kinds related to the engine world in Classic Auto Madrid.
So, between the packaging extents, you can find accessors, changes, components, textile accessories, complements, publications, miniatures, etc.
A hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic motor that will make the desires of collectors and curious collectors.
Entre the participating companies, among others, Mos and Good Old Times, sell car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of cars; or Cochera Clasics, Specialist Mercedes Benz.
External ability tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this Room will be completed with parallel activities: concentration, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and consequences.
It will also be performed tests of ability with classic motorcycles and motorcycles in a cycle enabled outside the ferry receipt.
Mazda3 i-top: Sustainable sports
Mazda wants to demonstrate that sports are not renewed with respect to the environment.
This is why it is completed to include the Mazda3 the stop and rear of the motor - designed as i-Stop-, a device that at least is available only with the 2.0 gasole engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of the Mazda3 highlights the good note reached throughout its whole.
The ends, the end of the vehicle, the location, the behaviour, the mechanical, the i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are superstitious in the new Mazda3.
Starting by the conductor position, we see that the front bottles are presenting an excellent geonomic and erection.
Furthermore, the taste of the flight is exquisite.
Following the joint formed by the tool table and the comfort as Mazda has continued the Japanese trend to create a futuristic internal design, with a large number of buttons and hands and calling colours in red and blue.
This style reminds us, partly, which also presents the Civic Honda.
So we can say that both the Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are contrary to the sovereignty of the German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to fight.
In continuing with the usual, this Japanese compact presents a room more than enough for four adults traveling with a high level of comfort.
To all this, a wide and regular painter is taken.
The automatic stoping and recording system of the motor, at least at the moment, is available only with the gasole engine of two litres and 150 horses and the manual change of six walks.
This engine is a real decline. Overall for its finance, by its reduced romanosity, for performances and to achieve content consumption.
And it is that even though the most requested Mazda3 will be the diamond versions, those who do not realise a high number of kilometres per year should not disappear this i-Stop with gasoline motor, both for their high travel comfort, as well as for their content.
As regards the level of equipation, the version selected for the test is the sports call, which includes a greater number of series elements.
Oversight series equivaling particularly the car change assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photo-sensible internal spectrum, boat engineer in a large-size screen screen, sensors of climbing, independent climatizing, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and Bluetooth audio and 17 pounds.
Furthermore, if it was little, this version contained the Premium Pack Pack, added by 1.500 euros: you will adjust BOSE and sound system with disco loader, among other elements.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts of the category.
It is particularly aware of the quality of the materials used, for their behaviour and for the high level of equipation.
Furthermore, those who do not get a lot of kilometres per year can opt for this i-Stop version only associated with the gasolie engine 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only unconvenient of this model is its high price, which is between 21.770 euros of the end of Luxury and 23.270 euros of the tested version - Sport-.
On the change of this high number, the Mazda3 will offer us every day large satisfactory doses every day.
"Premier" of the lower
L. A. covers the red sensuality alphabet of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie's hand.
The stars burned more than ever smoking in elegant models such as 'exys' in the street of 'Nine'. (Fotos: Gtresonline).
Our Pe, sophisticated as acostumbra, opted by a dark 'lady' lady.
FonPeek promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even viewing some type of attachments or navigation through the network.
He enjoyed his five-minute spama in the United States when the revised Time appointed him one of the products in the year.
To see him on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
On the difference of the smartphones, Peek has a very lower price and a very low monthly quota, less than half of what is paid, for example, by the iPhone data plan.
Seeing the success of the company has taken two new devices: one exclusively thought for Twitter, the other with a free life data service for change to pay six times more by Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday in the event Le Web, is the European invention version and its third incarnation.
It is equally limited as your American counterparty, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, from approximately 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Whoso travels with a smartphone already know what is to be renewed to the data when the border is crossed or an unexpectedly searching for a WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult your mail.
The idea of a fix price roaming is incrediblely attractive and it's time I'd have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience, there is a doctor in physical way to understand them and a good task to read the small letter.
The repeated ears of the European Commission's ears to achieve accessible roaming tariffs for all Europe have had an incredible effect.
Without the country of origin, it is afraid to use the data, and in reason.
That a apartment such as FonPeek (not let us find a curious result that Fon's name when there is no WiFi) allows this type of tariff to mean that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals that love their data network.
Child is another good example, including book download traffic and other Internet consultations.
No contracts and without gates.
It's a connected device and it is paid by buying it, not a month.
And that's what I hope to see some day with FonPeek, an option to buy with life access as Peek has already in the U.S...
Not because you're going to buy it.
I look at my mail in the phone, thank you.
I hope because I think it's a better model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's Featural Colour
The amarilla is, of course, the favorite tonn of the first American lady.
If you have already joined Barack Obama as President of the USU with a clothing and a clothing of this colour, you have chosen the same to join him, unfortunately, the second important moment of his life: the collected in Oslo of the Nobel Prime of the Peace.
Michelle Obama has brought a very similar model in the two occasions: as well as a similar colour - green sharp with light reflections-, the two times the face composed of three pieces - dressed, each and opening of the same teeth- and worshiped with a large bottle or collar.
That is so, that in a first view, it seemed that the first girl of the United States followed theast of the Princess of Asturias and had opposed to repeat vestaurium.
But the thread in which the two trays are connected makes them very different.
If to take the treaty property of a wheat box, Oslo is a tastelet with stamped.
The complements have also changed: green sappas from middle tacton again, and a similar model, but in dock, now.
And even different is the pearl: a collected in this time, melent the previous.
The 75 per cent of the workers' mothers have had workers for their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in the past years, especially for younger people in generations who want to be mothers.
This revealed the study “Fecundity and Trade of Women in Spain”, developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The investigation carried out between 9,737 women from 15 to 75 years did not have any doubt: 75 per cent of the mothers of employees have seen limited the opportunities in the labour field because of maternity.
The study has many differences in the beginning of conviction in couples and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the house, working in parttime, or have an unable work, starting before conviction in couple, adjusting the first maternity, and have more children.
In contrast, women with stability employment, mainly in the public sector, are detrimental in life and maternity, and have less descendance.
" Women from 35 to 49 years with fixed work have the first son of average, 3,7 years after starting the conviction, digits increased to 4,1 females with fixed jobs needed more time of their vital trajector to achieve them, which has brought them to put the union and the arrival of children.
Furthermore, the type of work played exercises a lot of influence on maternity, even though less on the packing calendar," the CSIC Margarita Delugator explains.
Student level is another of the factors that distinguished women's age when married and having the first vastago.
According to the survey, how large the education level is, the age of married and the first son is greater.
The difference also remains among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, which have elemental and higher studies have been mothers for first time at 25.1 and 32.1 average.
" Women's division is also established according to their level of studies.
While those who have elemental studies are married and have their first son before reaching a stabil work, the media or high levels invest this sequence and give priority to the obtaining of a stability as a condition for the marriage and the arrival of a child," Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth
The Oreal Paris has been taking a new name to its enlightened list of embarrassers: Diane Kruger.
Since the next year, the German actriz will become a image of different products from the brand, focusing on the universal lema of "for I worth it".
The protagonist of "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant attorneys of the international panorama, is one like other famous Foots of the Oreal Paris, such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Longoria and Spanish Penelope Penelope Cruz.
Before it, the latest in entering in such selected clubs were the Evangeline Lilly actrices ('Perdidos') and Free Pinto ('Slumdog Millennium').
In the male paragraph, the cosmetic mark also takes account of the luxury embracers: Patrick Dempsey ('Anatomy of Grey') and Matthew Fox (Evangelline partner in 'Perdados').
Premies of the British Moda
Britishs have a lot to say in the world of mode.
His highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - gathered together in the annual delivery of their premiums, held in London, in the Royal Court, you Justice.
Nobody fell on the citate.
The former Jerry Hall model and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Better Year Modelo.
Manuel Vicent poker
Manuel Vicent gives a murder poker (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) a thirty-three of writer radiographies which have passed through their literary life (and in cases, also for the other).
Don't do it in prevideble and fearful genders (biographical shadow, life and work), but seeking something similar to the Himself of creative person.
The trip has its excitements and Vicent does not enjoy sustainment or lightings.
Besides an exquisite pleasure, the book is a concoursive invitation to read and repairs.
There's some moments left them.
Sur Albert Camus: "I discovered on his pages that the Mediterraneo was not a sea, but a spiritual cleaning, almost physically, the same I felt without name: the pleasure against the destination asylum, moral without fault and unfairness without gods."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nehilist, alegary Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intelet, between impotence and ignorance, with a poety poetically burned humor, like the sheet of the kitchen that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband left depressed by this woman with a pasture that had been for thirteen years, in which the flesh conjuged the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of the domination, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching the sky through the destruction path."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand meters of the universal literature, which needs to square through the north wall, from which the best alpinists are disappeared again."
About William Faulkner: "It's a rare kind.
In itself, sometimes he said he was heritage of a condensed landscape, and others that he was a son of a black and cocodrile.
Both dreams were great."
On Louis-Ferdinand Celine: "This writer collected the cry from a punch by this person of Munich to bring his ecos to the foundation of the age of the XX century under his literary form and made it in a trip to flee from himself and calling to posterity with a violent speaking to the gusans."
On Dorothy Parker: "A day he was laid on roads and shot: 'God, I pray you to make me write as a woman.'
On Joseph Conrad: "On your tomb they were buried these sides of Spinser: 'The dream after the efforts, / after the weapon, the port, / the rest after the war,/ after the heart life, the death is pleasant.'
On Virginia Wolf: "In the balance also brought its depressions.
The husband accepted with all standards that she told her that Eduardo VII had shocked her between the pools or that the polars were sing in Greece.
It has never been given the case of a man so patient and loved a neutronic, whose literary talent would be before his loud."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What Benet tried but to pass Baroja by Faulkner's arms?
What did this, but turn the name of that man to serve him from his own feet?"
Cobard Action
The past week, my mother of about 70 years passed through our barrier in the Fuenlabrada municipality when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years passed together with her and our dog, an example of mixture race, rescued from the dream and with no more of six kilometres of weight and, without mediate word, made him two patches left to the hunter.
Our indignation is a massive because we have not found the difference in a free aggression to a small and unfair animal, which, in fact, was attacked.
To this, he must add the sofox that caused him to a lady who was quietly passing and that, when he had increased these individuals, he came to fear for his physical integrity, since a energy that attacks a animal is able to do this own with a woman, a child, an elderly or, finally, with any less weaker than he himself.
The success occurred at the five of the afternoon of a March every one by a traditionally quiet barrier.
The dog was weeping all the day.
In fact, we made a statement in a close commission that we believed he would serve for many and not generate sustainability, just explain that the murder cobards were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to declare this fact.
We don't understand that it is happening between young people to think that they are disappointed to a freely defended animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We don't know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together by the use of the box
The Michelin Foundation Foundation for Vial Security (Fesvial) manufacturer has carried out a campaign to promote the use of casco, mainly among younger motorists today, both entities.
This initiative seeks to be aware of the importance of use of the case, as it is the only protection element that can avoid lessons in the head or even death in the case of an accident while moved into the moocycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was part of its commitment with vital security, which "apart from designing and manufacture of more secure products every day" and confirmed that it also contributes to this goal through other pedagogical and informal actions.
This new packing campaign for use in the motorcycle, under the 'To be or not to be', will be a first stage in which the cards will be distributed in more than 500 motocycle workshops, with the goal of reaching the maximum distribution.
To finalize, Michelin stressed that vital security "es a constant concern" for the company, as it is a producer of nuts for two road vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop more secure products.
Under the sale of light trades
Similarly two years later, the light trade vehicles market begins to see something light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9.425 matriculated units in Spain represent a 12.6 per cent of 2008, and the most important, the first increase after 22 months later, according to the sponsory of Anfac producers and Ganvam vendors.
The good date, not obliging, should be put into quarantine since the reference to which the comparison was made - November 2008- was particularly bad, with a 60% decline on the previous year.
The consequence of this is that, despite the point of the last month, the matriculation assumed in these 11 months is 40% below the previous year.
Since January 95.853 units were sold up all the vehicles that compose the shock of light markets: results from turism, pick up, furgonees, light furgones and light chassies.
In addition, the nuberoners who more affect their demand have not been disappeared, although they are also acquired by individuals, most of the buys are carried out by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay almost 100 per cent of the cases through external financing.
Thus, the restrictions proposed by the locked grif of bank credits must be added to other factors such as growth at the point levels of paro or the continuity of the bad economic situation.
Before this panorama and, on the difference of tourisms, little support for the purchase of 2000E have been served.
In addition to individuals, self-names and pimmes that are going to acquire a slight market of up to 3,5 tonnes with an CO2 emission level that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been witnessed.
At the same time, from Ganvam again recalled the need for special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to industrials (camerages and buses).
Pronounced sales association a 2010 similar to the year end, which calculates a fall in sales (to tourisms and 4x4 of 19%).
Aid to emergency flood is already obligation
As the ABS anti-block and the ESP stability control systems will have to be a binding element in the European cars.
In fact, it is already in all light commercial tours and vehicles of new matriculation, while the rest is fixed a short-term period until February 2011.
The measures imposed by the European Union are aimed at enhance the protection of peaks, even though, in its way to work, can also help to avoid many colleagues by reach.
The assistant to the emergency wound is to increase pressure on franks in case of urgence, which the system detects by the conductor.
But this does not always keep this pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of components for the Bosch car, the third part of the drivers involved in an accident had not come to cut the crap before the university and half of them did not use all the force.
Hasting 1.100 accidents
In turn, the aid intervention requires the maximum of the fresh system, reducing the distance used by the car in detention.
According to the EU’s own study, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, they could be avoided until 1.100 mortal accidents in which peatons are involved.
The reduction will be still greater - if it is calculated that one of the four syntheses would be avoided with damage to persons -- when the calling intelligent systems of emergency fraud.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (on a radar or a camera) detects the obstacles and advises the driver, notably to act slightly on the pits.
If the conductor reacts, helps you increase the pressure on the peak, if necessary.
In the case that you do not respond, and although the initiative is inevitably, the device exercises the maximum effort to minimize damage.
General Motors passed until January the Opel Plan
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figuerueles (Zaragoza) have already been advised by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will be started in the first week of April 8, probably, according to Javier Ortega's information, the United States manufacturer warns that you will need more time to conclude the Opel's recovery plan.
What Nick Reilly considers, the new President of Europe, is that each of the plan's points has been previously consensued by the concerned party.
And this can make the final document that will be submited to the workers first and after the Governments of the countries in which manufacturings are, it is delayed until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, from GM is ensured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the next days.
This is not extraordinary that the Swedish Government has increased pressure on the United States manufacturer to take a decision as far before.
GM allows to contact some new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also encourages to buy Volvo, but has the option of the Dutch port car manufacturer Skyper, which is supported by the Russian Converg group.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some actives from Saab to the Baic Chinese.
The decision is kept to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold.
At the Porsche Boxster Spryder flight

Your behaviour can only be calculated of intellectable.
The reduction of weight does not mean that the car does not push the asfalt with aplom.

The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The stuff of the roads we went through with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car drew the baths well.
Electronic aids have not been attracted in all the tray, and that in some of the curves we found glass in the summer and seriously in the morning.
Finally, a ultra-level car, of the most divert to lead one can on the market and that it is something more than a simple change of Boxster S.

Furthermore, the great acquired from the parameter, with 16 notified triples had to see in the final trip.
The game began to face for the hurricans, which were put from the starting before in the marker.

Teletovic already began to be the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'mis' Splitter' valued already had been thinking that it wouldn't be the best night in Brazil.
But the game, although it was incarnated to the departure, was not much less decided, and the Macabeans wanted to remember the victorians that in his shoes did not win anybody, and with "the hand of Elija's."
Eidson and Pnini were decisively contributed to the 'amarillos' turning to the light (50-49).

The game shown in the first quarter allowed to dream the wounds. One aggressive defence and three consequent triples, two of the Omar Cook base and one of the Guillem Rubio, slighted the places 12-18, a minute 9.
The Olympiac was surprised by the intensity of the United Kingdom, even though the arsenal of the locals in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, gave him back to the marker 22-20, minutes 13, the time when a action, a piece accounted, between the two United States bases Beverley and Williams, overlooked the descallation of both players.

The Chairman should leave the diplomatic reading later on 27 January 2010, when it was officially concluded.

Thank you very much
After the wine and rozen days from the spring in which the inflation of assets has been the dominant tank on the markets, the uncertainness returns again to reaper in the markets, which must not be sure because it is their natural state, in an environment in which the agents take decisions on the future by incertain nature.
The medicine used by the Central Banks to stabilize markets was monetary of debt with direct purchase of actives and indirectly gives the free bar of liquid to next types of brain to buy financial entities active to disappear.
The Central Banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have been practically completed and, without concerning the liquidity policy, starts to earn something of swimming on the largests, as the ECB has done with its subsistent to the next week.
Thus, the investors are sure of the capacity of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without such erythrodox measures and are assisting a reduction of risk prices.
The birthdays of the Bolsas and the differences of corporate goods have returned, although they are still far from the standard levels reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been committed to socialism private risk and public debt returned to affected versa.
A new flight to quality and quality of the U.S., Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, provocating expanding the differences of the European Zone countries in terms of Germany.
As far as Spain had been affected by this inestabilities episode but in that came the standard & Poor's and brought a new revision to the low of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, something of uncertainty is not bad to raise the defenders of the moral risk that try again to create awareness officers on the responsible of the global economic policy because it has crashed the destructive effects resulting from the restriction of credit destruction on employment, when what it should be to describe a new day of thanks.
However, that of Dubai is a tribal fight between the emirs to recommend power in the emirates and Greece we have already seen it before.
A government that hides public deficit, elections and a new government that takes out.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sucrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
There is no sense that the Ecofin was saved to Hungary from an incompliance of its external payments at the beginning of the year and that it will allow a Member State of the euro to comply with its commitments.
What it has logical is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to make responsibilities to its citizens of the need of extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expected, we found before a standardization episode of transitional risk prices, after some excesses in Palestinian positions, would be inside it expected.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt are the same as the European corporate goods must not be worried about us.
If the European differences continue to be expanded, it would be the Spanish risk.
The standard & Poor's standard is an anequest. When our added indicators are obliged to most of studie services to anticipate their recovery scenarios for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which return to the load with a Japanese scenario for Spanish economy will not enhance much hope of life at their warning.
Again, it's all the painting that will be a excellent opportunity to buy Spanish actives, although at the moment "springness, friend of conductor".

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday before the Sub-Commission of the Deputy Congress in which it was discussed in the next two decades.
After his intervention, which followed the President of the Gas Natural-Fenosa Rafael Villaseca, Galan gave the press some paintics of what she had planned at the subcommission at the closed door.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest $50,000 to 2020 and more than 6 million between that date and 2030, unless nuclear centres are open now operating.
Not so, the necessary investments will not be of 6 million, but of up to 95.000 million.

Since 2020, the question changed and has to have to increase the power.
Its appeal focuses both on gas plants and carbons with carbon capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it is considered that there are 18.000 new new MWs, that is so, with other "soporting energy".
Galan, believed that the Sustainable Economic Law draft that the Government has concluded to adopt is online with what its company has come to call, not wanted to make blood with the real decret to encourage national carbon consumption, which is contrary to the climate change policies.
In his view, there is a "a long term approach" in this sense, despite the "pointal measures", as the President of Iberdrola described.
As far as it is, Galan considers that investment decisions, although they are long-term, must be taken as later and needs a stabil reimbursement framework to address them.

New tools to lose cars
In these days of time and accidents, not only win car workshops.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a sinister are relaxed to a workshop, where a loss must be assessed by suffering damage and what the rehabilitation cost will be.
No synthesis is equal, and the calculation of pieces costs and the work time may be a long and complex work.
Calculately the cost of a reparation of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including Yman work pieces, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with support of the most recent informal tools, it would be a decrease issue.
Therefore, almost 100% of the losses uses this type of systems.
Service providers and solutions for the evaluation of symptoms and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by the manufacturers, to then develop and provide them to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, the North American Group, is the leading sign; 80% of the values are made with its products.
The other signatures operating in the field of rateing and development of the sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is much easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, the commercial director of Audatex, in Spain work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in different formats.
Furthermore, the quantity of data to treat does not leave to increase, until the point that in the past five years have been lanced versions, the variants of gemotorisation than in the 15 previous years.
As a new car gets on the market, these companies are working.
It's a very hard work, because each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle must be cataloyed and put in its price.
Furthermore, a graphical "integrant" image is performed where you can "pink" different parts of tourism.
If it's a Vanmastic model, the work can be ready in a week if the process is very fast.
If it's a minory car, you can spend three or four months. Currently Audatex has full information about 99.2% of the cars that are marketed in Spain.
The most exclusive theme have information about Porsche, but not of Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
With regard to the mobile park, more than 99% are over.
In order to carry out the documentation and development of the databases, Audatex has eight-party centres in the world (Spain, France, Germany, U.S., Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in specific brands.
The national seat is in Alcobenda (Madrid).
There, more than 100 technicals (normally mechanical experts) are working simultaneously with three computer screens.
Auditx invested 90 million euros annually in developing these databases.
Each month included 2,5 million data, and customers are receiving updates every two days.
The development of this huge information stream allows these companies to give them different uses and provide various products.
The most frequent use is focused on reparation and maintenance, but there are also tools for debt management or calculation of the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that is informed about the value of the used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but yes in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to make an idea of the type of support that can provide professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard valuation solution for sinisters, intended for loss.
Including cars, motors and light or weight industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of pieces, including the refund time estimated by the manufacturer or painting baths.
This tool is paid according to the use, for each value.
The highest cost is 5,75 euros, for customers that use it little, a maximum of ten times per month.
After each company, which makes thousands of losses, enters your price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipation with which go out of the mount line only with their bastiage number.
HelpGlass focuses on the moon of the vehicles, and AudaSubastas is a open service for the vocational sector in the Internet which allows the total absolutely declared vehicles.
Your statistics service is very useful to identify trends, to perform geodemographical analysis or to know the disasters by homodelos marks.
For example, how many models of certain mark have been studied by the workshop because of warrants or how serious symptoms have been suffered during a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Commerciality, among others, Gt Evaluate, which is also intended for loss and also provides digital images, pieces or prices and official time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Unsa Group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and damaging solutions, car rental or maintenance
