What is it? The 周SSD in Prague does not know nor know Voldemort or pastelery
The new concejals of the μSSD in the capital will appear to be to overcome the clear language barriers in order to make the components of the Prague Board and the municipal Council into their renewed partners of the ODS.
The updated period.cz "examined" to the members of the new Council of 周SSD in order to verify its knowledge of the marked language which has been over the last years in the Council, when Prague ruled the current members of the coalition.
The encoded speaker used by the flower and political birth of Prague during the previous period of the Pavel Beem, including some of the individuals, situations and causes of the most known metropolis.
Surprisingly, new concejals have been tested that they are almost not understood these known concepts.
At least they say it.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"The truth is I don't know."
"I'm still a newspaper in practical policy," he confirmed during the review of "Colegue" the concept of culture Lukáš Kaoký.
And in respect of the political vessel, he reacted the same Karel B月ezina.
Maybe they know the concept "hoo of golf".
"It may be the only expression of all you asked me that you used once when."
"If not, normally not employment slang."
From the Glossary, whose definitions published the updated period in June before the ODS vote Congress, the redaction elected six examples, particularly those that are particularly related to the municipal authorities in Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "mayor today of Prague golf", "ir to the pastelery", "New tower", "tradition of the capital" and "blindar".
Three concejals accepted testing and a quarter, Antonin Weinert, who will be responsible for education in Prague, at the beginning, but did not recover the phone again.
The fifth concejal, Peter Dolínek, was directly refused to do it.
"I don't put it in these things and I don't think to appreciate how the democratic civilians divorce."
"Whatever I care is how we will understand in our implementation of our programs," she said.
As it has been seen, the concejal Lukáš Kakuý had not been taken into account that the previous title is a expression on an influent business and a friend of the exalcalde Bem, Roman Janoušek.
The word "Voldemort" does not say anything; the only term that has reached in the review is "the largest golf of Prague" today.
"It's the white tunel," said Kaukukius, which immediately adds: "But I know it better for news."
"I'll have to look at a language course," bromea.
Karel Bćezina is not the only one who recognizes the white tunnel today, but also the environment concejal Lukáš Plachý.
Afterward, both socio-democrates know who is actually Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý also knows where to find this person, and also suspects the meaning of "gain to the pastelery".
"I think it's saying to go to a Praga company; it's soon going to Plachý, which is the home of Janoušek's company.
In the same way, it indicates that such knowledge has obtained them from the news, but that it does not use such vocabulary.
According to the test participants, there is no so-democrat glossary such family in chocolate terms.
"I asked my fellows, but it really seems that we have nothing similar."
"Well, we use supports, sometimes abbreviations or do words games with names," said the President of the Praguish SSD, Peter Hulínský, whose partners of the game calls Hulda.
"In the college they called me B ה'aiza, but I don't know if my fellows also call me so," confesss her own support Karel B月ezina.
The newsletter update.cz tested the name and functioned.
For its party partners, Vinert is D月da (similar to "yayo") or, less amigable, Dćdek ("living"), the representative Miroslav Poche, who joined the false elections during the patrocination of the party, receives the support of "Igráček" ("playmobil") by some of its fellows.
The supports also are the only expressions that socio-democrats are tolerating in the conversation within the party.
A Hulínský does not like him to call Hulda, but the newspaper updated.cz discovered other supports for this practical president.
"The doctor of the Dog Rights" as it seems to remember Petr Hulínský obtained his doctor's right at the Bratislava police academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of the "borns" as published in a follet
Women considered as breasts in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
There are still an advanced age, for example, for health reasons, they are solitaire and have no children.
Women who are "while" breasts are sent to a island zone so that they don't perjudicate the rest of the people.
"The men are rarely suffering such but."
"Again, he is also healthy young women, because they assist in work and children," a currency explains that, in the capital of the West African State of Burkina Faso, is involved in a special residence of more than hundreds of women issued from their communities.
The local Government has decided to be opposed to this inusual " social media".
He delivered an informal folly that should contribute to the avoidance of the breasts.
However, this has a pig.
"Much of 70% of adults in Burkina Faso does not know read", advises the newspaper The Standard on the descentages of writing sensitivity.
The brugery accuses are also common in other African countries.
In Gana, the neighborhood of Burkina Faso, last week died Ammy Hemmah, 72 years old, when three women and two men tortured her, covered the gas and burned her.
The news appeared in the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to a disgracy of circumstances.
According to its version, the woman was taken into the oil used for ritual unions.
It was taken in calls when the group wanted to 'expulse the evil spirits' of the woman.
The isolation of the "brows" supports the people of all educational levels.
The Standard reported to a 42-year-old Burkina Faso: "The consumers of human souls always represented a danger," confirmed.
While in Burkina Faso, the Government tried to repair the breast chain, in Gambia, the President still participated in it last year.
"The President of Jammeh, after the death of his tea, launched a wide scene of the flocks that, at the same time, had been related to his death and had tried to kill his own President through the black magic."
"For helping you to chamans of the neighbour of Guinea, who, protected by police, military and the election of the Chairman, have been brought to the force of men and women chosen foreignly among the Guinea peoples to the property of the President in Kanilai," notes its report of the International Amnesty Organization.
At the end, the arrested persons had to drink a lot of herbs with alcoholic effects that also caused them intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive the stay in the finca.
After international pressure, they finally released around thousands of detained persons.
Bakala's inquiry: it is warming with carboons and signs a higher rental
The man, advanced and reception, crossed the doors of the centre of attention to the customer of the RPG Byty of the "carbon Magnate" Zdećek Bakala, the highest private owner of swimming pool in the Czech Republic.
At the bottom of the arm heared a few documents with the new contracts of store of three tracks: his daughter, and his son, which is complying with sentence.
At the three ends the liberalization of rentals.
Instead of 3.500 chec crowns per month, the son will pay from the next year 4.100 crowns for a pool of two stays with a second kitchen separated by the next year.
"Again, there is no warm water and heat is based on a strong fuel chain," shows the man's face in the new contract of his son, on which the sign has full powers.
"But I signed it," explains the middle infailed, the average resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which calmed the new provisions of rent as "incorrects and independent", recommends concerns not signing new contracts and waiting until the 7 December, date in which he will publish a guide with information on how to happen in these cases.
But before this, the man just makes a German.
"Whatever says something," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becomes a large laboratory of liberalization tests.
After the new year, most of the pools that, in the Czech Republic, were up to the moment under a regulated rental.
Therefore, upgrade.cz decided to visit the "werking" in person.
RPG's ministry waiting room is one of the four of Ostrava and, on Monday at the ninth, it was already full.
Just next to the doors are the security garders and the side of a machine to cut number.
"Alquiler 2011", can be read on a light button on your screen tank.
On clicking it, you're out of the machine a paper with a number.
It doesn't give time or read "157" and already the number appears on the large screen situated on the upper room.
In a second, you're in the kitchen.
A little later, it gets a pregnant marriage to ask, but the whole room's lot is not here for the new rentals.
Most people are going to solve normal problems, such as an anti-related: requests for arrangements, security issues and similar matters.
The letters with the new rental contracts will reach in Ostrava to most of the 44.000 pools of RPG around half November.
RPG Byty offers a increase in the rental between 15 and 38% in letters.
On 18 November, a special winner was opened in the customer's centre of attention for new rental.
"Let operating a week, so it's going to begin," they answer shortly the workers that are found in it when the customer is present as a journalist.
Liberalization and old tracks for Bakala miners are the most delicted topics in the area.
Before the elections, he has already treated the Vice-President of the Parliament, originating of Ostrava, Lubomír Zaoralaek, the 周SSD, and now they are continually appearing in the newspapers of the area.
"Vive years later I want a new ground."
"Don't change me the bad gold of the bath," the man mentioned in the introduction was disappeared.
According to the workers, there are no more than any jubiles to check if they receive a divorce in the rental if they sign at time, as you promise the special offer of RPG.
They will also receive the half of the rescue on February's rental for the remaining enquiries that confirm the new contract before 15 December.
However, the ventaillar of the "liberalization" is unfortunately uncertainly to disagree the avalanage of doubts.
"On of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, just asked for the rental in 2011 about 40 or 50 people," means the vendor employee.
While soon, RPG proposes on the web and on its tables to perform individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not arrive to a rental agreement, the question must be resolved by an independent judge.
"It is a threat, but information on the only way to proceed and completely in accordance with the law," advise RPG on its pages.
"There will not be judged by anybody," said one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man who is on the street front of the customer's attention centre, at least gives him the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and I remain 5.000 for food; I have no means to accuse the courts," says he.
But, immediately, the employed seems the duda.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralaek advises them in the means that they don't sign, so perhaps people hope."
The procurement regulation will leave the majority of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, in accordance with RPG Byty, its increase is an economic need.
"The current purchases are not yet covered nor even the quantities necessary for the maintenance of the Community's fund", reminds Pavel Klimeš, director of the resident card of the RPG Byty company, which adds that the disagreement status of the Community's fund that is, for the owners, the main reason to increase the rental.
While the five years passed between 2005 and 2010 RPG could be invested in apartments four million, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 the number will be increased to 5.200 million.
The big screen that cuts the teeth, in front of the seats of the waiting room, now repairs some data that are red.
"Increased rental increase in 2011 by 15% and less than 3.200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"And, it will always be a maximum of 7,50 chec knights per square meter" is indicated on the screen.
Thus only increased by 38% rental of 400 pieces of the RPG card.
"In such cases, it is an increase from extremely lower amounts of 19.66 crowns per square meter", indicates RPG.
In 2.600 pools, the rent will remain inchanged in the year coming.
RPG Byty promises that liberalization will not affect rental attacks, but that it will be square between four and eight years.
Furthermore, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money of the rental submission (see the graph) again in the tracks, mainly in warfare: new windows and heating.
They will have priority for those who sign the sub-convention agreement.
Architects understood that the offices also needed guarding
The Adriopoint Administrative building is the new seat of the Arch.Design company.
Nobody would tell that he's also hiding a small watch with all the same facilities: colour walls, creative movements, and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of the employees of Arch.Design can approve it.
The Architectónic projects company Arch.Design, from whose study came out many known buildings from Brno, thought from the first boats of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its ministry.
In the company, about 90 people, mostly in the age of the boom baby and they want to allow architects and delineants to come back to the work after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced time, the guard is one of the benefits offered by Arch.Design its workers within its social programme.
The constructors and architects in this way have the possibility of combining an requisite proof with the care of children.
The ministry was an idea of the own employees of Arch.Designu and, with the support of the direction, have achieved the funding of the European Union and of the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs.
The ministry of the company is financed through the European Social Fund within the operational programme for human and employment and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the granted funding (a donation of more than 2.8 million cheque crowns) could buy the equipation and, after two years, a qualified personal and services contract.
When you end financing (two years), the Arch.Design company has the obligation to maintain the ministry with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project was a year and in the presentation of the funding request, the Economy Rating company contributed.
Children's attention is in the hands of qualified staff, and the whole day they are present for their cares a sister and a professor of the Ministry of Education. It would currently be able to gather children without a limite of age, although most of them have less than three years.
Since it is a "mini garage", it can only be able to gather a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with the turns take more than in the day.
The functioning of the guard is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the guard, independently of herirries within the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the contents of the ministry programme are comparable to the ordinary preschool programme.
In it, children are not only playing, but also receive a quality teaching: From basic learning to the preparation for school, they learn to English.
The class does not only have table games and games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of little children in the own company create a pleasant and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of gathering the children of the college later when they are far from their work place.
Thus, parents are more productive while they work.
It is not surprised that this kind of nature is a relation to loyality between the employer and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design has been assigned among companies that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: support the family and finally this programme has strengthened staff marketing.
The house of the bones remains exciting after 100 years. Watch the inners of Gaudí
The teeth seems to be the lome of a prehistoric layer, the shoes remember the pillar of a dinosaury, and the balcones appear to the mouth of a open pez.
This is the House Batlló, in Barcelona, the Catholic architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of their similar form to a shelter, the locals helped her "the house of bones".
His organic forms, its calling colours, the new use of the stone, the flowers of blue and mosaics, a painting that remembers the smokes and all pressed lines, all this is typical of the section of Antoni Gaudí.
The port of the house plays with onyric lines, delicted colours and textures sacred from nature and fauna.
More attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thoughting order is observed.
At the night, all the explosion of the house seems even more impressive, as it is lighted so that the light of the colours is improved.
Serpentea and the tourism of the forms continues to surprise us also in its inside.
The wooded tree copys the frames of the windows, barns, the knifes of the doors, the guards and the letters.
The House Batlló, situated in the Eixample bar number 43 of the animated commercial road of Passeig de Grácia, surrounded from the removal of a house of 1877 from Emilio Sala Cortes architect.
The reconstruction was two years old and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich Josep Batlló, initially insisted to throw the previous building and start of brain, but soon accepted the idea of Gaudí to make a new and barried reconstruction.
However, the House Batlló, formed by various apartments, did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He cooperated in the design of Josep Mary Jujol architect.
In fact, on their plans of the project, the representative apartment of the property owner and the museums used in the peak.
In the plumb also workers of other creators and artists.
Cooperation in the proposals of the House Batlló was the beginning of the outstanding cooperation of Jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the House Mila and the Valell Park of Gaudí, where other pieces of the same are found.
Because of their organic form, the locals little after their finalization helped her "the house of the bones".
Others, because of the specific opening mechanism of the windows, began to call it "the house of the buses".
It is also said that, on the top of the building, the sword of San Jorge, Cataluña, appears.
Other cultural elements of the construction hide religious reasons.
Gaudi designed a unique system for the central heating time with ventilation respirators and typical chimenes.
It may result extraordinary of its quarantine and five degrees.
During the construction, Gaudí did not absolutely respect the building standards of the moment and had not been influenced by them.
However, the construction received the authorisation from the principle, although apparently the data indicated on the planned reconstruction was so vags that, two years later, after its finalization, the meeting had remained so impacted with the result he asked to be corrected.
For example, it was mounted that the construction included columns even until the public stage.
The arrangements were never done, rather opposite: just 15 days after the request of the meeting, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) allowed to rent the two highest tracks of the building.
The owner has been installed in the lower tracks.
In the second pool gallery, the room and the third bedrooms and the private part of the apartment were found.
The lower planet had a joy.
The house, from six pools, is completely transferred by a shot that leads to the terrace of the teeth.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all the correct corners and lines, cutting them from curve walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the rooms, and a larger group can be informed in this way without the privacy necessary for the most extreme conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, was not only obtained a new pile, but also an inusual teeth and two additional tracks.
It's also impressive how Gaudí play with light, white and blue black that cover the internal patience and tragluces.
The game with the two colours brings the maximum light in all the pools of the house.
It was just founded in the principle that white reflects more light than the dark colours, which attractively absorb the sun races.
Every person can visit the House Batlló, which was added in 2005 to the list of global heritage of the Unsco humanity.
On the first floor of the house is the spacious and reloaded apartment of public accessible.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, at the time of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous Creator.
The visits confirmed, or discovered that it was a very profitable business and expanded visits to the common area and the buhardilla, including the terrace of the teeth.
The price of the entry to the monument is not insignificant, 16.50 euros, although students, jubilates and tourism cards receive 20%.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entry of other buildings of Gaudí in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real environment of the bed with your lagarette tours, you should be friend of some neighborhood houses and visit him at home.
How you choose colom and somite: Women and men are looking for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for bed; what really trusts your quality to a good bed is the surface to touch, i.e., the colk and the sommer.
First of all, it should be complemented to the perfection to adapt specific users.
During the election, many elements are entered in game, including weight, height, health status and sex of the owner.
It is also important to be the inner type in which the colk and the sommer are seen.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend end chain that does not want to have heating, they should not be used the latex colks because they are "coaled" slower.
Furthermore, there are significantly more of the usual polyuretan colks.
Therefore, it is necessary to give them the most frequently.
If you don't have the center’s channels and, above, you're on a firm basis, you're staying within humidity. Even can appear moo below.
At the time of selecting a bed, they also affect the coasts.
Whoever has been a long time in the foreigner, often uses a very high colony with a blande and will have problems to feel well in a lower and harder surface.
"All of the hockey players who returned from the NHL wanted to sleep here not equally good."
"For their shots, balls and cadders, they needed colks with a viscoleastic ball."
"This type of colchones is also recommended for persons with diabetes that time of the nervous system, so that they receive bad information of the articles and hair," Sylva Hadczikov, specialised in the collected mobile.
Many of the hockey players, like other customers, take time to predict the viscoleastic colons.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these appropriate temperature and the Italian Magniflex, but also the tropical mark."
There is no need to be a NHL player to be able to appreciate viscosatic.
This "milligro" works in a very simple way.
We optimise its rigidness and form as the absorbed heat or adjusts its corporal warmth.
Nothing dos pressure; during the night, it will not give back as after a hard game.
Simplely, you're better to sleep.
Viscoleastics also works as protection against flages.
When choosing the size of the colon, adds its height, i.e. between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room of 90 cm, totally 180 cm.
In the case of individual rooms, for example, summers, it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
In order to make a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, a simple standard can be applied to calculate the width: by touching the mouth up, you should have the hands seen to the cods," advised Helena Prokopová engineer, teachers of Cechu clelounik to decorate, which has been already many years after the healthy dream problem and the identity of the mobile, the subject that teachs in specialized schools.
In double rooms, each needs its own sommer and colchon, so during the buying rooms you need to provide carefulness to combine the height of the colks.
In the contrary, the summits shall be needed to be accompanied to different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
The smoke collars should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the models with internal mulls are at least 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the table adapted to the forms and swimming.
"To touch it with the hand or to welcome in the colon, unfortunately, they shouldn't notice the mules," advise Helena Prokopová.
Each colon needs a determinated somner type.
The completely placed bedrooms, where the colk and the base are like smoke, have no sense in the bedroom.
Colks respirate badly and can't be washing their foundation, which is often done today.
And, since each night we spread between 0,2 and 0,75 l of sugar, it is clear that after about five or seven years the colk will start recalling us to a big (and congency) taiz.
For this reason, specialists reject the slaughters who speak of a life of the colony of up to 25 years or, even, of a life guarantee.
However, everything has a but.
Therefore, the vendors give a counsel: in the colks with an width of 120 or 140 cm, take carefully on the cleaning and washing of the fund, but better adds a colony protector that can easily be removed and laid.
Although they are currently manufactured colchons with crommellery clothes in all their perimeters, then when you open them remain in two sides ('I'm very important for washing and the size of the washing!), their manipulation in the larger size models (and by one person) when you lie up the colon may appear a slope between a musk weight and a weight.
In the bed, instead of a somner, you got a firm table?
Never!
As many for the beds thinking that one night visits.
However, it should be done (se you don't have) ventilation orives on the table and should be used with a colk with mulls inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with bottle meals (e.g. German Taschenfederkern) and a blend.
Poliuretan colcheons should not be used on such bases.
For non-comprehensible lamins somies and containing between 14 and 18 lamins, they can be used the use of latex or sandwich colks (e.g. a combination of coco latex and fiber fiber), although it is always better a summit with a greater number of lamins, 28 or more, in which the lamins of the lamb are strengthened and can be regularly rigided.
Manufacturing lamps should not be used with a mull colon, since it does not respond to the reaction.
Besides the adjustment of the rigidez of lamins, the protection of hot can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the lamins that allows pressure or, even, to draw the lamins so that "rode" perfectly to the dreams during the dream.
For men who have very wide waves, this is something very important.
Even they are remembered of colcheons manufacturers who, in the "masclens", began to use a more blue area exactly around the holes.
Women are also remembered, for which they put a more blue area on the sides.
For the most required customers, there are soumes with cross- or tablets with the called multi-modern amortiguation.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is relayed.
It should also be taken into account that, although you use the appropriate colon and somier, if you use a bad almohad (growd and "mulid"), the majority of the benefits will disappear.
The basic standard is simple: the almohad must support the head and the skins only can reach to the thumbs, so that the muscles of the same can be relaxed.
The appropriate size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
On the side, the almohada must be at the same level (when the somner is combined with reinforcement for holes or the brightest area of the colk) than the height of the thumb.
Modern colcheons have something to see, as seems, with the original colks full of paja.
Manufacturers are still using, more often, natural materials or at least mezclas.
In fact, the biological colony are moderate.
The primary materials based on petroleum, manufacturing the polyuretain smoke, are filled with natural oil, for example ricino or soja.
In fact, all known manufacturers are practically using soja.
"Biological, in the case of colchones, means that the center is only manufactured from natural origin materials," Peter Vašíček of the Tropico Plus company.
Natural substances are also used during the manufacture of the colcheons fund, one of the first true aloe.
But you can also be opted by microcáps, which release fresh aroma to forest or lavanda.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men are "refrigerated" with vegetables of briss, so that the foundation of the colchon affects heat and refreshes the body, women prefere "counting" the foundation.
Red painting extrait improves the movement of blood, so women feel more warm.
Do you like them now?
The coloms manufactured of fresh smoke, which are more porosous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes it more permutable than normal polyuretans and offer more accessible.
The combination of various fresh and viscoleastic rigides allows to manufacture colks of different areas that know perfectly where the head, the shapes and the talons are going.
A good quality colon will cost you from seven thousand crowns upper.
Those who play a therapeutical role are lower, as they are considered as healthy means.
The first benefit in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
The result is complicated to pursue in the colcheons and solars.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or sales can be approved, which at times offer two colchons by the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers colks Duofreeze with a scope with memory adhered to the foundation by 11.990 crowns.
The second is free.
It was viscoleastic with an open cell structure and a great density started with the "cosmic" material of Tempur.
It was initially surrounded as a material for NASA, because during the astronautical disappearances, it was seen subject to a huge overload.
The temperature stays with warmness and the fresh is hot.
Therefore, the human body, calculated, exercises a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to avoid locks to be produced, even though also to improve comfort during the dream.
The viscoleastic scene is used not only in the colchones, but also for health products, for example for almohads that are placed under pigs and alibians, as well as their movement.
The national manufacturers, for example, use the Eucatherm C scene or Twinsaver and similar.
Every time more parents use people monitoring devices to control their children
The fear of children always brings more people to think about controling them by GPS.
The system, firstly thought for the monitoring of vehicles, can also continue the movement of people and contribute, for example, in case of the disappearance of the girl of nine years Anička Janatkov.
At the moment the device has the nearly size of a cell box, but soon will be reduced to the size of a reed.
Many people feared the case of the disappeared Anička and started reporting about the available means to protect their children better.
Even costs to invade your privacy.
"We all attempt to tell us that it is not to play, but to reduce the possibility of tragedy," Peter Pilin of the Macro Weil company, one of the providers of monitoring devices in the Chemical market.
"I know that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example, if they are put on the bag of someone without his knowledge, but still have we not met with such cases."
"The majority of customers really buy it for security reasons," add Pilin.
In their view, children should always know why they serve the "cajita" and how they are used in emergency.
The child psychologist Dana Bočkov has warned you that, if the child don't want to take it, it's just gonna throw it.
"Including smaller children show great creativity at the time to lose certain things intentively if they want to avoid controling them."
"And, the parents were extremely confidence in the mobiles, but these were able to easily appreciate as the monitoring device," said Bočková.
In his view, it is possible to be discussed if this device is really useful.
"If it is an prepared secure, the author will practically always check if the child takes any type of electronic device that can discover its location."
"Now it's the phone."
"It is going to extend the use of monitoring devices, it will also seek them, since their sale will be done with a lot of publicity."
"In such cases, the offenders always get a step before the police," says the psychologist.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an unprovised attack of a pioneer.
According to RC Monitoring company, it offers monitoring services both for vehicles and for persons, even if the monitoring device is immediately destroyed, its presence can serve help.
"You can configure the device to regularly send the position after a certain period."
"If you suffer damage, at least the last position of the person concerned will facilitate."
"The most core devices are involved in an inclination media, so if the person is simply removed and remains immediate, the device will immediately emit announcement with the position concerned," said μech.
In your view, a service of this type can also be obtained with inteligent mobile phones with browsing, in which a special software should only be installed.
The problem of current monitoring units is that there are devices with similar size as a bracket box or smaller mobile phones.
So they can lose.
According to Macro Weil Pilin, therefore, the tests are currently performed with digital devices appearing.
"After, you will have the advantage added that a possible aggregator may not identify the device."
"O that I identify it after some time, what the police can take time," adds.
Although monitoring devices are leaving on the mount or colg, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle monitoring.
It is checking the position with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough meats like to roar all Chequia. But only two years are wearing.
The Checo Army bought 445 kilometres of mega to take explosives.
Over the past year, the Ministry of Defence added its arsenal 224 kilometers of meak.
So there are 225 years' existence.
The problem is that the useful life of the mecha is two years, four to summ it.
The army bought the mixture for explosives to the STV Group, as well as forty million crowns.
The General staff answered MF DNES by justifying the purchase of a so large amount of mixture, saying that soldiers need for training managers 60 kilometres per year.
According to the calculations of the military pirotechnics, with which MF DNES has been contacted, it is decided that, in that case, those managers should be performed with frequent use of explosives every year also all General, High Command Officers, including secretariats and cleaners.
They wouldn't want exemptions or the Minister of Defence Alexander Vandr and the Captain of Army Vlastimil Picek.
Only so it could be justified that the army costs sixty kilometres of mech.
This length applies to 25,000 explosions.
Although the army would be sufficient for more than ten years.
In the contrary, as the experts said, for the initial training of each new professional reaches a maximum of two metres of meat, the Army would have the new purchase (including the use of engineers or special units) sufficient for the 225 previously indicated.
The soldiers of the speeding intervention were personally rejected to the Minister Vandra because they say that they are still municipios for various weapons, so they are also limited borrow practices on money.
And we don't talk about the lack of internal clothes.
"I'm not even able to understand that we are repeatedly understanding such amounts of mix."
"But it's your decision, and they will certainly know why they're doing so."
"For us, the army is a good client that, as a company, we try to satisfy", admits the trade director of STV Group, Jan Dćcký.
The portrait of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of mixture kilometres, saying that there will be some of this "munition" as a minimum for ten years.
However, Jan Dćcký, from STV Group, indicates that the lake is so nice for four years and, in the case of the pirotechnic products for the army or the police, two years.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, you can continue to four," said one of the soldiers who, for the possible criticals of the army, will not give his name.
After the end of its useful life, every munition must be examined carefully to see whether it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, when buying meat, 445 kilometers had received a disappearance.
"We costed 60% less than the request of the past 244 km", says Pejšek's carrier of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual mix of the police pirotechnics that eliminate the munition of the Second World War or left by the Soviet Army, has no longer been over 1,500 metres ago.
Furthermore, the police always requests the right quantity as to disappear the munition before his useful life is completed.
They decided that for reasons of safety for pirotechnics and also as long as they can get more modern and reliable mesh.
The Ministry has already clear difficulties to end tens of thousands of tons of munition of the Varsovia epoca, when the Checoslovak army of two hundreds of people was prepared for a campaign in Rin.
According to the pirotechnics he said MF DNES, after a couple of years, the following problem with the current: it will need to remove hundreds of old mixture kilometres, which is now buying "bared".
To now I continue to live from the contacts I succeeded thanks to the concert
The fact of winning the "Empresident of the year" helped Lukáš Pytloun in the sale of its hotel's franquities.
The last edition, the "Empresident of the year" has won the 28-year-old Lukáš Pytloun of Liberec.
His success history seems to be taken from a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved him traveling.
Foreigners noted that in Liberec was lack of quality accommodation at a good price.
With the busers he met with foreign work and a bank credit buyed a house that was the average of five pools.
Bearing in mind that he was still studying her third year at university, he was really worthy.
"Actually, the relative quality price of accommodation in our area encouraged me to do something about this", says Lukáš Pytloun.
It began to rent the first track reconstructed to foreign workers.
All the income that had received investors again in the building, which gradually became a 54-room pension.
Since seven years in the business, he continued to open in Freeec four pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until a little time, the design hotel of four stars Pytloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
"We came to sign a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, which we sold our concept of franquity, and other people are interesting for a Pytloun franquity," said the company number one of the past year.
"In this sale of licenses for the opening of hotels helped the fact that we win the "Empresident of the year", adds Pitloun.
The victory increased its name and popularity in Liberec and around.
"The people recognized me on the street, still felt me often, and, I must say, it was very nice," remember.
Unfortunately, she recommends everyone who wants to try any company involved in the concours.
But it believes that it is not necessary to win, but that the participation is already profitable.
He states that, until now, it is still living from contacts and knowns that, without the concurrence, it might not have obtained.
"In some people I knew thanks to the concert, I started cooperating usually."
The name related to the success, in his opinion, included also in employees,
totally around seventy.
"I saw they show a more loyalty and are fiery to participate in something that has obtained general recognition."
"It's not, nor much less, my own personal success, but that's the result of the hard work of the whole team."
"It's my name that appears on the first plan," says Lukáš Pytloun today modestly.
My successor wants him a more quiet year than we had in Farmet.
Eufory for the victory was soon disappeared by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks for the hard work of the winner, it's possible that Farmet has been worse.
The owner of the Farmet company, Karel ◆árský, received the first premium in the last edition of the Vodafone Concours "Emppresa of the year", last year in the "Casa Slavery" of Prague.
The jury valued its efforts, with which he made a small technical workshop to ◆eská Skalice in a signing with an hundreds of business business.
"I can say that the prize not only encouraged me, but all my partners and improved our confidence to fight competition," said the winner of the past year.
The Farmet company's history begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed the father of Karel ◆ársk the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the property embargo during the communism, he did not doubt too much; he refused his position in the company where he worked and, with a pair of fellows, they funded the company with his pillar's father.
A little later, they began to specialize in vegetable oil prenses.
Eight years later, they became the most automatic prenses manufacturer in the centre of Europe.
A larger presence was also received between non-specialized publics after success in the communication media.
"Nor only our customers started considering Farmet's brand as considerably better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate cooperation with a company that has obtained a more success in their country," says Karel ◆árský.
The past year may not be in Farmet just a demonstration of the winning euforia.
It was also recognized by trade results until 2008 and partly from 2009.
And just 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
Critical emphasis, which had not yet reached many citizens, caused companies to detain its investment projects and began to limit the purchase of new machines or technology.
"We, obviously, aren't helping us from such a situation."
"The income was reduced by 40%, we had to limit the production and even had some disappearances", explains Karel 周arský.
A viable company must, in occasions, include little popular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the benefits of the company, although over lower levels than before the crisis.
Nevertheless, where Farmet had not overlooked expenditure was in research and development.
"In the subventions we have built a centre of research and training, strengthening the presence in the international market and obtained magnical values in national feeds," says ◆árský.
Everything indicates that the crisis have already left behind.
Income returns to increase and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to bring a feeling of victory, but in a more calm atmosphere," says Karel ◆árský.
A survey to disappear flexibility standards
The survey of Absurdez of the year is part of the four times of the business tournament.
It has already been resolved by the removal of certain regulations.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the investigation Survey of the year was the obligation to bring documents to which officials can access online.
The decision adopted more than one third of almost four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of social security requested an extract of the trade registration, although their officials can get it with two movements from the mouse.
Thanks to the investigation, this has changed.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the market registration when it has implemented a control of the taxes," stated the RESSSZ Jana Buraćová.
The objective of the Average Survey of the year is to consult the rules and regulations that must be respected by the enterprises and enterprises in Tsychia and to try to eliminate those absurd.
This year forms four times part of the business tour of the Hospodá publication newny and begins to create alike between the general public.
While the edition of the past year was reported to the participation of three thousand voters, this year has been practically reached four thousands.
And it is not surprised, since we still have several legal sovereign obligations that must just be respected to trade.
"What are the needed roles for the declaration of taxes that we are first worldwide?" Karel Havlíček composed of the Association of small and medium-sized enterprises and enterprises of the Czech Republic.
Since years, the simplification of business standards is a declarated goal of all governments.
However, in comparison with the rest of the world, the situation of particular improvement in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for a company, Chechia has seen in position 74a, i.e. eight worse places than the past year.
The Absurdez Concours of the year was held for the first time in 2006 and each year was recovered in the same way.
Everyone can indicate any administrative or burocratic absurds every year between April and the end of September, when the concours is closed.
The proposals can be made on the web page www.firmaroku.cz. later, the concert organizer chooses seven candidates for the "antipremio" and allows the public to vote on the Internet by www.firmaroku.cz/absured and www.ihned.cz.
Gives the absurd that you receive more votes.
For the investigation of this year, more than 100, in particular 105 rules and rules that have no sense were presented.
The examples were sent to them both businessers and professional partners and journalists.
Among the "financies" of the competition, for example, the requirement that the vehicles for maintenance of roads and autopses pay the feed or that the company with twentieth employees, two offices and two bathrooms each two years lays the walls.
The list of the seventy proposals of this year is published on the pages of the concurrent.
The announcement of the concert, which is always done at the beginning of November in the Wenceslao's place of Prague, is part of a event in which they are often involved political and social personalities in the world.
This year, for example, attended the act of the Ecu Svobodova, director of the Association of Small and medium-sized enterprises and Employers of the Republic of Tsjech Republic, or Petr Kućel, President of the Republic's Trade Chamber.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State is continually engaged in entrepreneurs, therefore my goal is to eliminate a thirty-year-old paragraphs that are currently unnecessaryly complicating trade," the Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek announced.
The efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not remained in water of removal.
In 2007, what was most harmful for people was the obligation of the company to communicate with a three-day transfer to the Office of the Permanent Functioning Area, the intention of acquire with a position to a ferry or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation undergoing in the second place of votes in 2007, i.e., communication to the Working Office by its foreign workers from work travels from up to 30 days, was issued in the law of the green calling card.
And the third will win the winner.
The Absurde 2009 was the regulation for the fisioterapeutas to have a great spectrum, a nice and two grounds.
Therefore, this year, the Ministry of Health sent a communication to say that he had deleted the obligation to have a niece.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
ecological, humanitarian, educational or deportal projects are valued.
The newspaper in this fifth edition of the Hospodá koncourse newské is the category called Empresa responsible in 2010.
The work of this concours is in supporting responsible and fair enterprises.
"Therefore we want to support the companys that are involved in the impact of their environmental activity and supporting socially responsible activities," said Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of the Vodafone company, organising and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebelde of the year.
For this new special subcategory of the edition of the Master Business of Vedafone in 2010, companies for which trade success is not the only long-term goal.
The history of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities would be completely between one and another, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In a case, it is for example persons with disabilities, in other cases of personal or health of employees.
Among the final quarters of the whole Republic, for example, the practical software company and Netera, which supports the training of informal sports teams between their workers, which then participate in tours of different sports.
Another example of the company responsible in the Pardubice Zone is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been seven years old as the main fund contribution to the sponsory of disappeared children.
In Podзbrad, there is a role that is particularly concerned about the health problems of their workers, as more than 70% of the plant; therefore, the title of Empress responsible for the Central Area of Chequia and the Vodafone Empresa was in the third part of the region.
In Olomouc, the MiRyz Soft accounting company gained the work time, even under the average of 35 hours, without reducing wages.
The title was also caused because they buy priorityly cheque manufacturers, support Community activities in the area and respect the environment.
"We intend to receive the most possible in order to make our production and administration the less possible impact in the environment", explains Miluše Ryznarová.
The TI licenseed company also believes in the health of its employees and, with each portfolio, offered them a hydromic style and keyboards; also supports the work from home and undertaking events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"Again, we support the beauty person in awesome, which helps specifically the local Roman community," works the representative of the Und月ej Business.
It will also be well placed with a mention of the Praní laundry company to čištćní of the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive special provisions in a special manner that repercuse their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transport, improvement of qualifications and ocio", says Josef Strapáč, from Bruntali Czasch's construction company, winner in the Moravia-Silsia region.
In the year ' s category responsible Empress was automatically designed to all regional finalists of the Vodafone Concours of the year ' s Enterprise, which responded to the questions of the registration form and sent it to the organizations before 15 August.
The organizations removed from the evaluation formulars that were not complete or erroneous.
"If the representatives of concurrent enterprises did not respond to questions, they couldn't be able to participate in the company's responsibilities of the year, but they are not disqualified from the " Principal" Vodafonne Empresa of the year."
"Individual candidates for this concours are not allowed, since it is a subcategorie of the main business concourses of the year," Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose advisory.
Police made arrests during a public subsaster in the Agricultural Fund, in Pilsen
The police against corruption made several arrests in the building of the Agricultural Fund in recent days.
Detectives were married to a local businessman in the media sector and the real estate company Luboš G.
It seems that it is trying to manipulate an existing public subsistence for the restitution of the rights so that the under-located ground would receive an appropriate interested.
I had to pay him for that to Luboš G. half a million crowns.
"On the moment I can only say that the police is looking for a sovereign person during a public subtainment and licensing", said Peru, the head of the general fiscal of Pilsen Antonie Eugene, adding that at the moment it can not provide more details on the current investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police led to the company in 46 years.
On the way it could affect the public subast, given a few official information, it can only be speculated.
The Lubomíra Agricultural Fund response to Pervo's questions, saying that the police has actually carried the arrest at the Pilsen office and was during a public substainment.
"It's a client, not one of our workers," said he.
The public subast is called "Convocation for the presentation of ground transfer proposals in accordance with the ground law" and is carried out when several stakeholders are concerned with regard to the offered field.
"They people, during the convocation, offer a higher value of their refund, which must be transferred before the ground's value is announced."
"In the regard of the offers, the order of the buyers is defined and then the Agricultural Fund transmit the field to the one offering the greatest offer" explained the shipment of the Fund.
Luboš G. had information on whom it was going to submit to the convocation and, as it was an interested person because he had obtained various refund rights, I proposed interested in the field which would not be involved in the sub-stake.
For this please, he was clothing a commission.
This would explain that at the time of the arrest, I had so much money over.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Foundation for many days.
She fixed the cause of the former Chief of the PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of delaying the ground replacement for which a construction decision has already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has been obtained from the Fund a number of areas planned for the construction of public infrastructures, particularly where a large route should be built in the Borská pole industry.
Afterward, he changed them very profitable with the judge by a house in the city's own historic centre with a very high value.
In this case, the advertisement had to intervene because, in the contrast, blocked fields would avoid the construction.
Familys must pay a number of additional expenditures of several hundreds of coronas per month
The households will have to pay from January not only for all the types of energy, but also for water and electricity, chauffage complements and, in some cases, greater rental.
The family will therefore have to get out of the card from January a few hundreds of coronas over the month now.
The electricity price increased by 4,6%, the gas around 2%, in some cities must be paid up to 10% by the supply of water and many increases the central heat rate.
The aircraft for families living in apartments should rise to some 100 crowns more than now.
However, the main suppliers of electricity reduced the prices because it has increased support for the production of renewable sources, particularly photovoltaic.
However, the gas is moderately enhanced, particularly when heat is used and therefore greater is consumer.
In this case, there should also be a couple of hundreds of coronas more than per year.
While electricity and gas are enriched throughout the country, the price change of the central heat would be from a place to another.
The price submission is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, Pardubice's houses or Hradec Králové will pay from January to the central heating over 50 crowns per month, while Libéec’s families will pay more than 1.000 additional crowns per year.
The residents in Prague should also support an increase in 9% of the water price and heat, especially in the case of the city to increase infrastructure rental.
If the rental wouldn't go, the practices will pay to 6.8% additional.
However, the prices in Prague will continue to be between the lowerest of the country.
In the north of Bohemia, where the current prices are between the highest, both rates will be acquired by 7.4%.
The purchase prices of 450,000 swimming pools in Prague can be significantly increased, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the CPI Byty company, which is located in Ussí Lamb around 2.500 pools, will increase rental from January to 100%.
The company shall bring the courts to which they are not agreed with the new rental.
Regular rental, which benefits to residents of about 300,000 pools, could increase the year coming to 10 per cent.
The young cheques are embarked with Fernet and R. The brain is no longer in the way, because it makes slowly effect
Ferret, ron, vodka, and even good whiskeys to his parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drunken cares of young drinkers with a age less than 15 years.
Children who end tomb in the hospital continued to overcome the rescue are no exception.
This results from the experience of the doctors with such cases in hospital admissions.
"Beber brass or wine is no longer of mode, because they are too late in embrying them."
"Now the mode is the strong alcohol drinks," says Peru, the Chief of the Hospital Hospital Hospital Hooovice in the centre of Bohemia, Lud月k Pelikan.
"When a bottle to his father of the alcaine can be whisky, but it is usually about Fernet and Vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of bearing up with the skin and that it doesn't hurt so much," explains.
It also confirms the motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinvá.
"Norway, it's just being treated by Ferrett or Rron."
"There are modern alcohol drinks, particularly among schools."
"In some cases, they use warrants that bound at home," add Jurinova.
According to Chief Pelikan, they are thirteen and fourteen years of drinking in hospitals.
Before Hooovice, where he worked since this year, he worked for a decade in the peatry in Motol, where the ambulance were taking to young people from the nearby areas.
"A girl had to get into four times."
"He has earned the twelve years when they brought it with 3,5 alcohol in blood, notably a mezcla with extasis," said the department's doctor on this case.
"It was in Holešovice's feast in some bathroom feast."
"The interesting is that his mother didn't surprise him that his daughter was disappearing 48 hours," the chief was surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents, or even its clear tolerance towards drinking by their children, which is considered the main cause of increased alcohol consumption among young people.
The experts pointed out that in the case of children, it cannot be spoken of own dependence.
"There is understood by alcohol to a person who has a chronic dependence of alcohol for several years, with all phenomenas associated with the same, which is not produced in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, the Chief Pelikan must be a systemly failed social or family environment," explains.
According to the Yuninova portfolio, this year in Motol’s petrol petrol clinic was hospitalized until midnight of November.
However, statistics only show those who have serious intoxication and have to stay in the hospital.
Youth beverages who, after ambulant medical recognition, go home with parents or police, do not understand.
Besides the cases in which children are just meeting school and drinking, Pelikean there are three state highways that can be mentioned: the burning day, the Year end and the end of the school course.
"In such circumstances, they drink for bad notes or otherwise celebrate the start of holidays."
"In the day of the bribes I came to see admissions to seven ears at the time," adds Pelikan.
Beverages passing the night in desintoxication under the supervision of doctors, paradogly, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible rescue at home.
Morning head pain, caused by dehydratation and lack of glucose, is avoided by the injection of a sugar with glucose and with the nutrients that are missing in the body.
"They take it much better, because after the busy night, they rise well, and nothing doubt them."
"Solo shown confuses about where they are", said Pelikan, adding that patients often suffer good humor at least when they see the expenditure they generated.
The ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a room for serious patients gets to cost a decade of thousands of coronas.
"I often used the cost as a means of education for them, when in the visit I say them directly to the children how long he has costed their embryo and should have to pass every summer in a work for young people to gain that night," add Pilikan.
The medical insurance may be re-retroactive, which is urged to return to people the costs of treatment, does not do it in the case of children drinking.
Two flights L-159 are found first in foreign hands in Spain
Two airports L-159 from a total of five, by which the Minister of Checo Defence replaced the Casa C-295M Airport, took the March to Sevilla, where the manufacturer of the House Airports - EADS is located.
It's the first time that a device of this guy is in hands of someone who doesn't be the cheque army.
At the time, they were only in the foreign to carry out practices or demonstration flights.
It is the biple version L-159T1, which had been using the Checo Army and was still in the way to fly.
The three remaining aircrafts are L-159 monoplace.
These are still stored in Vodochody Air and the sale intermediator, Omnipol company, already charged them last week.
Jan Peješk, from the Defence Defence Department, indicates that it is not yet known when the physical flights from Vodochody will be removed.
"The monoplace L-159 aircrafts were, however, separated from the repared aircraft before, without investments or additional contributions by the Ministry."
"The biplaces L-159T1 have changed in its current state," said Pervo Pejšek.
He added that the army is not without bi-place aircraft, since in May 2009 the army firmed a contract with Aer Vodochody for a total of 200 million crowns for the construction of four innecessary L-159 plates.
One of the new aircraft already received the army in July, the other will be delivered to the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS was committed to the aircraft to the equilibration of some other countries.
"The contract is clearly indicated that the EADS company is the removal of aircraft L-159 and will serve for OTAN countries' practices."
"Therefore, depends on the buyer to decide how to use them in this framework," says Pejšek.
The Hospodáćské newny published before time, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 by a Casa Airport and the purchase of three other aircrafts of 3.500 million crowns was approved last year by the Mirek Topolanek Government.
The Ministry of Defence did not call for a provision for the purchase and directly negotiated with EADS.
The current defence address claims that the exchange promotes future exports from L-159 to the foreign.
The Checo Army acquired 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so he wants to sell the rest.
Casa Airport may be able to have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has already announced the Ministry of Czech Defence at the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircrafts by conducting a European license and not contacting one manufacturer.
The army already received three home airports and the last should reach the Prague Airport from Kbely in fourteen days.
One longer index than the announces a more low risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the annuary are subject to a smaller risk of suffering prostat cancer.
This is the surprise conclusion of a mirror, which is published in a British magazine on cancer.
It could depend on the standard of textsterone, the mastery hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative threshold can be a simple test of the risk of prostat cancer, particularly for men with ages up to 60," indicated the co-autor of the Ros Ele, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research in Warwick University.
The thumb could therefore assist to determine what men should be undertaken to a test of perstat cancer, particularly if this characteristics is related to a genetic risk or other damage factors such as family health problems, as indicated in the Ele.
During the period 1994-2009, monitored a British homologus of over 1,500 patients with prostat cancer and simultaneously 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the identity of the right hand shorter than the annular.
They presented the same probability of suffering prostat cancer than 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer depth than the annual depth, this risk was reduced to 33 per cent; for men aged 60 per cent, the reduction has increased 87 per cent.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers concerned, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is expressed in the matrix.
A lower textsteron level matches a longer index.
The previous studies indicated that the textsteron affected the development of the prostat cancer.
The Great Checo and Old President of the Academy of Sciences, professor Václav Pačes, said ◆TK that he knows the study, but that it doesn't seem it that the relationship between the fingers' length and cancer can be "demonized."
The Czech Republic: D1 and D5 are closed
Chequia, as the majority of Europe, loved the twentieth covered snow.
The roads and roads are mainly covered by compact snow, and the quite machines moved the whole night by many areas.
Tomorrow, D5 was closed between 89 and 93 km directed to Rozvadov because of several accidents of industrial vehicles and tourism, like the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The news were transmitted to the operator of the Ust-delnío automotoklubu (UAMK).
In the middle of 91, two industrial vehicles caught in 93.
We also ended several towers in the kitchen.
There are also problems in the D1 car in the mile of 185 miles in Prague.
There were two trucks.
The drivers must move slowly after Brno in the km 190 or cross Brno and be included in the kilometre 182 in Kyovalce.
There have been agatics of several kilometres.
There was also an accident on the D11 road, just next to Prague.
Praga is covered by a snow scene of several centimeters and the terms indicate -7 oC.
They are forming agatics for example in Prose, even though it is also congeded ◆t rboholská.
The most secure transport is the meter.
Transcripts move with delay, for example, on the line between Karlovo Namsí and Nammastí Míru.
On the eighth morning, another crisis will be made in Prague.
The problems also affect railways and airports.
Because of the snow, the Checa railway company had an annual seven connections for three fast.
The problems, for example, affect the line between Praga and Kingupy or Praga and Beroun.
The travelers should check what the current situation is.
Ruzyn's airport was closed from the 11th night of Wednesday to the 5th morning.
Currently, it can already be circulated by the majority of the south of Moravia, but with extreme precaution.
In Vyškovska, three secondary roads are closed to circulation, in Brnínska are forming snow languages and in Blanenska are needed lines to access certain paths of access to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
To date the connections are closed: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also †aratice - Milešovice.
They will be requested for fressors.
At the moment you can't say when they'll be opened to the movement.
In Hondonska, a careful career is required in the area of the Karpaty Big (Blues Chapters).
The roads of the region which, as a result of a protected natural area, should only be left in an inatrious state, are approximately five centimeters of snow, as indicated by the μTK.
In Chekia, they caught between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in the north of Bohemia, where the neck scene reached 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silsia region, about 15 centimeters of snow.
Nevads are gradually moved to Chequia.
The American soldiers have a new "intelligent army"
The American army is using a new "integrant" army, known only by the XM-25 encoded name.
The generals hope that the new reef affects the local conflict with the Taliban and that "change the progress of the game" has been overcome.
New weapons are like a small gun and a extremely precise point.
Their balls are disappeared with a laser with a precise number of metres.
The special calibre munition of 25 mm created for this rifle and the high burden of explosives containing that actually operates as a small grant.
The projects can be programmed to operate not only when they hit the target but at any point that they are found in their Baltic trajector.
They can be used against the enemies that are hidden after an obscene, a wall or a triangle.
Unfortunately, normal protection cannot be used and, when launching the slaughter of metal acids, it may be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new fusil is the first weapon for childhood using an "intelligent".
"The soldiers manipulate the goal so that they find the goal, pointing their Laser race, which determines the distance, then gets a necessary view point and, as it is, corrects the project line and covers the title."
"Let's saying they've been measured 543 meters."
"When the wheel is knocked, the weapon is loaded and laid the projectil to a distance of 543 metres, less one, two or three metres," says Audette.
400 job posts are transferred
The Fujitsu consortium moves its sugar to Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the next year, 400 employees will change their work place of their previous offices in the Marienbader place in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortion of Fujitsu moves its sucursal to Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the Great of the specialized sector in computers and its maintenance, 400 men and women will be transferred in July of the next year of its previous offices in Marienbader place in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large complex of offices on the street Leoner Street in Niederrad, Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu portrait explained that in the middle of more 100 employees, which were previously dismissed by the region, there will be reached.
The offer is highly attractive, as well as the collective office in Astro Park will favour the way to work employees.
Furthermore, Fujitsu will be the only call in Bad Homburg.
The director Bernd Wagner confirmed that "in Franfkurt-Neederrad we found a central location with an excellent infrastructure."
The lighting connection with the airport is very important in today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new movement of an important company in the region caused yesterday joy between those who were in favour and disappearance.
Frankfurt economic head, Markus Frank (CDU) said that with this a "Global Player" has been won.
This is a "pleasant recognition to the location."
Fujitsu sits in the city, the accommodation is a great impuls for Niedrod.
The Bod Hombruger, Michael Corwisi (Green Lodes) is laughing for Fujitsu's decision.
The address had been informed before the city about its intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the company," Corwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of Marienbader place could not change difficulties.
At the end and at the end, economic reasons produced the fall.
So there is now a great empty place covering in the famous position.
"I hope the owner and the designer of the building are cooperative."
The immuble previously used by Fujitsu in the Councilplace and the neighbourhood "Kleine Verticale" formed part of the sovereign buildings of Marienbader place for ten years of a contravertised construction project of the town.
As a common project of the city and a private company of projects between the station and the accommodation is formed a new entry to the city, which is responsible for the massive building which had previously been used by the oaks as savings and at the level of buildings.
In 2001, the investors and marketing companies, the software manufacturer for booking systems, the Amadeus Start and then assembled Siemens with the Fujitsu Manufacturer house.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was bought by the real estate group of Frankfurt, Germane Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later returned to the Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu consortium, orange of Tokyo, is recognized as the third world's greatest TI provider.
It provides firms, for example, computers and servers, and also provides the necessary services.
The surcursal in Rhein-Main-Ge Off is one of the elders in Germany, in any way Funitsu accounts with more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Neederrad, the following filials will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name of TDS.
Therefore, 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park building.
The old complex of the twentieth years, its name alude in the square form, hotels among others at the central electrotechnic association and the electronic industry.
Amazon cancel the server - Amenas against Assange
The threat will be always more than Wikileaks.
The Amazon Internet Service provider has removed your server revelation platform.
It may be found behind political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Asange, the Wikileaks founder, seems to be arrested in England.
Wikileaks’ discovery platform is always the white of the critics, always stronger in the United States.
Internet-activists lost access to their previous American server and are currently looking for an Internet country in Europe.
The famous American Senator, Joe Lieberman, calls for other countries and companies to Wikileaks boicot.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, which is in the list of searched persons from Interpol, must stay in Britain, according to a article.
"Wikileaks issued from the Amazon server."
"Hard free in the country of freedom", the actives of the revelations reported by the Twitter message service in the Middle of the Middle (Local Time).
Soon before, the Amazon Internet company had removed your server Wikileaks documents.
Internetactivists had recurred in the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon Services Web to be able to do with the high numbers of access to documents.
In addition to Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: "Perfect, we will appoint our dollars to contract people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with the freedom of expression, "It would have to sell books."
Amazon stopped the use of your server by Wikileaks, after a Senator's employee Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, he informed the CNN chain according to a call to the Lieberman Office.
The Presidency of the Senate Council for Security of the country had threatened Amazon with Boicot, informed the British "Guardian".
"I wished Amazon to take these measures before, before the previous information publications classified by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Love also requested the platform to prohibite the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstery and unconsident of Wikileaks puts our national security and threatens life in the world," confirmed a communication of the independent senator.
"No company responsible, either American or foreign, must help Wikileaks with its service to extend robust material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, which is searched in Sweden by suspicion, is founded in the list of interpol searched people.
According to a article of the London journal "The Independent" of 39 years, Australia is detained in Great Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
Internetactivist has constantly calculated research in Sweden as a stage of his enemy.
The portrait of Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, confirmed in London that there were threats.
"It's even called on a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he was afraid for the security of Assange, he confirmed Hrafnsson.
Therefore, the location of the Wikileaks founder is still not revealed.
Hrafnsson was evidently reacted to the statements of North America.
In America, the former Register of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, confirmed that the responsibility of the revelations of Wikileaks must be judged by traition and being executed.
In Canada, he confirmed a consultant of the chief of the government Stephen Harper, clearly with irony, in the television, Assange should "assassined" and Obama might "use a drone."
A great dispute grows between the White House and Assange.
Robert Gibbs, the carrier of the American President Barack Obama, calfied by "related and absurd" that Assange has requested the discipline of the State Secretariat, if she is responsible for recently ordening diplomatics that are involved in the spiony tasks.
"I am not all sure why we should import the opinion of a type with a web page," said Gibbs.
"Our external policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than your website."
The American Government must demonstrate the effective protection of its databases in general.
Russell Travers, adjoint Director for Distribution of the National Centre against Terrorism, was appointed exclusively, announced the White House.
Therefore Travers is responsible to develop "the important structural reforms", which are necessary for the filtering of Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to specify the roads, as well as change the overall information about the government and protect it.
Furthermore, the American Government announced that for the security of dissidents and activeists, the publication of Wikileaks should be under danger.
"We did all the possible to contact us," confirmed the shipping of the Department of State, Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to help protect them if necessary."
The University of Heads
The Gelato University in Bolonia is prepared heavys in the best times of the year.
The basic course of three days for future heatings has the maximumfluence and visitors of the world.
Actually where's all the wheat coming?
From the helatry and the helatium.
The gelyar develops the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of the preparation of heats.
The wheat takes out with a scene the cream of the shower's jacket, extracts it on the boat and sells it.
To know this, there's no lack to go to Anzola of Emilia in the Bolivia province.
But whoever wants to know more about heats, you should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer was equipped with the heat university with the congelator in 2003, so that the crowd of the heat of its machines meets the ideal highs of all parts.
The basic course of three days for future heatings has the maximumfluence and visitors of the world.
There are also more special courses of more days about chocolate and practices in the Heladeria of the own house.
At these times of crisis, some dream with a new vocational road, others are swiming on their desires.
This time they are 40 participants from 19 countries from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
In Jacky, professor of this art of California, he likes the slow meat movement and in the future he wants to offer a European quality product in the land of industrial heat.
Anke, from Berlin, is a company adviser and wants to create something own in some years within an ensuring work.
Two young Egyptians dream with opening a heat in Cairo.
A man of Malta and another of Brazil wants to improve the quality of the heats of their bars, and a love of the Canadian house, Julia, comes because their children love the Italian heats.
The Luiano Ferrari teacher explains the ideal qualities of the perfect heat.
It is not only decisive to his good pleasure, but also its self-sensitiveness and its good consent.
Luciano does not forget his training or the cover of birth of the upper national house, mainly from the south of the country: "The Italian heat is just the best, and therefore every bottle has something Romantic."
The first step to the preparation seems easy.
Luciano ejects the basic ingredients: milk, nice, milk in powder, sugar and stabilizing in a large battery, which warms all with an electronic program up to 85 degrees, and at the moment it'll spend it up to four degrees.
Then opens the griff of the machine and gets a white-based base cream, the base for all kinds of milk ice.
At the sudden, the professor asks: Can the cream of heat only be developed with natural elements or without steeling?
How can you give some gains to experiment?
Luciano advises that they are disappeared from the trends of the epoca.
The one who speaks of heat "not only of natural ingredients", at the best used stabilisators, mostly a natural product, probably gym cure, fresh cure.
Of course you can be prepared skill without stabilizing, only needs to buy it a day, cut it in a bottle, and the customer will fall a wheat sound.
Some changes in the basic mass are allowed.
They're using aromas.
With regard to the skin of the heat, the teacher Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients who are bought in the fruit section or in the sweet of the supermercador.
Damn, there's powders and pasts.
"All providers will try to collate aromatized ingredients in their merchant."
"Again, they must experiment once."
It's already with sugar fruits and fresh fruits.
Or even with the heat grass of the white base mass, which with eggs will be returned a bitter cream and with powder as a basis for all possible placers of the chocolate.
Now the students of the course can use heaters.
Luciano leaves them to prepare four different types of vainilla heat, chocolate, mock and avellan, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less or less of vainilla or other natural ingredients.
They also make the same experience with the types of fruit yellow.
Better knowing is not necessarily depending on having more towels or more pure fruits.
It is not necessary that the ice of sweet grapes bears, if it contains more avillans.
The Working Group prepares the adorable wheat kiwi, which uses more fruits, less water and something less to stabilize.
First, a balanced mixture raises the sabo of the heat, says Luciano.
The elaboration of heat is a problem of artetics: Melocoton cleaning is used with a lot of sugar, the proportion of sugar of the basic receipt is needed.
For lemon heat, there is a extra share of sugar.
Luciano takes out a tool with which fixes the quantity of sugar of the fruit types (mediation of Uechsle winter in the uva wine).
Successfully the tables facilitate the account.
Working iron needs more than physical application, as previously.
Not only helps the tool for the automatic development of the basic mass.
There is also an instrument in which simultaneously fights the mixed heat mixture and falls into the temperature under the cereal.
Nevertheless, all the automatisation is gone out of the small past.
The Gustavo brass is mixed to himself and to his fellows from above with pure fruits, like if it was a huge mini printer without control.
"In all courses," the teacher Luciano said, "It's just a question of time that happens like this."
Inspectors in a complex situation
The European Food Safety Authority has been infilled into the industry experienced with transgenous plants.
Currently, this matter is the group of Testbiotech experts, which is considered an institution for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"For a conspiration theory but we didn't do it well", he confirmed Christph then, Chief of Testbiotech, the middle of Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the Efsa Expert Group on Genetically modified plants, and another expert of Efsa are also contracted for years ago in the Eli Association.
The consortios like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer will cost it.
Kuiper has significantly cooperated in the gender-change-control standards of the Efsa of genetically modified plants, which is in a clear interest conflict, critical then.
Efsa provisions are in paragraphs of the same terms with the documentation of the situation of Siei and follow the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
It's the second time that Testbiotech crises a clarification of interests.
So, a high race manager of Efsa was without support or time of transition to Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngent, and has changed its band with this.
A little time ago, also the Mediterranean Rundfunk (MDR) revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which carried out by the Environment Office and a clear EU Parliamentary.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any interest conflict.
All formal data, also some of the industry, when they are high and technically, are governed in a report.
The experts working in Efsa are not required to have any contact with the industry.
But they should expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits its work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is called itself as a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policy, among others for the assessment of the risk for biotechnology without Lobby's cart.
In this subject, independent experts, such as then, are critical that transgenous plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that genetically modified plants are not controled.
"We want to know what, for example, the genetically modified mass," he said.
Current practice consists of checking only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you are not looking for risks, how are you going to find?", ask, accused, then.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks the same way.
The scientific research from 1994 is the field of genetic engineering and currently worked at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, the industry always seeks more, in the United States and in Europe, to influence or disappear the critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists that are not influenced by consortions.
For businesses, critical studies are not generally published.
"Industry controls security research," He maintains Hilbeck.
The race of the stones
The Gsell has achieved some of the total, about 400 kilometres.
The Monday was before Stuttgart station, with the Tuba on the backs.
There were manifestations
Nevaba.
History is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to shoot a great throat of the north ala.
Stuttgart's land never returned to the same: thousands and thousands were demonstrated against s21, the suspension of millions in the station.
As I was precisely, the majority of the hair was hit shots.
Rotate in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a red red black stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is scultor in Ostfildern, has 43 years old.
A couple of trows has been secured.
"They are left stones."
"Don't disappear."
It's enthusiasm: "A bared and poor, simple and natural stone."
As he said once, the smoke of the cigarettes has gone down.
He still doesn't know what he's gonna do with the trows.
The stones have time.
Us Gsell also.
Stuttgart's stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former deployment of the French army munitions, where Manuel Rongen enriched his stone Stein-Reich.
The 44-year-old man acts with old stones.
He bought everything from the desolation in Stuttgart.
"It would have dishonored, harmed the grave or sent it to the bathroom," he said in his office, a wood case that once it was a guard box.
They hurt him and threatened, explaining, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers that he had bought the rest of the northern ala to the detrimental company.
He spoke to the enemies of 21S for several days.
And she explained them that I couldn't absolutely do anything for the decade.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing when the stones followed using.
One 200 S21's enemies took the mass of 80 kilometres, with a price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a memory but also with the hope of able to return him to a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trains.
Approximately half is still in the forest, the other time it was sold.
Building of gardens, landscape garden, projects.
They came from everywhere, and they took what they could be brought into the womb and above.
Stuttgart's stone of the impulse has been converted in "the wall" or in the delimitation of Kräuterbete.
"In fact this stone is nothing special", said Rongen.
"If it's not from the political component."
He comes to his everybody, has a tour for his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He was lawful, interrupted its studies, and later biology, interests the computers and finally work with stones.
And she's loved the stones.
Along with 4.000 tons of stone.
It transports its treasures throughout Germany.
He says that it's the largest trading of old stones in the country.
Fuck.
In the snow there are artistic stones of pearl swimming swimming.
"They were involved at Dresden Marienbrücke," explains.
Caliza alba, amarilla, calmed, enthusiasm.
"My desired stone."
The road crosss the forest.
Locate a mountain: Red Arenisca, a front troop from Karlsruhe station.
And it's still.
"Good travernine."
Old the mazis were in the tribe of the Stuttgart Neck Stadion.
For all parts in the snow, stones and stories, a bitter travernace of the police head of Stuttgart, Red Great of the Sankt Blasien Church, the hospital of Heilbronner.
What work, some efforts, what I suffer.
When Rongen thinks of how she had shot the stones before and moved them with a simple opening and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"I would be a scanner if something would be destroyed."
It has not been rich, in absolutely rich.
But today 14 people have to do with stone trafficking, as well as cantors, a skull, a hero, a vidrive and a garden have been installed up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," said the man who is responsible for use of the rest.
At a little time, you need to go to Colonia.
There's also stones to rescue.
Alongside large potential talents
Rear an active afluence in the buffet.
16 Students are driving around the paints, the tomate soup and the sweet.
The Braunschweig Technical University and Vokswagen Car manufacturer have invited a workshop to mechanical engineering and design students.
In a kind of concurrence of ideas, they need to talk about the future car with the workers of VW and also learn about peoples car.
Revaluing and on the same way, many companies, such as VW, are gathered in a body fight around the biggest privileged minds in collaboration with universities.
Their mission: to contract students with more talents of universities before they enter into the work market and be paid by others.
And as universities do not facilitate publications on the ability of their students, it is trying to attain the exceptional talents in practical projects and to catch them.
On the second day of project at Braunscheig's Technical University, the consortium gains talents.
A Madam of the Department of Personals divides bolds, gomites and folders with the VW logo.
Exact to young talents illusionates the practices and work for students and shows them their ways in the consortium.
Nico Seller of Braunschweig's Technical University brings the project with VW.
And benefits for both parties: "Students enter into contact with the industry and acquire experience."
"In the same time, VW can meet students, watch more closely to the interesting candidates and consider them as possible for future workers."
Some partnerships, says Shele, aren't a little common.
The news is that students are so directly wished.
"The main point was previously found in technical projects," said Shele.
The fight for fresh graduates is rising harder.
In many branches, enterprises can't be able to select their employees between a large group of applicants.
If they do not have to announce and, above all, to get a highly qualified work hand.
All students of engineering disciplinas are in an excellently negotiated situation.
According to the German Association of Ingenieros (VDI by its teams in German), there were 400,000 vacant engineers positions in October.
And, according to the VDI prognostics, this vacuum of engineers will grow further.
In the auditing and advice company, KPMG, Roman Dytta is responsible for talents.
It organizes costly contracting events, such as KPMG road, a modern yincan type in which participants need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send to eight researchers very promised to the U.S. the next year.
Furthermore, participants can observe KPMG filials and learn about the company.
The two election rounds should be decided.
Only the crym of many participants will go to the U.S.
Universities are always more striving in choosing and cleaning the potential of universities, according to Dytta.
"We want to remark the mass."
"The simple trajet for himself only would be short."
For the Dytta Dytto's notes are given results.
"We have a similar action in the last year with all participants."
" Some are close to their end, and they want to ask to work with us," says he.
Besides the direct approach in the campus, they are also on the ground, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, classical with their workfeatures.
"We try to get students in specialized feries."
"Source on Intersolar", says Sitha Sstebe, responsible for the Solar Technology manufacturer.
Bonner company has approximately 1.500 employees in Germany.
Sstebe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently on the company’s web page there are 35 vacant posts.
"It's very easy to fill the holiday posts."
"That's a long time and money," says he.
A shorter way is contact with university teachers.
Solarworld cooperates with several higher schools, for example, Freeberg University.
"The teachers advise that practices can be done with us or perform their tea.
There are no publication campaigns for solary specialists.
This is why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: personal environment, jerarchy plane and comforted communication.
"Otherwise a great consortium can't offer it," Stobe states, staff charged.
In the search for employment, money is no longer the most important.
Decisive factors are flexible work hours, children's assistance or good attractive opportunities.
According to a study of the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld highlights the 55 place between the 100 best workers in Germany.
The Institute develops an annual list of the best German employees.
In the case of the employee, it is satisfied with the work and the environment in the same and observes the previous conditions of employees.
The staff office also is waiting for extra points in its classification for its aspirators to work.
"I believe that the applicant is particularly fixed in the external classifications of a potential of employer", says.
Wolf Reiner Warler of the German Employer Branding Akademie advises companies who want a long-term strategy to gain a good name as employers.
Please advise your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to warler, especially, internal measures.
"The best way to be attractive as a employer passes by own employees," ensures.
In the sector's jergy is called Employer Branding internal, also promoting corporative identity within the own plant.
"A satisfactory employees are the best embarrassers."
When people are well and identified it with the company, they are directly encouraged to the employer by friends and knowns.
"It's like a game with pandilla," said Warler.
Obama holds new oil perforations
Since the cost of the United States of Florida to the Medical Golf has not appeared in these years any new oil perforation.
The Washington government made a contingent prohibition and made its previous plans in a way inadequate.
Before the Atlantic Coast also remain new perforations seen at the moment.
This announced the minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, the middle of the middle.
What caused this extreme prohibition, which at least will be lived in the next five years, is the explosion of the oil platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the disgrace that costed eleven workers and caused the greatest environmental catastrophe of the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new perforations in the western side of the Medical Golf under opposition and industry.
The parties would like to reduce the dependence of the U.S. of new petroleum supplies from the foreign.
Today, it has not been explained of whatever is the responsibility of the black sea in the golf.
In the centre of the critical, the British Energy Consortium is found, which is focused on millions of demands.
A Research Board of Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the minister of the Interior, lifted up the perforation moratory after the explosion.
Posterly, several requesting consultations submitted requests for new perforation attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to decline a new catastrophe using more hard controls and more strict security regulations.
Currently, the responsible control authority, which has been accused of corruption charges, has falled in decreased, has been reformed by race.
It shall notify parallelly that lucrative fiscal lakes will be closed for petroleum and gas consortios.
The industry publicly declares that the total extraction in the golf will be less thanks to a more stretch regulation until the date.
"The government's plans are the largest weight for the growth of the petroleum and gas industry," says the result of the current sound made by the BDO adviser company - before the prohibition of extraction of the mercle.
American Energey Alliance rejects insecurity in the sector: "No one knows what changes exactly with regulation."
Investment in new extraction projects will be prolonged soon in the decrease of growth.
Ogoniland is crashed
The water of the rivers is petroleum, flowing as a gasliner: thousands of green litres of crude litres drove the nature in Ogoniland Nigeria.
People live the robot, corruption and illicit petroleum trade.
Celestina Accpobari seems good.
"Don't blow you," the U.S. activeist calms the journalists: "Today you will pass enough painful before your eyes."
Nigerian of 37 years has made a photograph of kids in the water to the skin with the light of the lights reflected in turbulences on the surface: with the light of the water, the scene seems almost good.
It is not seen that on the surface flying waves of petroleum mixture.
Before here it was coged with kitchen, Esther Badom explains on the river's beach Bodo-Jetty.
While the flowing waters are totally dead.
Fifteen years ago, he turned into the formidable humedal a impressive amount of petroleum by a rotal tube.
The fish around the small city of Bodo had six hours to come to full fish waters: that, in the heart of the Niger disaster and located in Ogoniland, it is considered one of the most afflicted regions of the world.
On the way of the river recovery passing by manglares, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship engine renews a warm marron, who takes his hand into the water, will take some pieces of petroleum.
The races of the trees of manglares are elevated from the earth as dark races of race, tristely island the palms that choke and cut their palms.
In vanity they are looking for pilar bands, as if they were in humedal as always: As long as the outdoor barrage is stretched, a form of fantastic calm of a previous paradise with oil to gasoliner.
"What happens here is a ecological fight", says, hurt, Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger for health."
Proceed the Bible comparison.
The Ogoni destination area is a renewed battle field for years ago: There are more than 60 years ago the first European investigators, here was the first resistance in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here was to place its first factory the Shell consortio in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for the workers of the petroleum.
Today the return of the companies in Ogoniland is prohibited: While they bombed more than two million black gold barriers from all the dist region, three times more than Switzerland, with more than 5.000 extract sources and 7,000 kilometres of tuberries, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too insufficient for consortium.
Each two hundred metres of road platforms, such as water scultures, called "Backship Arbots" to the heads of the perforators.
They have up to 50 years, most present a total corrosion.
At each moment a headel falls, thinking Accpobari, then he mixes a constant petroleum corner in the water.
According to the values of experts, more than two thousands of litres in 50 years in the disaster ecosystem: Year later, the quantity of oil passed, such as in the ship of the "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea of Alaska, one of the greatest economic catastrophes of the history of humanity.
Whoever is responsible for the sustainable environment region will be led to it.
While the consortium of Shell and the organised robots of petroleo are responsible for over 90 percent of pollution, the ecologists look at the heads at breaking and tuberries with flights like the main causers.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mainly low security standards in the world, the conventional researchist Richard Steiner reproached the consortion in 2008: only tuberia defects indexes are "for more than in other places".
In a place, which seems forgeted from far, there appears a full pillar of petroleum under the free sky, surround figures of between the mangroves: they are black and covered with petroleum.
Among one of the many barriles, which sometimes are joined to the perforations, sometimes arbitraryly dispersed on the ground, burns a fire: a small illegal refineries.
In the barril, the petroleum is warming in the fire more hours, explaining Michael, the chief of the group.
First of all, the gasoline passes through tuberries in the drive, later the wine petroleum tube and finally swallows dial.
So, Michael and four employees produce daily to four diaster barriers of 300 litres: "We bring 34,000 naira," around 22 dollars.
Inhabitants of the disaster use the iron waste in one of the largest oil states of black Africa.
Nigeria only takes account of a single refineries.
With the absurd and bared price of the penalty dishwasher 40 euros center per litro Illegal calendors can offer even less: so they reduce the value of their primary material.
Produced from "the bunkers" who stripped the network of tuberries at Ogoniland: According to the experts, at this stage, at least 16 million litres of petroleum per day in the whole crime of Niger.
Only an insignificant part of the provisionally stored primary material is clearly illegally refined: organized criminal networks, which also include political and high military charges, keep the best part in algibis and sell it barried on the world's market.
Acpobari akpobari is of course academic to consider whether the environmental catastrophe must be more than the maintenance of the population or the flood way of production.
"If the oils wouldn't be as invasors and wouldn't have completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, no sabota, no robots, nor illegal repairs."
While the conditions of the ogons are destructed above the Shell to the point that only appears a decline of the consortion: "Whatever is better to present another nationality, such as China."
Michael is nervous.
"It's the time you disappear," said the Ölmann muscle.
"The soldiers can come in every minute."
If the special unit of the army cooks the illegal refinders, they are not threatened by arresting them, if not with a painful sovereign sovereignty.
The soldiers who come from the north also want, like all the Nigerians, to get out of the primary material.
"This condemned condemnation has made our country pieces fullly," said Akpobari.
Researchers detect dangerous factory in A380 motors
It seems that A380 has a great security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landscape, the investigators found a possible factory defect, which can produce "a catastrophic fall in the motor."
The Qantas aircraft wants to ask motor manufacturer.
The Qantas Airbus passengers who made an emergency landscape at the beginning of November had been more lucky than that can be imagined: Australian Air Safety authorities gave their research a great security problem in the motors of some A380 and warranted from a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated implications: In a managed connection, the ATSB authorities have been caused to cause fat or greeting fibres, in a Thursday's report.
This could have caused "a catastrophic fall in the motor."
This affected motors manufactured by Rolls-Royce with 20 aircrafts of the A380 serie.
Among those the Qantas-Airbus which had to perform a forced landscape on 4 November in Singapur.
Australian airline begins legally against the British turbines manufacturer.
He made a request in the Federal Court of Joey to make more legal measures against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, declared that his airline would claim compensation by the principle incident of November.
In the brand of the motor, they lost pieces and their wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of damage.
After the accident, up to 40 engines around the world have to be recruited.
Australian investigators announced that more security tests would be made to superjumbs paid with affected motors.
Security Recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, signed by Martin Dolan, ATSB.
The security problem has become sufficiently important as to inform all affected.
After the emergency aircraft of the Qantas device, the airline remained at its A380 flow in the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines remained approximately three of its first A380 times on the ground.
Airhansa recovered a A380 motor as precaution measure.
This double covered airport is the largest passenger airport in the world.
A Nevada throughout the country causes caos to traffic
Germany totally white: From one day for another has been naked in almost all the country.
In many streets king the caos, the trains and the aircraft fall.
At least three persons have lost life in trafficking accidents.
Germany winter: In almost all the country has reached heavy temperatures during Thursday night, which has disappeared the caos on traffic in many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a neck cap of 15 centimeters of spessor.
Trade is very limited in most autopistas and in many streets.
At the A7 height of Flensburg, the skins are continually operating, leaveing the new snow again and again, but it is not prepared.
Furthermore, strong wind races barn the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency in Germany (BSH) hopes living marine levels with water level 1,2 meters above its usual level at the Schleswig-Holstein coast of the Baltic Sea.
In Sajonia, the snow acumulation has caused considerable problems in autopistas and national roads.
According to the Meteomedia meteo services, the red alert in Switzerland is in fact the highest alert.
There are some 30 centimeters of snow cade and fresh winds and strong winds are charged to resolve it.
Many cars and cars were attracted there during the night.
In Sajonia, also, the police authorities noticed significant disorders on the streets.
In A2, the snow and wind planned the traffic and created atasks.
In Turkey, Nevads affected A4 and A9.
According to Germaner Bahn, great transfers are expected in Sajonia, Sajonia Antent, Turkey and the north of Baviera.
The snow on the road, the trees falled on the carriers or the destroyed chain and the angles are the main problems.
In Sajonia, Leipzig's inter-urban service is suspended in Soloemberg.
In Saafeld, Turkey had a ICE train to stop his trip to Munich.
Bombs and salvation service attended 165 passengers on the train with milk, food and drinking clothes.
The winds with the snow run the streets.
In the highest German airport, the snow winds caused a number of flights.
According to a carrier of the flight information center, some cancelations have already been declared in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, there are 40 flights from fraport.
The tanks are constantly operating.
However, there are few passengers vary in the airport, although there are 400 campaign beds prepared for them.
In many streets, the middle of the late already had many accidents.
In the late, a trip falled in a colocation with a train on a road cross in Ostholstein.
The machine suffered mild wounds.
In the nearby of Soloemberg, a similar accident occurred because of the black streets: there was also a train reached on a road cross because the vehicle was stolen.
The conductor lost life.
In the train four passengers, the Bayreuth relaxed to Soloemberg was blocked for this reason for the morning.
Moreover, a 30-year-old woman falled, after driving a ride with her car close to Aschaffenburg in a rescue road.
The meteologs have a good news: the snow will always be sweet and the kind of dust and so it will be smoothed in races.
But the wind will decline.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
There is no doubt that you will continue to make a lot of fresh, in some places up to 15 negative levels.
Godche Bank Search a buyer for your gentle towers
The German Bank wants to be separated from his symbol: According to a article, the financial institution seeks a buyer for its office tours at its Frankfurt site.
The ownership could be provided up to 500 million euros.
Recently Germanen Bank fixed his seat: the geometry tours were modernized in the bar of the Frankfurt banks, while bankers returned to their old job.
But now the financial consortion wants to be able to get out of the costs of renewation, and seeks a buyer for the two chapels, as the "Financial Times Times" based on a portfolio.
The portrait does not mention the reasons for the sale in the project.
"We're always checking if you're supposed to possess the properties or sell them and then return to the one of them," he confirmed.
This is why the largest credit institution in Germany returns to the company’s office after a short period of time.
The bank purchased geal tubes average in 2007 by 272 million euros from the investor of a house fund and then implemented the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would be a lot of money for the bank.
The experts in this area calculate the value of the remarked period as "Greentowers" in approximately 500 million euros.
If the renewed buildings are sold in a bank or an independent investor has not been discovered at present, the portrait confirmed.
Miles of lie by mixed miners
In New Zealand, more than 100,000 people thought in the buried miners, who were deceived after many explosions in a threat.
There are still no cautions found, since security measures remain precisely on the place of disgrace.
It was almost two weeks ago a intense explosion in the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 mines of age between 17 and 62 were buried in mine.
A song was introduced in the place of disgrace, but he discovered no survival sign.
Following the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosives, no saving team could lower through security reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts declined that there were no opportunities that the miners had survive.
The body could not be recovered until the date.
Family and friends now remember false persons with a memory act.
10,000 people have changed with the ridiculous sunlight in Greymouth in the southern Neozelands island.
Keep quiet for two minutes.
In the home of the buried miners, 29 tables were collapsed with the cases, lights and names of the miners.
There were also personal photographs and objects, under clothes and superf tables.
The bands went through average at the government buildings of the country.
New Zealand hoped that miners return to the surface "of the deepness of the land," said John Key, President of the Neozeland government, to the participants of the memory act.
"But never returned home."
The death of his son can't sow until he had not seen his body, he confirmed Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Join the President of the Government and the families of victims participated in the memoratory act of many foreign diplomatics.
In the first expansion on 19 November, mines were also buried from British and South African origin.
Rescue workers began to extract a fire inside the carbon mine in the southern island of New Zealand.
As explosive gases have been extraced, the abstract temperatures of the mine will start down, said Gary Knowles, the top of the police, the periodists.
The devil, the warrier!
Does the goe in the artistic kitchen?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn returned to investigate gender borders with its battle epey "Walhalla Rising".
In what public will the Danish Director Nikolas Winding Refn to the "Walhalla Rising"?
A viking warrior took with a only eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is freed from his torturers and murdered to his enemies with almost overhuman fights, it sounds ideal for young spectators who seek blooding action, exactly because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and harm their enemies the tribes of their body with life when he's a hurt.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is named in fact, does not say almost any word during all the film and other persons are left to bear a lot of one or two sentences or a couple of mortal crites.
On the other hand, they call and rejoice in the montuary and terrorism landscapes of Scozia, which the bastiers offer the world of viking about a thousand years ago.
More ideal for grown and interested films in the existence and very calmed camera movements.
When a movie has several groups of recipients is a pen that can't be discharged mutually.
The director Winding Refn considers his savings and trilogy on the traffic drug peining "Pusher" as a species of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but it is now refused to make its work to be for all publics with something more humor in the main course or something less brutality of the artist house.
A cerebral mass and a tripas brown can not dissociate most of the followers of the artistic film.
Most of the fans of the action are died of burning, if the Unio cooks a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent cristal missionaries for interpretative reasons, and a eternal calm and neck is still before his team comes to America and returns to sit there.
It's a bit that "Walhalla Rising" has not found cinematography distribution in Germany and only on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magic images, but also because, after the preuntuous and painted blood, a kid is hiding sometimes excitingly, which melts something of attention.
This film does not matter dialogues nor logical action, all is atmosphere, a febril dream transformed in film.
And why there's no escape for the spectators.
Ren is giving a moment of relaxation and its glacier images and the trance sound trance player makes you naked in his garage, especially the incredible hate, which from the hearts of the persons' hearts go to him.
Only a young rubber, which supports the Unity faithfully, keeps something as uncertain, all the others are possessed by the wrath.
Instead, the hero of one eye, whose reasons are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior coming from the infection for the enemies and for the provisional fellows, perhaps in the embarrassing of the same devil.
It represents loss, but perhaps only for those who are lost in every way.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mystery film that can be hated and wondered, to relax, change and surprise.
A experience.
Earth Misterious Movements
OIEA nuclear energy organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refused to consider this issue until controls are allowed.
On average night from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli battle aircraft F-15 I attacked a mysterious building in Syria.
It is located in the area of Eufrates; the highest and nearest city is 30 km of Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (OIEA), which is the reactor that the Syrians seemed to be built with the North Korean assistance in the Cuban, hidden in a river valley.
According to the United States International Intelligence Service of the CIA of the end April 2008, a corrigent reactor is designed under the name of the neighbourhoods of the Kibar is very appropriate for plutony production, which is built by nuclear weapons.
Instead, the technicians are still served for other purposes than for the 50-year-old.
The CIA showed a presentation on video with removal satellite images.
It was shown with an animation by computer where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the northern model of the Yongbyon nuclear centre.
They also taught photographs that showed the building from the nearby or from the inner.
It was a little time when the reactor was working, says, but he was not yet equiped with fuel bars.
Today, three years later of the bombarded bombery, it's probably more known than then, the enigmates have been made greater with time.
The former President of the United States, George W. Bush, recently developed in his memories before the CIA attack, was completely sure that Syrians had built a reactor in the Kibar, but notably seen indigenous that in the country there was a "programm of Nuclear Weapons".
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be more prudent and only speak of a "profit reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation.
They lack strong tests, as well as OIEA.
When he asked the sure that he was in front of a reactor, a high diplomatic of the UN response in summer as a stoned way the OIEA has "profit material to have questions".
The Syrians were shocked with much speed from the colleagues of the present "inutilized military building" and reached the ground to awareness.
However, in June 2008, a OIEA team under the command of the former inspector of Olli Heinoen found uranium wheels in el-Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite images on a Member State, commercial vendors at the same time after the attack, which must have a greater information value than the CIA.
However, these photographs did not get to the market because a unknown client, perhaps Israel, had bought them exclusively.
Therefore, OIEA cannot verify its independent authenticity.
Syria always understood that it had never been a secret nuclear programme or any reactor.
The uranium processed from Israeli weapons, explained Damascus.
OIEA rejected it as unverosimil after the analysis of the parts.
From then on, Damascus is refused to discuss the matter, as regards satellite images.
In addition, controllers are prohibited a second inspection in the Kibar and the entry to the damage of the bombarded building.
Israel also looks for a extreme silence.
"We will never come it," Ehud Olmert, first minister in function at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not provided results since June 2008 and "reformed progressively to a serious problem of credibility for the authorities," as a western high-deployment diplomatic corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, finally a serious crime against the treaty of non-proliferation of atomic weapons, which sees the OIEA.
OIEA considers three teams more than the key for progress in the slavery, which must be "in functional connection" with the present reactor, and others as these still exist.
Inspectors have not been publicly known until the time of which teams are treated, nor what function they have, nor if they look suspected.
According to the SouthDeutschen Zeitung, OIEA has designed as an internal Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskanariah, as well as the nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and placed a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which most likely belongs to one of the suspect objects.
It may be found in or immediately on the side of a military basis, Syria protects the entry of the three places to the IAEA.
In Vienna, Syrians fear a register which the United States have requested the OIEA to play military plants.
Nuclear Detectives were warning the teams thanks to the warnings of the secret service of the United States.
With satellite photographs, OIEA has an indication that material is transferred between the three places and the cube to the Eufrates' orange.
A Western diplomat with high charge in Vienna confirmed that at least one of the equipment can be "related with the fuel production".
But there is no "indication of sensitive activities" or uranium-reconditioning or processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is equipped with uranium that is not rich.
From where the uranium and where the plutony should be separated afterward for bombs, for these central questions, there are, in best cases, pleasant accommodations.
There are no doubts about whether the destructions, the valleys that can be recovered are found in the three places.
As disappeared the hundreds of loading of the ground trains, nobody has information on where the shoes remain.
The OIAE is incredible to the salt mine of al-Tibni, located in a few kilometers from the Kibar to the other part of the Euprates, which Syrians recognized as an area for radioactive residues in 1998.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA's inspector, reported her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the pre-visual Jane's Intelligence Review.
But photographs from the order show that the Syrians performed land movements in the three suspected places and removed large containers after OIEA requested entry.
It may be casuality but only contributes to dissolution.
In addition, the diplomatic sector said that the OIEA has used a few months to develop an inspection plan there, which Syrians would allow, to maintain the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the dimension of the interest of the inspectors.
In addition, Damascus is also critical to this proposal.
Western diplomatics in Vienna have been calmed a year ago that the reactor had already been destroyed, therefore the matter has no much urgency, since a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a type of embarrassing of the United States's exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the OIEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of " a option to which I am open in the future," but still empty.
This road is very excited: the majority of the OIEA Governance Council is needed, and some of the 35 countries there are not precisely worried about a scale.
On the other hand, as she reflected a diplomatic: "And what happens if at last they don't find anything?"
Love in war times
There are problems since Angela Jolie started a summer with the direction of your defence still without name.
She himself wrote the guide, a story of love between a boss and a serbe.
You don't know much more about it, but it's enough for aggression.
The rumour is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, loved her Serbian violation during the Iugoslavia war.
Bosnia Women's associations quickly protested, with which at the last time a few moving days were planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been rolled in Hungary and posproduction, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women's Organization of Force victims wrote to the High Commissioner of the United Nations, UNHCR, Jolie and requested a meeting with the actriz, informed a boss journal, Jolie is the embajador of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
It's not diplomatic, the women offered a meeting in Hungary that rejected him.
The meeting had place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
There are no stories of love in the fields of violation, and Jolie’s position on the victims sufficiently on the lead.
His organization, in accordance with the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Refugees, recommended to establish Jolie as a sponsor, report Guardian.
But what exactly wrote Jolie for the scenes?
The minister of Bosnia culture reading the guilty, entrusted after a pit and dismissed a permit of recording in Sarajevo, is not all clear why Jolie wasn't despite all.
The young person reiterates that he does not pursue political purposes with its film, with much efforts in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of war and to vote all the parties concerned.
Its content remains inaccessible.
A second symptom of the film that sounds quite different: the lovers were together before the beginning of the war and returned to find her when she, a musulman forest, is deported to a serbia field in which he worked as watch.
What sees considerably different is the variation "Vive of violation is loved by torturer."
It's sure Jolie's film begins really before war.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is "injust and based on erroneous information".
Currently, you can reach peace with Hollywood hackers: while the guilty continues in the illegal network, such as many others previously.
Nothing as far from here
This afternoon will return to be good for the Irelands.
No race of disappearance
Instead, the household team on its customers in Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans cried with joy while the high music relaxed, smile the ground with the feet.
The Bailey club lives in the Swiss Cork, because the players are launched, and find, pingpong hairs from a distance of three metres.
The spectacle is called "Beerpong", and the premium for the winner is 500 euros for aircraft to Las Vegas for the world Beerpong campaign in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type, this straffal game and the computer discretion actually do not good mix.
And the girl of 26 years trys to divorce with this, differ from the flaminant question, what will the future deal.
The variety in Las Vegas is not in its plans, in January will perform a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad presention," he said.
"It's very far from home and I have no job there."
At least: Her bride waits for him in Auckland, "of a dream made his dreams as a manager of events, perhaps a good sign," said the young and dreams.
Because of the bad perspectives in the house, two of the three brothers of Tanners have already been looking for luck in the foreigner.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Jesusey, her brother Colin is currently working as a TI adviser in London.
Young people go: In the island there are many families such as the Tanners.
100,000 Irelands will leave the country in close future, pronounce economic experts and social research institutions of Dublín.
Until 2015, 200,000 migrants have been accounted.
A large loss for this small country with only 4,5 million inhabitants.
The prognostics are confirmed, a migratory area comparable to which island suffered in the eightenth years.
After a decade of progress that brought great welfare to the Irish, it is currently extracting melancolia.
The economic crisis confrontes mostly young, Irelands well formed, for which all is upward.
Employment loss and social decline appeared absurd in the years of wood.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three of each ten men and women less than thirty years are in the paro.
In Irish Times there are letters to the Mask Director of youth migrants, who want to say "In Ireland everything falls."
"I should have a resurrection against political and bankers, but who can, is going and ask our country and then to a whole generation."
"The last closed the door."
Leanne Caulfield, law student and President of the Irish students union is a sovereign future because the government is only dedicated to mountains and has no future perspectives for young people.
"Reduce minimum wages, but they do not have strategies to achieve new job posts," says the girl of 20 years.
He notes as his fellows of a practice not renumbered to the following.
His greatest concern, explain, it is to have migration in four years.
"This idea is triste and depressive."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this positive topic.
McLarnon organizes the "AbroadExpo", a ferry that offers a service on the topic to work in the foreigner.
"For those who start to work, to do in the foreign is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your road," said the manager.
On your website, there are photos of a boy practicing superf in Australia and another practical snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: Working in the foreigner is not as to do in the galleries, unless it congratulates freedom and diversity.
Since half years ago, Sean O'Donovan knows how it is to build something on another site.
Since there was no thing to do for the 29-year engineer, currently working with 15 Irish partners in the construction in Germany.
Now you're up a set of modes in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees only sometimes because it works extra hours to be able to pay a credit for your house in Ireland.
"The situation is a little lone", says, "because it's long time of the first time that the shadow of his house has stopped.
"I have money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I'm never so good."
Something is confused and goes through heated rooms.
The small house is in a elegant residence area with garden care for the houses, in the entrance, there are large and cheap cars.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago 380,000 euros, 100 per cent funded by a credit.
"It was a very easy money without many questions," said he.
You're afraid to break up with the credit?
O'Donovan thinks a time, serves more warm tea and says, "I have no children to have to eat and I'm young; if everything is bad, I can start from the brain."
The civil engineer doesn't like the complaints that often hear today.
"No one must pass hunger, our situation is not, with a lot of difference, both dramatic, as well as in past times here in the island," says he.
"To work a time in the foreigner is not worse than it can happen, perhaps we feel at first as Ireland."
He felt and seemed to his father, that in the last large economic crisis, he went to England.
"After seven years, life continued in Ireland, very simple."
The Chian Tanner likes these ideas.
Stop the future and simply see how life is on the other side.
He already worked a couple of years in London, and why would he not go well to him and his girl in New Zealand?
But in these days there is something that is worried about surrounding: the celebration of his 27th Saturday in Dublín.
I'm afraid you can generate in a dismissed feast.
"Otherwise, don't have emotions," says he and gives a big trago to his brain.
"Defait, sounds very angustistic."
"We better call you a party to go, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
Democratic rutin
Democracy continues to enhance and support private enterprises.
Crime produces more concern than unemployment.
Furthermore, most of the region is Brazil as an influent country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the last investigation of the Latinobarometer in 18 countries and were exclusively published by The Economist.
Since the investigation has been regularly held since 1995, it allows the monitoring of action changes in the region.
In the results of the investigation of this year, held in September and the principles of October, there are two related issues.
The first is the relatively animated humor in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of the attitudes to democracy and its main institutions.
Democracy support has significantly increased in different countries of the coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, where economic growth has reached a average of 6% annually since 2002, democracy support has increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also grown in Mexico, where the economy was recovered after suffering a huge decline of production last year.
However, only half of the meetings in Mexico and Brazil, the two populary countries in the area are agreed democrates, which down the regional average (see graph 2).
The 44% of the surveys in the region had been satisfied with the way democracy operating in its country, the same number as the past year, but considerably more than 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (graph 3).
The 34 per cent stated that they trusted the Congress of its country and 45 per cent in its Government, the same amount as the past year, but considerably above 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
Economic turbulences in Latin America seriously affected democracy support.
The fact that it has been kept during the global financial crisis is probably that many Latin American countries have only been affected by a short recession and have enjoyed strong recovery.
Furthermore, the existence of a stronger social network has contributed to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the percentage of Latin Americans that live in the marginally poverty in 2009 and that this year has been reduced to 32 per cent.)
However, the state of mind would significantly be from a country to another (see graph 4).
The good economic performances of Brazil and the popularity of his ruling President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a general feeling of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and has increased violent crimes.
Secondly, since the investigations started, the most investigated in Latin America mention the crime, instead of unemployment, as the most serious problem of its country (see graph 5).
A 31 per cent claims that either they or a neighborhood has been victim of crime in the past year, a number which has been reduced from 38 per cent of the past year and that it is the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
The most positive economic performance is reflected in more support for private enterprises and market economy: around 71 per cent of those in the region states that private enterprises are essential for development, while only 56 per cent was in 2007 (see graph 6).
A 58% recalls that the market economy is the only system that will allow its country to be developed, over 47% in the past year.
It is interesting that 62 per cent of the surveys in Venezuela consider the same (and 80 per cent supported private enterprises), even though his leader President, Hugo Chávez, is expressing many private enterprises.
Brazil is the country who exercises a greater leadership in the region, as indicates 19 per cent of the surveys (from 18 per cent of the past year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, the same number as the last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent before 11 per cent ago).
However, the United States is the most influenced country in Mexico and the largest part of Central America, while Venezuela observes such title in Ecuador, Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to the bathroom
No one was expected that the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti were perfect.
However, they have been very worse than those foreigners who tried to help the country to remont after their problems.
Some people voted several times, papers ticked in the alcantors, destructed electoral colleges and acts of intimidation.
The electoral colleagues opened with a time of delay.
The numbers of Haitian, including groups transferred by the earthquake of January, were going through the area attempting to discover where they had to vote.
Some of them finally were given for victory.
One tenth of candidates to the presidency, including several of the most popular, declared fraude and requested anulation of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, were extended throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the United Nations officer of greater rango in Haiti, declared that "relatedly good elections in many senses."
The observers of the United States and the Caribbean Community stated that "not believe that these irregularities, for seriously improving the process, were necessarily invalid."
In other words, the spectrum continues.
The electoral authority, according to its constraints, is committed to Rene Preval, the impopulate President, and with its candidate Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expenditure shall be carried out in January.
All hopes in the elections have not yet been lost.
The two major candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rare, and Mirlande Manigat, an old lady, have retired its initial request in which they requested the non-evaluation of the vote.
But it may still be possible to address problems if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has a support, if someone has, has passed on the second round.
Bearing in mind that the epidemic of the Coller's cholery is casting the country and more than a million of the survivors of the earth continues to live in tents, a great abstention is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they did not achieve it because of a lack of organization.
Award of 250,000 identity documents, required to vote, have not yet been distributed a little before the elections.
There's a lot in the game.
The aid donors consider that the election of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as she has remained patent, they also think that the Haitian own.
Starting from points to the center
In the weeks that they have passed since he lost his husband, Cristina Fernandez, President of Argentina, has enjoyed a great public sympathy that has increased its population index in 20 points, up to more than 50 per cent, the highest level recorded from its election in 2007.
Nevertheless, that you can turn it into a outcome campaign for a second mandate in the elections of the year, it will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs. Fernandez left the intransibility of his husband disadvantage, his predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the indications are not concluded.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to be charged by the economic policy even after his wife had been President, had the cost of developing budgets that undervalued tax income, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidency marriage to pay additional income to their discretion.
In theory, the Government of Mrs Fernández lost his majority in the Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation which began after the fall of Kirchner because of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the peronist movement in power faced Mrs. Fernández.
However, after some caotic sessions on which a deputy gave him a punch at the face and other Members accused the Sugar Government, the Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to discuss," said the President.
The 2010 budget will therefore be applied for the next year, which will provide to the President a far more action margin at the time of expenditure.
The economy is significantly improved: probably grows up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1 per cent but numerous private calculations, besides the salarial requirements of incidents, are approximately 30 per cent.
Mr. Kirchner, who assembled the power in 2003 when Argentina was on the edge of the economic collapse, made that growth and poverty reduction were its priorities instead of inflation control.
It was refused to negotiate with the FMI, pressed the private sector and made INDEC, the statistical institution, adapting official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now manage these policies?
He held meetings between the private sector and the leaders of the incidents.
In addition, their officials claim that salarial increases will be limited in the next year to 18 per cent.
The economy has been affected by the high prices of the argentin agricultural exports worldwide.
However, inflation has limited the impact of growth achieved by a large devaluation in 2002.
Maybe it is why Mrs. Fernández is giving signs to want to restore Argentina’s financial links with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the Government agreed with the goods holders who had rejected a forced restructuring before the debt that Argentina had not been subscribed in 2001.
It seems now that Mrs. Fernández is about to celebrate an agreement with the assured Governments at the Paris club, which must be around $6,700 million.
Kirchners always stressed that this would not affect FMI monitoring, as it would be usual.
However, in the past month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will provide "technical assistance" to develop a new rate index for national consumption, which seems to be the prelusion of the INDEC cleanness.
It is not clear if President Fernández wants to continue in the policy when he has completed its mandate, taking into account that he has no husband any more on his side.
If it's done, you'll need to gain support for the media class, large part of which the kirchnerism has been stopped.
When the argentins return from their stative holidays in March, the sympathy oil for it will be decayed.
If you want to gain other elections, you must decide whether he reviews or not, with quietness, many of your husband's policies.
Middle Aurora for China
Taiwan voters are slowly close to a kind of closer unit with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about his grand brother on the other side of the street?
More than 7,5 million voters, 70 per cent of the electoral, accepted the elections and concejals of five urban districts, as seems to be a wide assessment of the President, Maing-Jeou.
Mr. Ma has become a defender of the continent's feelings, entrusted an innovative business links, including a partial free trade agreement, the greatest change in the relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma had the test, but a little bit.
Although its Kuumintang game (KMT) has been won three of the five elections, he did not get the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressorist Party (PPD), which has been addressed by a total independence of Taiwan, has actually obtained 50 per cent of all votes against 45 per cent of the KMT.
If you were the presidency, Mr Ma would be in problems.
Since its election two years ago, the percentage of votes of its party has reduced around 8 per cent.
The first time, the PPD initiated the KMT in the meetings.
The elections could be seen the typical elements of the Thai election elections, including rudde campaign trucks and large aglomerations with banderits and blue girls.
It has never falled the mystery attempt of rigor murder.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary Chairman of the KMT, was doing campaign by one of the KMT candidates night before the elections.
A man of the multitude disappeared the young man directly on his face, smoking him and killing a transean.
The curious is that it could not be able to determine whether the man was intended to harm Lien or to come from the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen said, the PPD leader, the tiroteo affected the elections, seeming suspicions on the PPD and provocing the voters to be moved by the KMT.
Maybe the only large winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprised that the continent's case was not in itself.
Instead, candidates talked about public housing and employment plans.
Taiwán usually enjoys its independence of fact and defends the military threat of China.
The KMT therefore urges to prevent its links to the Government in Pychen.
But this time the PPD also refused to emphasized the feeling against China.
It responds to the new consciousness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
By its part, Mr Ma confirmed that his policy in terms of China was acceptable for most of the Thai.
The Pekín Government is expected to continue to support them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to ensure that Taiwan returns to the road.
China has not lost time by sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on the protection of investment and medical cooperation.
Unfortunately, you would also like to achieve political integration, but first is the first.
The best will be waiting for the 2012 presidency elections.
In any case, the PPD has been re-invented.
It was two years ago in a bad situation: his old leader, Chen Shui-bian, was incarcerated in corruption.
The President between 2000 and 2008 was openly inspired by explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation of moderates has been overcome, and PPD is endeavoured to take care of professionals and young people.
Mrs Tsai has been welcomed as a candidate of PPD for the presidency, as Mrs Tseng-chang, who fulfilled the mandate under Chen.
Now your game is doing everything as possible by showing that you can also have relationships with Pekin.
Ms. Tsai announced the plans for establishing a group of experts acting as a contact point between PPD and China, while negotiations could be carried out without previous conditions.
Ms. Tsai said to the Taiwan public that its party represents a "fiable alternative" to Mr. Ma's precipitation in terms of China.
Mr. Chen seems anger for the change.
In a statement issued from its cell, he stated that the candidates of the PPD would have been better prepared if they would have stressed that Taiwan is an independent country.
Even he commanded Mr. Suh, a pragmatic, which would not be submitted to the presidency.
Even without the interview of Mr Chen, the PPD will have difficulty to choose between its potential candidates.
KMT should also make a conscience review.
Mr Ma's values have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth, the KMT candidates have not desired to make a campaign with him.
The lack of popularity seems to be mainly to unemployed and growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT portrait claims that it will restructur your store, as well as local teams.
The large samples of the PPD suggest that Taiwan support is limited.
At the same time, most Thais believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "and the point is not back."
Nominations to the Grammy: Jazz Esperanza Spalding is the surprise selection in the category of Artist revelation.
Does the request of a president and the people may be fixed in you.
Spealding, the barrier and jazz song of 26 years selected by President Obama to act in his ceremonie of the Nobel Price of the Peace in 2009, was issued one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a high-level appointment in the Major Artist Revelation category this year.
Bearing in mind that Spealding has been an appealed figure of jazz from its 2008 album, "Esperanza", the appointment gives what to think, but respects the Grammy's standards according to which a artist must be that has not been earned to the market more than three albums before grab the "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society", uncertainly exceeded a great progress and, taking into account its light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with pop influences, funk and Latin ritmos, you can at least establish a distinction between Spalding and the way towards the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for the Grammy voters, which have recently concentrated in the Jazz area for this category.
In the remaining categories, the Grammy voters honored the "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trio, a emotional and magic disco that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors the veteran saxofonist James Moody with "Mody 4B" and the teacher John Beasley by "Positootly".
Trombone Shorty, a favorite expert in New Orleans and usual invited to "Treme", HBO, was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which, for the rest, seems considerably to the fusion as in Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society had an unrecognized recognition in the category of large groups, composing against the great camera chamber of Billy Childs and the always arrayed Dave Holland, whose album live with its eight, "Pathways", was a great example of the democratic leadership of the battery in his band.
Notifications to the Grammy Price: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey's best classic album address
The names in the classic music area for the 53th edition of the Grammy Primes include a mixture of music and composers around the world.
The main names were for Michael Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machina", by plan and orquest, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for elektrical three movements.
Among the named links with South California the Estonian Composer Arvo Pärt is found by his sinfonship No 4, "Thes Angeles", a piece undertaken by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and exteriorated in the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based on Los Ángeles Avner Dorman is also appointed by his Mandolin Concerto.
The names of classic music are distributed in thirteen categories that cover orchest albums, oppere, coral and alone.
The classic producer category includes five names: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The named for the classic music album is Bruckner by the Sinfonias No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebau; Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Orquestta Sinfónica de Nashville; Steven Mackey by "Dreamhouse" of Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" of several artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi of Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the category of oppera, the named mountains are "Lulu" of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "L'Amor of Loin" of the German Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the orquest and core of Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.

The middle proposed in Temecula receives the adoption of the Order Committee
The project of mixture for Temecula has obtained a unique support of the local management commission after more than five hours of public witnesses, often accompanied.
Criticals attacked the project saying that terrorism and attacks would be promoted.
However, the members of the Committee decided the middle night that the new religious centre had respected local legislation and would be impresional from the ethical point of view.
"Much good people came to show their support, both Christians, both Jews or garabai, of all religions," said Nael, President of the Islamic centre of the valley of Temecula, the Thursday tomorrow.
"The truth is that, as an American citizen, I'm worried."
"Show justice. "
"The opposition is really minimum," adds.
"I just speaking very high."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting started at the six of the late and was practical to half night; the majority of the time was given to people who interfered in favour or against the center, practically the same amount in each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the web site of the newspaper.
"United States are no longer available," it is read in one of the comments.
"This is another planet of the simios with Mrs. Libertad died in the area."
"A America has falled."
The plans for construction of islamic centres also caused protests in other parts of the country, including close to the cereal area, the New York area, where the attacks were occurred on 11 September 2011.
In the Temecula Valley, the Mahmoud Harmoush image has declared acts of violence.
His neighborhood of 135 families have been a year by living without problems in Riverside, but he wanted a greater and better space than the store of shared property with a producer of water filtering systems.
The new mixture of 24.943 square feet, with a mediterranean architection style, would include two miners and be up to 43 feet.
It would be a surface of 4,32 acres in Nicolas Road, about two miles on the east of the Chaparral Institute.
The opponents can still repair the project before the municipal Council.
A resistent microbiotics planned the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or in other places
The discovery of a battery that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients extends the possibility of finding new forms of life in the Earth and, perhaps in other planets.
Although researchers discovered the wonderful bacteria here on Earth, they say that it is possible that there are forms of life without the main elements they considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"The growth may be with phosphate or with arsenic."
"It's a very harmful thing, although it's little lack to be a form of life really 'alenigena'," said Paul C. W. Davies of the Arizona State University, co-autor of the report shown in the online edition of the Thursday of Science.
Since time, there are six major elements of life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphate and sugar.
However, researchers discovered that the bacteria found in Mono Lake, California can continue to grow after replace the photo by the arsenic.
"Ariel D. Anbar of the Arizona State University, co-autor of the report, has been planned to you as possible."
According to Anbar, the foundation is important for the search for life in different planets in the earth, since researchers need to recognize life, know the aspect that they have.
The study focuses on a microbio covered on Earth.
However, the advocatory of a press route to discuss it, in which no details of discovery were reported, generated a great speculation on the Internet on the possibility that the report should indicate the discovery of extraternal life.
He didn't do it.
What the discovery "this shows that in other planetary entities, there might be institutions that could be used for other elements to stimulate its biochem and that the whole of "standar" elements we consider essential for life may not be so fill," said Charles Cockell, Cathedral of the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, the United Kingdom.
Cockell did not form part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the replacement of one element by the biochemic and the basic biochemic structure," added Cockell.
The discovery was not made by casuality.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrobiology Institute, which directed the study, focused on the Lake Mono because he presented high levels of arsenic.
Archaetical and phosphate are similar from the chemical point of view, so it speculated that a microbio outlined to both could replace one by another.
"The arsenic is mainly toxic because its chemical behaviour is similar to the phosphase."
"There may therefore be complicated to the different agencies."
"Again, the arsenic is sufficiently different than so that you don't work as well as the phosphate, so it comes and, in some way, applaims the biochimical machine," Anbar explains.
Researchers collected the recognised bacteria like GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increased arsenic concentrations, with which they had been adjusted and used to grow.
The microbiocycle grows better with phosphate, but the fact of demonstrating that you can live with arsenic place is planning the possibility of naturally existing a form of life that uses arsenic, both in other areas of Earth or other planet or moon where arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, pointed out that the idea that the arsenic can be replaced by the phosphar is not new, but never found an example that is shown.
The arsenic was most common in the first eras of the Earth, he pointed out, so the researchers speculated that the first forms of life could have been used.
"Yes, it suggests that there could be other means to generate life, not only how life was formed on the Earth," Foster said, that he was not part of Wolfe-Simon Research team.
Research provided the support of NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Institutes.
The rocked dogs that were missing in Compton
The two dogs lacking from the four rods in front of the Bellflower engine were found, according to the officers of the Los Angeles Conduct, the Thursday.
The four dogs of competition, two Akites and two corgi galeses Pembroke, disappeared the march when someone rolled Chevrolet Express from 2006 in which they were going over the night, faced with Bellflower Motel 6, as noted by the authorities.
Two of the cancers were recovered the middle afternoon, and the two remainers found the middle after night, as Steve Whitmore reported, a portrait of the Low Sheriff Chair of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that the dogs are well," said Whitmore.
"You're in a good state."
"They returned with their owner's laws."
Whitmore did not indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which barry, nor the circumstances of the discovery.
"There is carrying an investigation."
"We don't mean anything," said Whitmore.
"We're following a pants."
The owners of dogs couldn't be found, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, to make some commentary the Thursday.
They gathered together with their two Akites in a railway of animals in Downey the middle of the late.
Sheriff helpers found the furgone and the two dogs separated in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Acites (Trace, a dog of 3 years, and said, a dog of 10 months) had not suffered damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit in the competitions of the area this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of dogs, continued disappeared until the middle of the night.
Peek and Rickard, who lived in Redding, were in the city for the national campaign AKC/Eukanuba in Long Beach this week end and had an intention to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs would exhibite them in other competitions for the days before AKC/Eukanuba campaign, as indicated Peek to The Times the middle.
South California is one of the backs in practically two months performing the couple participating in Canadian competitions.
On Monday by night, Peek and Rickard made the check-in in the motor.
Normally they remain in motors and split the furgone right in front of the window of their room.
They leaving three dogs (one boxer cry, a territory Parson Russell and a Brittany, who slepted with them in the motorroom.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the furgone because they had a very green hair and would be fresh.
They left lightly open sales so dogs could respirate fresh air.
Peek and Rickard declared the robot of the moonet on Tuesday's six morning.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, microchips to identify them.
The Thursday was not clear if it would be a reward or not.
The leon is ready to back again, while MGM restructuring will result in the final approval of the short
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM finally made green light to start again.
The Thursday, a federal banking judge of New York officially adopted the "prepared" plan for creditors to remove approximately $5 million, starting the way to undertake 86-year maintenance company with its efforts in production and television films and programs.
The fall of Thursday confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the United States Banking Code, so there are no other legal obstacles to the MGM to relation to the funders of Spiyglas Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will be converted to the main executions of the study that will be reduced.
The staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 integrated.
In fact, MGM will not go out from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase will cover a planned credit instrument of $500 million to finance the operations and production of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently synchronized by the credit, which is due to $75 million, and it is expected to be funded by average December.
The study restructuring process began in May 2009, when the Moelis and Co Investment Bank was agreed to give advice to the management necessary for the management of its financing, while he fighted to make payment for $300 million per year.
In August, the Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an former President of Enron and expert in the recovery of enterprises in quiebra, known by his work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper attempts to solve MGM's financial challenges and satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the study, required more time for the expectation.
After a few months of discussion, the parties agreed to put the company on sale at the end of 2009.
However, the subsistence was paid to few posts and no one was willing to pay the over $2 million that were looking for creditors.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began to work in a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disappearances, finally supported by creditors at the end of October.
When the MGM officially goes from the bankerroat in the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper companys will receive multi-mulonary corrections for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1,2 million, will receive $9.5 million.
Cooper's companys, which have paid $375,000 per month for their company's administration services, will receive a number of "hearns" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum planned to renew the production in MGM, which was only a film this year, and gathered a seven or eight films that will go out in 2012.
They also plan two films based on "El Hobbit", together with Warner Bros.
The study needs to concert a separate rate between 265 and 275 million to finance their part of these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investors Carl Icahn, who has approximately 18% of the MGM debt, had tried to correct a fusion of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the greatest accentiate.
However, the recent conversations between the two companies were not in an agreement.
Tech Today wants to maintain the balance of your budget for gifts
While the iPad is the principal candidate to be the most wonderful player of this year, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video games system, both can mean a significant mile in your budget for gifts.
Think that a iPad price can be bought five BMX bicycles of 99 dollars each one, and a Kinect game cares the same as 10 classic salt records with accounts, or approximately 48 lakes from Play-Doh.
But there are ways to maintain their budget for them in balance.
Recently visited three national players, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" You and BJ's Chileale Club, to see that electronic players could buy at least 80 dollars.
It was immediately clear that the Moore Act has been working; the technological player of this year probably will have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to the past year.
Furthermore, while there are generally less new players with connected websites, two of the most known sites, Webkinz and Club Pengun, have more offers.
And the players impulsed by button piles are increased, as well as the players with reloadable battery.
There are some recommendations.
(All prices are Toys "R" You, unless you are given in another way).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars, for 3 years and more) are 3-year-olds of the size of a cobayo that canch a note when their barriers are opened.
An appointment equals a notice, and a second appeal begins to arm a song.
If you're buying more than one, they're gonna knock in harmony.
Precaution: Once it begins to press, you can't stop.
For a combination with bathroom, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Prece, 60 dollars, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking the Elmo Live technology in the past year, the animatronic museum of 14 roads playing changing games like Simóm Dice, and you can make the lunch step thanks to its innovators with roads with block device.
Children who tried to play the player used to Mickey as a bath instructor, even though their parents were dismissed because of the lack of volume control.
If you're a child in the 1980s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computer education players.
He returned (Hasbro/Playskool, 40 dollars, for 3 years and more) with a full of questions cards designed to transform a passover in a meeting with a busy seat of self-recording performances.
If you're encouraging to give your child your smart phone, there will be three independent alternatives.
VTech MobiGo (60 dollars, 3 to 8 years) is the most barried and easier to use, presenting a qvaluy key; even though games do not teach the same effectively like Leapster Explorer (70 dollars, 3 to 12 years), is the first starting on the Leapster line, with a new and brillant screen.
No version is compatible with the old carts.
iXL de Fisher-Price (90 dollars, 3-7 years) uses a iTunes type system to present games and e-books, and has a rand for SD cards that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for eight years and more) is a game of five blocks far larger than a kitchen box, each with his own LED screen.
The goal is to arm words by closing blocks before the time reaching; it is formable for an unprofited competition of words-based arms.
They're always more players who have some online connection class.
Only on your presence in players, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your son a online mask on the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Club Pengun 2" Mix'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, 6-12 years) which includes a currency with a hidden code.
When you cancel the online code, your son has sufficient credits in the Club Penguin tent for two articles.
These could include pockets on roads or a Mascota Puffle play.
It's easierly larger than your dent cell, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) the last in a microbot line pumped by button piles.
The false insecto moves quickly on 12 plates of silver that you see, in aleatorial directions.
It's nice to make a blow browser to see if you can find the exit.
It's too long.
Our man was able to leave the kitchen table and even pass a time in the mouth of our dog.
A more moderate side of the order maintenance in China is promoted
As a city instructor, Tang Shenbin marked the step on a street of the city, inspecting severely to the nervous people at his charge, emitting orders in a lower voice with military authority.
He wished the women of Chengoua, the police officers of China, feared and disappeared by their powerful heavy measures and their objection to violence, communicate a certain impression to an spectator's push.
"Firmes!"
"Attention!"
"What are the good girls?"
Four girls who have just passed adolescents with white guants and all green olive oil and screens corrected to call attention.
Four black pairs completely aligned.
Four elegant sharps who are perfectly collapsed above the hair with moons to black and white rayas.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, pregnantly.
"The models are linds."
More than a government has tried to clean the image of the urban inspectors in China.
One city ordered all the new recruitments to have a title of level.
The Province of Guangdong changed the green colour of uniforms to a more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced the use of the intimidating force: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officials turned to a snack card dishwasher, and observed it with the census constantly fruited for average hours until the driver collected his things and left.
Xindu, a urban district of 680,000 residents in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has added its urban police 13 women, expressly elected by appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the police a sweetest side, female.
Unfortunately, until Scarlett Johansson, it should be necessary to fight to increase China's respect for these squadrons of the city.
And for a good reason, they would argue the criticals.
Apart from the police, these officials are authorised only to comply with the town orders, imposing many and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese media are rutinically different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei killed a transemptor after using their cell to film them while solving a protest against a disaster.
Last year, a manual of training for inspectors of Pekin was mounted and published on the Internet, which was described as a efficiency to crimes without blood.
This year, a ambulant walker of sandries in Shanghai suffered a damage of cerebral after a river with five officials.
A full violence video game, available to download online, presents inspectors conducted by Chineses who attack road vendors.
"Chengguan has left a cicatriz in the government," said China Daily, a national publication, last year after another tactic conflict.
The newspaper demanded "really meticulous cleansing".
The sceptics say that the current approach is very far from this.
After the district, eight new female recruits in October, a editorial at The Beijing Evening News was asked whether women had real needs or were just a Scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both things.
The notice of the District of Women's candidates from 18 to 22 years, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial races".
They should have a height above the average, above 1,6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1月2 pounds.
26-year-old retirement is obligation.
The officials said that the work was physically too hard for women with over 25 years.
"Your image is the important thing," said an anonymous district officer to Rednet.com, a governmental web site cuas.
"Therefore, the external quality of the candidates shall determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial races, etc.".
Then the temperature comes "and the internal qualitys".
The girls are like flowers, said, and added: "Although they are flowers, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, subdirector of the District City Office, is not concerned to support this description.
But he noted that the demands of height were standard in many Chinese warnings for both sex.
Then the requirement of harmony facial races comes.
If this means to be uncertain, it is a matter of debate between the Chineses.
The small or degraded decorated must not be presented.
"We can't let a coffee person or a jorobad come to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who pairs the Baoguang Place near a monastery, has 22 years old, with its colorful mixtures and a softly cure mouth.
She doesn't believe that the hundreds of their aspects are sexy, she said.
"You think I look sexy with this uniform?" he asked with a sharp look.
His working partner, Xu Yang, 21 years old, said, "Our work should present the image of the city."
They have not been opposed to their work at a certain time, they said, because they open higher road ambitions that are just helping vendors in the streets where they are supposed to be spelled by their business.
Every morning the squadron is covered more or less than a tenth of ambulant vendors who are launched or on bicycle, trying to sell so many paint or toffee tanks as possible before they are thrown.
"Mr. Wang, you must go."
"We have said to you many times!" said Mrs Xu while a sellman flew up, with timely leaveing his car ticked by bicycle with faith guarns.
The officials describe their requirements as more than abusors.
"It's more or less than the same day every day," Huang Jing, said, of 20 years, who are the sea marketing in his free hours.
"My rutinary."
One reason is that women's officers are missing from the power of their male homologs to confid the merchantship of the vendors.
They can only threaten the offenders to their men supervisors.
This holds them to protect the public demonstrations of soulliness against burocracy, common in all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunan, were mourned after the false rumor was dispersed by the murder of the Chengou officials.
More than one tenth of cops or officials of Czech Republic have been hurt in the night episodio; 14 government vehicles were flowed or took fire.
At the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But quiet is still guaranteed.
Only on two roads of the Plaza Baoguang Plaza, where women's officers patrulled that morning, more than 50 people gathered together in a kitchen.
The officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was refunded in the steel instead of a workshop, as required by the regulation.
The owner of the motor cried hurtlessly.
The situation has been stealed for 15 minutes before the officers, with a huge face, move the cods to their vehicles and quickly go with the motorcycle and the owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a male-co-coordinator, remained behind, with his back white name to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men of 40 years or more, play a pure role of support.
On the other hand, they do not teach them to keep an elegant image.
"It is sometimes we fight. "
"After we fight physically," said Mr. Li with total naturality.
"The majority of the time is the public who begins the pit."
Prosecutors do not impose charges against Senator Underline
The Senator's lawyers declared that the fiscals of the Department of Justice had sponsored the Senator John Embassment of the Criminal Incumbents, which had come from their business with a former campaign assistant and its efforts to ensure work through the lobby for the husband of the woman.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat than the Ensemble, the Republic of Nevada that was considered as possible by the Republic of the Republic of Justice for 2012, until the scanning of it on its national affairs last year and damages its road.
The Authority said that it was "certainly content" by the decision, which came after an overall year's investigation.
The Senator could still face a disciplinary measure of the Senate Committee for Ethics.
The appointment lawyers said that the Department of Justice had "informed us that the Senator Undertaking is no more a goal of its investigation and that he has no plan to make charges against him on this subject."
The Department of Justice did not like to comment on the case.
The advertisement was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said that there were significant evidence to indicate that Ensemble could have been made to violate a federal prohibition on lobby.
The interviews, e-mail and other documents that were first published in October 2009 in New York Times showed that Ensigno had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of its assistants, to obtain lucrative work through lobby, to reach Hampton's silence and his wife, Cynthia, on the case of the Senator with her.
Mrs Hampton once worked as a teacher of an Ensign campaign.
It has been contacted with several political sponsors to find Mr. Hampton's work, and he bound on behalf of them after they had paid Mr. Hampton to make lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
As Hampton was recently an institute assistant, it was excluded according to the law to make lobby for his former employer or Senate for a year.
The enthusiastic experts said that the inusual agreement between Ensigno and Hampton, who were friends before the business, appeared in disagreement with the call "revolution by lobbing bank", which seeks to restrict that former State employees use their connections to make personal businesses.
On the evidence that has been made public, "recovered to be a first case in the face of a conspiration to violate substantially the revolving status by", said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer which is specialised to defend customers investigated by the government.
While officials of the Department of Justice refused to explain the rationalization in the case of appointment, Mr. Brand and other ethnic lawyers said that the Department seemed to accept political processing after several important reviews for their public integrity section, including the decision of the past year to abandon the processing against the former Senator Ted Stevens, in the middle of bad proceedings.
Federal fiscals "There are clearly a couple of cobardes," said Melanie Sloan, executive Director of City for Responsibility and Ethiopia in Washington, a defence group who brings several queries against Ensigno in the case.
"It is basicly mean that high-range government officials can now suggest that laws do not apply to them," added.
Paul Coggins, the main lawyer of Ensignment, said in an interview he received a telephone call from a fiscal of the Department of Justice the moon and another called more on the next day, saying that the department would not want to uphold charges against his customer.
The Entitle Defence team was cooperating with taxes in the attempt to convince them that the Senator, as his office reiterated in a statement, had "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins was refused to explain with details the legal arguments that he gave the taxes.
"I don't feel comfortable in details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they have taken the right decision," said he.
In the past month, the Federal Commission decided to change an investigation in a case separated by the Ethic Group, which states that $96,000 of the Entitled Parents had violated the Federal Electoral Law.
The electoral committee said that he had no sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the money was not more than a gift.
NV Energy is a important company of Nevada who had supported the Senator for a long time, which had made work through lobby thanks to the assistance he gave it to Hampton.
A email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, the chief of Enname, John Lopez, was communicated with Hampton and told him that he was "matching" the Ministry of Interior on a question in dispute.
He also attended a dinner with Hampton and another client of Nevada, Algiant Air, and called the Transport Secretariat to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he bound Hampton to lobby.
When first appeared the news of the case last year, He asked for his electors to forgive his position as a fourth leader of the Republic in the Senate.
After maintaining a lower profile for a months ago, he told the journalists who planned to request a third mandate in the Senate.
When the Ensignor, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensigno was no object of criminal investigation, said that the Senator expected that the Ethic Committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and conclude its investigation.
"The Senator Ensign has desires to continue with its difficult work on behalf of Nevada people," said.
Cheshire's appeal will touch Twitter
There was a 12-year-old of them "chatting" in the court hall.
Wait a minute, they sent reports of the spanish witness to Twitter.
Finally, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter's reports on the process he addressed the violation and children at their beds in a house that was taken fire.
Thursday, the broadly followed process by Steven J. Hayes, who was condemned by the murder of three members of a family of Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official end, with the imposing of the judge of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But the lawyers of Mr Hayes have written in the court to describe the arguments of the appeals that will probably take care of the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reports on the process, including the wide use of Twitter by the periodists of massive information media, created a "atmosphere" and that generalized and immediate saturated saturated with high-details made public steps to operate an inadequate influence on the jury.
The appointment could oblige the judges of appeal to lie with the question whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"In what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the court is affecting the rights of the person to have a right process," said Thomas J. Ullmann, head lawyer of Mr. Hayes.
The judge of first instance Jon C. Blue, of the Supreme Court, rejected the requests in a fair week, saying that the media were "hotly controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been brought by the past.
But probably it will not be the last word on the subject.
During the decades, the Courts of Appeal recognized that the coverage of celebrated cases may generate questions on the impartiality of a process.
In a historical fault of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States revoked the condemnation of an osteopate of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, by the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the case Sheppard vs. Maxwell, who had "a carnaval atmosphere in the process" because of the media.
It is believed that the crime was inspired by the television program and the "The refugee" film.
Some lawyers said that the courts of appeal who considered the condemnation of Mr. Hayes half a century later could feel intrinsed by the argument that new rules could be necessary to control the form of communication from the court halls, something unrealisable in the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason of concern about the impact of the new media" in high profile processes, John J. Donohue III, a professor of Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty of Connecticut and wrote a report in which it was said that it was arbitrarily imposed.
Dr. Donohue said that some courts of appeal could feel intrinsed because of the idea that the immediate communication was limited from the court rooms could make the judges more fair.
Twitter's question is only one of the many of the subjects described by Hayes' lawyers, which probably will be discussed for years, passing out.
The lawyers of the defence also claim that you could have been condemned when the Blue Judge refused them to test the reactions of potential jury, showing the photographs of the crime's scene during the selection of the jury.
Some jury said they were horrorized by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and her daughters, Hayley, of 17 and Michaela of 11.
The defence lawyers say that they will also ask the constitutionality of the penalty of death and support that the judge was wrongly removed to a jury who had criticised the fiscals, and that he was wrongly pressed for a prosecutor for his extra decision to order him to the jury to discuss during a week end.
The jury were not covered.
But their arguments on the impact of the intense coverage of the process can take the major interest.
They observed a recruitment to the archived verification in the past month that the case had homed news to Connecticut and was discussed during the electoral campaign by candidates for manager and Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media continued to throw the fire of the emotion on the case.
"The daily aglomeration of the centers of the media, cameras and reporters outside the court," the lawyers wrote, "who never seen here in New Haven and perhaps in all the state."
Your attention in the Tweeter cover is contrary.
In some interviews, some journalists said that immediate news were more important than the slowly delivered reports were a played vision that the court's policy on coverage control would be weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that the courts of appeal were often acquired by the arguments on adaptation requested by the courts because of social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressing for this advertisement.
In his writing, the 1966 decision of the Supreme Court was reiterated, which rejected the condemnation of Dr. Sheppard because of the coverage of the process, and made clear that new means would require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the XXI century."
Can the civism draw a kit to join the divisions?
After an invisible and negative campaign, this week has been disappeared a bit of civism in Washington.
Is it a print of a real bipartist cooperation or an ilusary time before a rapid return to the participation fight in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress did not have progress on the major issues that should be treated during the outcoming meeting.
But it was at least a short discussion on the differences of the two parties, and a recognition of its shared responsibilities to rule, instead of being another empty episode to gain partidist points.
The public meeting of the President ' s deficit commission was also civilized, despite the political differences that substantive among members.
It seems clear that the stretch interaction for a month has generated a mutual respect that transcends the ideological breach that is still separated to the members.
This is not enough to state that a new was of cooperation has arrived.
The two parties are now in a trial period, climbing mutually to identify co-operative signs and commitments, while they try to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed party war.
The marges meeting and the follow-up assessments of the same by participants were made with a minimum requirements or accused.
The philosophic differences between Obama and the Republics are too large and are deeply erected as to propose any fast climate change that has been in the last two years.
In the case of tax, costs, health or social assistance, the two parties are in oil pools.
In all ways, the election of November has shot the humor in Washington, at least at a short time.
"It is no doubt that things have changed in the way to say things", said Pete Wehner, a official of Bush's administration now in the Technical and Public Politics Centre.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
The elections are stirred up Partary steps, then extracted.
That's good."
In some issues, in particular those containing in the agenda of the coming meeting, the Republics and Democrats have no other option to find a solution.
Bush's tax reductions will be achieved at the end of the year, and nobody is for that.
Both parties want to find a way to keep some or all reductions, permanently or timely.
In the same way, it is likely that there is an commitment to extend unemployment subsidies, probably because the Republics cannot believe that they are for the reduction of tax for rich, denied the unemployed subsidies for unemployed workers.
After the Saturday meeting in the White House, there is more optimistic for a possible treaty on these issues during the coming meeting, together with the ratification of the new Nuclear Disarmament Union START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston, from the Brookings Institute, announce that cooperation achieved in the early issues of the outcoming meeting will not necessarily lead to a continuing bipartidism when the new 112th. The Congress will meet in January.
In contrast, he confirmed that it is very likely and inevitable, that it begins a period of disappearance.
"After the things to be done, the psychology will shortly return to a comparison" confirmed.
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) on the fact that the civism can lead to a real cooperation.
"I see the majority of what will happen between now and 2012 as a test for the main event of 2012," confirmed.
The reasons have a lot to see with the establishment of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, which have decisively contributed to their creation.
In addition to awareness of the leaders of the Republics on the danger of exertion of their position, they know that they should try to fulfil their promises to cover the costs of the state and announce the new health law.
These particular lines are already clearly observed in the initial reactions against the recommendations of the Deficit Committee, including the reform of the tax code and the increase in certain taxes and age of jubilation, and the expenditure of expenditure.
Chairmans Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been responsible for one of the most difficult work in Washington and, according to their own appreciation, have introduced the question of the deficit in the public order of a way that can't be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the Commission of 18 members to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been fighting for reaching that figure.
The greatest resistence is among the officers chosen in the panel, suggesting that there are at least few bases or desires for the commitment.
Galston provides two stages in the battle between the Republics of the White House and the Congress.
The first will happen in the next year as part-shake, when the Republics dismisse Obama on the budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of more bilateral cooperation.
What would change?
Public opinion.
There are considerable evidence that, despite the recent election party, most of the Americans still want to see both parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead point, as happened in 1995, then both parties will take care of the reaction of people.
Everyone who considers that you're probably losing will change the course and will find an commitment.
However, this may be an optimistic vision.
The Participation and Polarization are now greater than the average of 1990s, and seems to have a greater ideological warm between Obama and the Republic of the Congress between President Bill Clinton and the Republics at its time.
At the same time, both parties-activists are 2010 as the prejudice to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Damn this reality, the civilism that is shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require more efforts from both sides to find common points in the issues that are still divided by them.
A United States filtered back to Moscú as the Paradise of corruption
The control of the city is in hands of a "clubcracy" and leaves a part of the sovereignty and protection money that returns directly to Kremlin, as reported in February, the United States Ambassade in Russia.
It was informed that both the police and the Federal Safety Service managed huge systems, which helps to explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They serve money not only from legal business, but also from organized criminal groups.
Any stage of the burocracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the " vertical authority", takes its part as a measure that the money governs on the scale.
The notice, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyle, was published by WikiLeaks on your website the middle of the Middle.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censured.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still alcald of Moscú, and it was the guilty of corruption.
The President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed it in October, but has been a few evidence of cleanness since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who has an important construction company, have systematically rejected corruption accusations over the years, and has gained several demands for liberality on such accused.
In September, when in a Russian television channel asked him about a documentary that would suggest that he was corrupt, he confirmed: "He's a slight, a patrain, a fast."
According to the investigations, Russians believe a abrumador that their society is corrupt.
But it is insufficient to find details explained in detail, since they were in the emblemishment report, and it is not obvious to be the diplomatics of a foreign country who do so.
"The direct slabons of the Government of the city of Moscow with criminality have brought some to call 'disfusional' and to affirm that the Government works more as a climbocy than a government," states the notice.
"The criminal elements enjoy a "krysha" (a term of the criminal and mafia world, which literally means "tech" or protection) translating the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the tax office, as well as all sectors of the burocracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analists identifi a three-level structure in Moscow criminal world."
"Luzhkov is on the highest."
"SFS, MVD and military are at the second level."
"First, common crimes and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups are filled with an empty in certain areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report claims that the SFS recovers the money of the larger enterprises, and that the police approaches small trades.
A source, stated in the report, "reclaimed that Moscow trade owners understood that the best is to achieve the protection of MVD and SFS (because of the organized crime groups) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups but also protected by law."
"Therefore, protection against criminal guards is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while the recovery of money is complete, protection may be irregular; even those paying are subject to arrest.
Those who don't pay quickly find their business closed by a pretext or other.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that it has been a little progress.
The note of the posting reports about men taking maltes, probably full of money in effective, within the same Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must trust in the burocrates," said Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem Expert Group in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this burocracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no political class in Russia."
No political, without opposition, without separation of powers, confirmed corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Inde believes that corruption costs Russia more than $300 million per year.
In a recent investigation on global corruption concepts carried out by non-governmental Transparency International Organization, the country was classified at post 154 (the countries are classified at least to the most corrupt).
The revelation of the notice of the United States Embassy, which has not occurred until late hour of Moscú, will certainly cause dissolution within the Russian government, and despite that Luzhkov can be offended by Moscow's weaknesses, could be an opportunity to make Cremlin argument that is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the WikiLeaks documents might be lie and reacted as a result of an revelation that stated that the United States diplomatics called it Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policies in this country," he confirmed.
"But to be honest with you, we don't suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it was done in such an immoral way."
The Veterans of the Red Yemers obligation to face the past
In a concretely slightly lighted room, with mixed walls and decade, the Director of the School Second Anlong Veng remembered the man he had built it, the last leader of the Red Jemers Ta Mok.
"There all like Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader, and he was worried about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "the Carnicero" for his brutality during the government of the Red Yemers, the commander remains popular in this ex-round strength of the Red Jemers in the north-west of Cambodia, where he built hospitals, punts and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemers turn to the government, the sustained loyalty for a long time is finally disappeared in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for the truth and reconciliation allowed the victims who were publicly victims who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a book of secondary school text that first teachs him the history of the Red Jemers to the children of his former soldiers.
And in July, a mixed court of the United Nations and Cambodia issued the first condemnation of a former member of the Royal Jemers, sentenced the former chief of the known Torture Centre Tuol Sleng, King Khek Iev, best known as Duch, 35 years of prison.
With each of these events, carefulness has grown among the Red Yemers of Anlong Veng, complementing the efforts to reconciliation and its attempts to reintegrate the camboyan society.
"There is a resentment and fear between the former Royal Jemeres, but they can't do nothing," said Chhang Youk, Director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Jemers was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within the family."
During the Government of the Red Yemers of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, they were killed or died by hunger, sickness or exchange of work, approximately 1,7 million people.
When the Vietnamites had invaded and shot the leading government by Poland in 1979, the rest of the regime and its military forces fled to the Cambodia border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection to the last movement reared in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the war of wars from their bases on the mountains and the forests of West Cambodia, Ta Mok built followers in Anlong Veng.
But in average of the 1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations leading to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, large groups of the Royal Yemers began to destroy the government, culminating in Ieng Sary performances in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died from natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was taken by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Montañas Dangrek.
He died in Phnom Penh's prison in 2006 while he was waiting for the process.
Without the support of their well-beings, the oldest fighters of the Red Yemen fell into the absolute damage that is common in the rural Cambodia, and many are nottalized by movement.
Although a few of the Red Jemers electoral officers kept their local administrative posts to change their arms, Rail soldiers continue to be poor and unqualified farmers.
"They people have received little benefits after the reconstruction," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout the Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have integrated the useful agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They were cried without any concept to do business."
Lim, 55-year-old, who joined the Royal Jemers when he was a adolescent in 1974, played in the forest near Anlong Veng before he was dedicated to life as a poor tree farmer in 1998.
"The life with the Red Jemers was good," he confirmed.
"The Mok gave him to eat all."
"But now life is hard because we have to be self-sufficient."
The current court of the Red Jemers has also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of the next year, it is expected that the court begins to process Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Royal Yemen.
The Court's mandate is to process the main leaders and those of greater responsibility for crimes, but he did not say if it would pursue cases further than these four.
This does not serve much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent speculation of the media has focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who was a head of district in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the Red Jemers Government at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the investigators of the Cambodia Documentation Centre that had overseeing the construction of Trapeang Thma Press, a project that believes that thousands of forced workers died.
During a late afternoon, Im Chaem returned to work on the fields to his house on wood pilots on a landway on the outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun dropped long shadows on the rise past, In Chaem refused to speak about his past in the Red Jemers.
She stated that if the court had not been invited, it would not be presented.
"Camboya is in peace and stability," confirmed.
"If there are more processions, it will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who dismissed from the Red Yemers in 1978, also reiterated that the court will be unestimable if the court is more suspected, although the experts and stories will ask it.
"Camboya must fall a hook and bury the past," he confirmed.
But face the past is just what Cambodia needs to do to progress, said Chhang Youk, of the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is back to join the rock pieces" confirmed.
"It's our obligation to meet these rocks so we can understand."
The center produced the first book of text adopted by the Government on the Red Yemeres, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addendum to the book of secondary school history of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Yemers.
As in most of Cambodia, young people of Anlong Veng knows few details about the Red Jemers, despite the link of the city with the regime.
Even Valeak, 19-year-old, a student in the Anlong Veng Second School, said that the new text book helped students to understand an important part of his history.
But his parents reacted with scepticism when he brought the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the text book and the court," he confirmed.
"They have suspects because they are not sure of the amount of persons who will process the court."
This resistance made the process of reconciliation to be complex and difficult, confirmed Sok Leang.
But public forums, the book of text and the court are starting to make an impact, confirmed.
In any way, here are the Red Jemers who keep a powerful pleasure.
In the Montañas Dangrek, a path with bad herbs and covered plastic plastic cups leads to a rectangle of the black hole covered by a oxidated oxidated hole.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a monster of noutics after death in 1998.
Sothea, 31-year-old, a cell solder on the side of the road, said that he didn't know much about the man who was crowded there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place to take it," he confirmed.
It was Christ Sothea's birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of the last rescue of Pol Pot, where he would leave a mature plastic hand with hope to have a good luck.
Bielorusia accepts repeal to its qualified warranty reservation
In a surprising victory for the campaign of President Obama to protect nuclear material throughout the world, the Government of Bielorusia announced the middle of which he would notice its highly rich uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The treaty was revealed in a joint statement published after the Minister for Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergei Martynov at the margin of a security summit.
For years, the American government had tried to convince Bielorusia that he would reject its highly enriched uranium and seemed they had come to a point without returning the past.
But the United States officials said to Washington After a couple of operations classified with Bielorrusia in the past two months to retire 84.82 kg calibrated uranium for the weapons of a Bielorusian research installation.
This prepared the field for the mercury agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to a official, which spoke from the anonimate because of the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the Nuclear Security Summit of 47 nations presided by Obama in April, which excluded Bielorusia.
And it was a good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summer in 2012.
"I really felt excited because they want a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This demonstrates that this process is working," said Ken Lungo, President of the Global Security Society, a group which promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said that the agreement is "a very significant and important step" given by Bielorrusia.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all the vulnerable nuclear material throughout the next four years.
Since then, the United States has helped six countries to disappear all its highly enriched uranium.
Bielorusia would be the seventh.
A tenth of countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Nuclear Safety Summit of Obama, the Belarus Chairman Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation would never reply to his uranium.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium ( hundreds of kilograms of what is basicly qualified arms uranium) and the urany of under-riching," said Lukashenko at that time.
"This is our first material... we're not gonna make sugar bombs, and we're not gonna sell anybody."
"We use it with research purposes, it's all."
However, Bielorrusia came to the United States a few months ago, showing interest in reaching an agreement.
The officers stated that the first task to retire Bielorusia uranium in October was particularly complicated, since the material had been slightly irradiated.
The officers said that he was loaded in a special train traveling over 2.000 km to a Russian installation for storage and removal.
According to officials, the second operation ended the month and was made in aircraft.
The United Government paid $13 million for the tasks, and the majority of the money was used to provide Bielorrusia's research installation with low-rich warranty uranium, which is not adequate for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a official of the Department of Energy working in the Reducing of Global Amenace, said that "It was coordinated and very carefully warranted to strengthen confidence".
James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation studies estimated that year that Bielorrusia had at least 40 kilograms of warranty qualified for arms, and hundreds of highly enriched uranium.
Bielorusia will try to remove its reservation until 2012, according to the joint declaration.
The relations between Bielorrusia and the United States have been tended for years, especially because of the warrant repression of the human rights of Lukashenko.
But the Middle declaration suggested a potential detention.
It was stated that "effective progress in these global security issues, the United States and Bielorusia recognized that more respect for democracy and human rights in Bielorusia remains a central issue to improve bilateral relations, and that is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish Government did not repair the CIA flights
The Spanish Government has not retained the CIA flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda directed Guantánamo by Spanish territory, as expressed in a telegram of the EEA in Madrid.
This reflects the filtered (cables) documents by Wikileaks to the daily The country, where the first Vice-President of the Government, Mary Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish executive was informed to "populate to demonstrate that they have exercised an appropriate monitoring on foreign aircrafts that have passed through Spain".
In June 2006, after a report of the European Council in which he accused of complicity in human rights practices to a tenth of countries, including Spain, was held a meeting between the former North American Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández of Vega.
The Vice-President recognized that the Council 'the report was coveted to the Zapater Government outside the game' and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De Vega emphasized that Spain has no repairs to the intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They are just wanted to be informed" to avoid being "avened," reports Aguirre in a cable.
He also pointed out that the employer of Exteriores, Miguel Ángel Mortinos, as the Spanish executive "I would like to give this case the lower profile possible, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited influence capacity. "
By its part, in January 2007, Vicente González fiscal delivered the Ambassade that he would not try to block the initiative of the judge to request the declaration of the documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"Their reports contain no incrimination or any sensitive information," the Embassy explained after speaking with the tax.
However, the EEUU reflected its concern for the " apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German fiscals," more than for the declared information of the NCC or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will combine our efforts to manage the case discreetly between Governments," ladies Aguirre.
In March 2007, in a dinner between the EEUU and the Minister of Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although the Spanish judges are rarely ceasant of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he gave instructions to his fellows "for avoiding comments of retomated inflation, in an attempt to turn the temperature".
The embarrager also expresses its concern for the action of the PP in this matter.
"Requests its pro-American general guidance, our experience suggests that the PP will not undertake any indication that the Government of Zapater had tolerated or deliberately ignored EU actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the EU Government."

Populars would gain 4 flights in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lorena, Tarragon and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and deputates experienced in the recent autonomical elections, the Catholic PP has already viewed the generals, therefore, there is more or no, the perspectives are more positive than the number of votes that this training receives in these very double comites that it receives in the Catalans.
The Catholic populations therefore obtained 610.473 votes in the 2008 Generals, while in the 2006 Autonomics, the number reached to 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC has achieved 384.091 votes.
To maintain this trend at the top, which has been devoted from a vote transfer of the PSC and the reliability of the electoral of the PPP, the analysis of this training calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could pass from 8 to 12 deputy members in the Congress, while CiU would also win four (here has 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less than 9 deputates (see 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan plate is essential for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the populars, ERC would lose a deputy - now he has three - while ICV would stay with a deputy or gain one.
But to maintain the electoral calendar, the most immediate quota will be produced in May 2011 with the municipal commissions, where populars can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and on the basis of the Barcelone Division, one of the administrations that are more mainstreaming - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
As well as popular nationalists, it is possible that the PSC affects the advertisements of Barcelona, Tarragona, Large and Gerona, where socialists would not receive majority or opportunity to recurre to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Since the republic decade, this training would not be dismissed that its representation in the Barcelone Council - it is necessary to get 5 per cent of the votes - .
The PP has increased its vote number in the four capitals and could be a decision-making force in Barcelona, Large and Tarragon.
Nationalists are agreed to protagonize the ransom in the Taraconian capital, where they governed with the PP before the current socialist alcalde, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Brussels, the PP was just 500 votes from the PSC, whose alcalde, Angel Ros, maintained very good relationships with Mariano Rajoy during this last campaign, was found in several times.
People have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Cataluña and encourages to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passengers to Al Qaida
Besides the seven arrested in Barcelona, three were in Thailand
The seven Paquistanians and the Nigerian officers of the Police Information Commission in Barcelona formed an allehidrate cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passengers to different groups of Al Qaida, including "The Tigres for the Liberation of Earth Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), author of Bombaya, who caused death to 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, until the point of ensure that the 'Kampai operation' has remained "disabled" the El Qaida falseization device at international level and, of course, its operational capacity.
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years active in Cataluña, has been able to send thousands of passengers to Thailand, where they were falseized and then distributed to the criminal groups of Al Qaida, so that their "combaters" could cross the European borders and other Western countries in full impunity.
The distant cell is not the only one that the has been operating network in Europe, so that in investigations have participated, notwithstanding the Tailand Services, other European police units, so it is not denied that the EU territory has been carried out in the next days similar attacks to the development of the last Saturday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation, the Chinaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Siticahar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigeriian Babatude Agunbiade, was developed in Thailand with the capture of the Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Sirikanlaya Kijbung.
These were those from Bangkok the cell in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan Network - part of it was struck in 2009 - mainly robbed passport tourists that comply with the requirements marked by the "Islamic World France".
The documents should be named men between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without stamped visa.
In the middle of the investigation, it is underlined that at the moment no date was found to bind the arrested in Cataluña with the Bombay attraction, although the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", was one of the receipt groups of the rocked passengers in Spain and then falsely in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before it was committed from Cataluña, some thousands of dollars were sent through a transfer agency that were "inverted" in the buy of mobile cards, which were then used by the integrators of the "coming" who ended with life of 106 people.
Police has been undertaken by a abundant documentation.
The PP requires Mas to approve the fiscal agreement
The leader of the PPC, Alice Sánchez-Kamacho, had an opportunity at yesterday to submit to Artur Mas its conditions to support its investment as the President of the Generalitat, the identificing of the already planned during the campaign and to give priority to the recovery of the economy and to the pressing of filo-soberanist adventures, as is the economic consequent that the national leader wants to plan at the expert of its mandate.
The Chairman of the Catholic People's meeting of Artur Mas with the security that had received 18 deputys in the last Sunday elections, more than enough to make it possible, since the candidate of the CU needs at least one of the trainings that the opposition will take place in the investment vote.
It is possible that the PP depends on the future alliances that nationals want to keep at the Congress when general elections are held, but at the moment, the discussions that these days hold Mas with the rest of political leaders are made in the Catalan key.
And with regard to the President of the PP, to support an investment, "he must spend all the sovereign and independent talks," as well as the economic concert - similar to the Country - which the Convergence leader is intended even to submit referendum.
Both leaders are commonly intended to adapt the political device of a very inflated autonomic administration and the elimination of the tax of success and donations.
The details on the Mas investment will be taken by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
It has already been meetings with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and will today make it with Joan Puigcercos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laport (Solidaritat Catalana).
The retroatric claims that deaths were not "intensive measures"
The owners of the center of Olot are not denied to kill more than 11 elders.
The leaders of the La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press race to reduce the damage that caused him to the institution of the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the sister who was there, while he killed at least one eleven eleven elders who had his charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, compared with the letter of the center, the Advocate Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be able to execute accused against the license" of death but "the legality and the responsibility of the processal situation of civil liabilities".
In addition to the social disappearances that can suffer the entity because it has not been identified at time by the criminal activities of the Craftor, the great threat for the Caritat now covers the form of sustainable compensation that are already calculating the legal representatives of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime was returned to August 2009 and that since then he had not left to kill.
The judge already pointed out in the car which ordered the exhumation of eight bodys - old patients in the backatric - which suspected that in many cases, no doctor had personally investigated the faults but, waiting for the age and patologies of patients, he was disappeared by telephone.
The Caritat, through his director, refused this extremely dismissed yesterday and emphasized that "the lack of measures could not be at any time the cause of what happened."
The La Caritat lawyer added that " in the cause there is no one indication that it had been an imprisoned action by any other person who is not the own person".
He already baptized as "Anggel of the Mournal" assigned before 11 murderers and detailed that the first crime had committed it on August 29, 2009 for a month and half later, to kill a second grandfather.
In this case, death was provocing him with an insuline overdosis, except for the first crime that had committed it by helping a mixture of settled pastles.
The La Caritat director points out that it is complicated to control that the center’s staff has access to medicines.
Insulin paints and seducing code would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the hospital, in their Afhan, had been used to eliminate the suffering of the internals, used to give them death.
But the analysis are done in the laboratory which should explain whether Vila was not missing and was seeking for their first victims a less cruel death or if, otherwise, he broke them through the daddles, as he had already confessed that he did with the three women who killed between 12 and 17 October.
The Caritat does not give confidence to the manifestations of the slaughter, nor even to the number of confided murderers, which do not deniate that it is higher, and justify their attitude in the various versions he has given Vila in their visits to the judge and in the little sense that he must change its way to proceed after he has done, with successful eight murderers.
That is why they say that justice is available to call the scope of this success.
ECB threat
Insurers reacted brushly yesterday at the Trichet threat yesterday that warned "the markets must not underestimate our reaction capacity".
The disparities of the enterprises have closed with force and the actions of the European banks have risen more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the ECB's capacity to be mistaked, and the euro has not yet reacted what is an interesting sign.
What has been produced yesterday is propriety of a illegal market that is likely to be recovered but motivated by closing short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will end to lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB cited us today to take liquidity measures and must be retracted tomorrow in two years and those remaining.
The Federal Bank required the finalization of the public purchase plan for ineffectiveness and elimination of all extraordinary measures of liquidation at a time and left only unlimited access to weekly.
After the Irish crisis, we hope to extend current liquidization measures "after March" and keep the quarterly subsistence with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they continue with your good buy program and even give the sign to intensify it.
If you do not satisfy the generated expectations will return the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if you are still obliged to take liquidity measures, God asks us!
As at its May meeting, they said that they didn't have seen the purchase of goods and have paid the markets tomorrow could be repeated.
The ECB must be confident and constant.
In May the bacteria announced the moon and the middle stated that he had already buyed a lot, provocating a new deployment of the market.
Tomorrow the subsaster of letters to one year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Tesor has only emitted 500 million to 5,28%, 750 million to 4,81% of the previous subsistence.
The types in Portugal were still 30 basic points around the curve, clearly reflecting the change of market feelings after Trichet' words.
In Ireland, the figures of Allied and the Bank of Ireland have been published.
The estimated numbers are approximately 10,000 to short term and other 15.000 potentials and have to get private capital or will remain nationalized.
While Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are asumable within the Help Plan and are helping reducing uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday next, the Government will have to obtain the Parliamentary adoption of its new budget and still has no sufficient support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tonn of his talk to refer to the next Summit of State and Government Chiefs on 14 December, in which a political commitment is required that we are a unit and that we all touch the same party.
The problem is that Germany wants to touch Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the Chairman had the opportunity by presenting the plan of action on Thursday to adopt the Council of Ministers.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonom communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment are in the ears of investors such as Vivaldi's four stations.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that Spanish Bolsa has increased 4,5 per cent, the twoth as the remaining European Bolsas.
At the difference of February, the reaction of the Government and the Spain Bank has been rapidly and concurring and we have benefited of the surprise effect.
Today there is a key substance of a good to three years that will be benefited by Trichet effect so that we hope that it will be resumed with strong demand and help to disappear doubts about our refinance capacity.
Spain would be a self-inflammation for a Help Plan.
We would give us a liquid line that we don't need, the Tesoro has more than 40,000 in liquidity available the triple that is in March, to sweet types and close access to the undangered markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be the César's wife, "forgiving it, it seems to be."
Anonymo, we can.
The President of Eulen will impose the Vega Sicily meeting requested for her children
The time is not loved in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebra.
David Álvarez, a group funder, will impose, when considering it "night of full law", the Judicial Meeting of the next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to deal with the Bodegas Vega Sicilia's title bodies.
David Alvarez and his sons, Jesus David and Mary Joseph, are for the legal battle for the new court chapter in his lity by the control of the group.
The company's highest business service holder is not intended to move on its license to be present in the Enebro government bodies.
His administration advice was discharged by five of its seven children who were appointed administrators at the 18th January of the 18th year, and whose impunity is noted in the Mercantil Registre.
The Judicial Meeting of El Enebra for the next day 16, called by the judge of the Mercantil number 2 of Madrid, has re-opened the board of the Álvarez family.
The proceedings to the judge to fix the meeting is, until the conflict was resolved, the only legal mechanism guaranteeing the convocation of the meeting.
The last movement of John Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez as a "desperated remedie of his five children to, by processal argument, in a clear violation of law and abuse of law, to verify and heal the radically nucleal council of 18 January," according to its official portfolios.
This argument will be the basis for, once the meeting held, proceeds to its impunity by considering that it is "note of full law".
The same protagonists, who hold a silence discretion, have already tried to convene a meeting in June.
In the Enembra, heritage and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among others, are seven children of David's Álvarez controling 100 per cent of the capital.
However, the funder of the Service Group requires the use of 51% of the capital, according to the family protocols.
This is the question of the fund that the judge should decide once the view on the demand of impunitation is held, for which no date is not yet mentioned.
Red Bull triunfa in F1 with a secret arm of Siemens
A software designs better in real time cars.
Since the Red Bull override in the world of the Forum 1 in 2004, his history in this universe of speed selection has been marked by the surprise and success.
At the first time no one took into consideration the options of a reciprocal scudion and, despite the upcoming trajector of the last time, last November, at the final recital of the campeonate all turned on the triunf of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without to dismiss the capacity as a pilot of the campaign finally, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the capacity of the Renault motor that promoting its car, in the world of the Formula 1 has become a license of the "sird arm" that the Multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to become it into a winner team.
It is actually a powerful symptoming software that German has put on the market in 2007, with very deep-scale purposes of high self-mobilistic competition.
Named PLM, this powerful informatic tool has been used to design produced furniture lines around the world, energy plants, high precise tools.
The goal is to play, simulate faithfully the product or the process before creating it in real manner, avoiding this fair and avoidable expenditure.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's photography cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nessan's most useful cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this informal instrument in its factory of Formula 1 has allowed the Red Bull to design and take effect "in a few hours, almost in real time," changes, changes and improvements that are detected during the roads and tests.
Russwurm explains that the pillars in 1992 had a average of 10 technicians in its team that were able to introduce maximum of three or four improvements in the vehicles every time.
In the Network Bull team today, 180 high-qualification professionals are working with powerful informal teams, analyzing and projecting all luck of amendments in the bullets.
The Siemens' directive explained that the PLM software could analyze and improve all the elements of the network Bull's brackets, except the engine, which is the entire responsibilities of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and security elements are amended.
Changes can be brought from the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced production systems through high technology laser and autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this lower of the technological improvement is the number of $40 million that each team of Formula 1 can be paid as a maximum in each time to facilitate competition.
Network Bull has mounted high technology manufacture to design and produce its balls in a locality at about 50 kilometers of London.
It is two buildings in which visits are restricted, especially for periodists.
Everything that happens there is considered "the highest secret".
The model for this compilation is 580 people, including their two pilots, the Vettel and Mark Webber campaign.
The heroe of the Forum 1 of Red Bull, uncertainly, is the recent Sebastian Vetell campaign.
The large technical resources that the mark of energy drinking has been made to the service of their participation in the circuits, other protagonists whose concours is inestiably fair and their nucleus notory.
Steve Nevey technicians said that five years ago, it was possible to confirm that I+D advances in car car car cars were 50% of victories and pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and the technological amount of 85 per cent of success, while pilots are 15 per cent of the added value.
Nevey recognizes that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the informatics because "related glads are."
HP will install in two years of 20 own tents with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated yesterday in Barcelona his first exclusive table in cooperation is its Pont Reyes partner.
This will be the first of the 20 trade network between 80 and 100 square metres, which the multinational was intended to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will compatible this initiative with 16 areas already present in multimarca centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and the English Court.
The Vice-President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, made an example of the removal tent located in the Great Barcelone Vía, property of Pont Reyes, which collaborates for 30 years ago.
The North American Group has prepared a plan to place 200 brand points in Europe in 2013, a strategy including the 20 Spanish institutions.
The first opening was Bucarest (Romania) and Belgrado (Serbia) last week, as Barcelona the third.
Mr. I didn't want to develop the following possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the following destination.
The HP personal system director also assured that the philosophy for installing tents would always be the same, supporting a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The north American group advises and is undertaken by the exclusive mobile design of tents (with interactive products that can be touched), which will have an ideal image in Europe.
Furthermore, HP covers the training of the staff of the institutions.
Helena Herrer refused that it was a franquity system and stressed that the exclusive trade network intends to "to improve customer service and pimmes in the purchase, care, powder and even embalk."
Barcelona's team includes a space with a global pioneer pilot program that is responsible for solving the possible possible problems of HP information teams in guarantee.
A online service connected to a technical centre located in Maastricht (Holand).
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that may sometimes spend up to two days."
"This system is particularly designed for pyms and users, since large enterprises already have technical assistance services", he noted yesterday Helena Herrero.
Saadell offers a million clients to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directives, the Delegated Council of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a hard year for the bank, but initially leave a new liquidity and vatican crisis at the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, there is a deployment of interest margins, which will be tried to compensate partly with commissions and credit prices.
Saadell is waiting for capture in three years a million of particular customers, their dependent allocation.
Sabadell has found a way to explore the next three years and power so survive in a very complex economic environment.
The bank will take a new director plan in 2011, which will have a victory of three years.
In addition to survive without need to recurre to public aids from the FROB, it is to gain a market share with the caption of a million new customers -700,000 if they have been discovered that can go out of the bank, its largely dependent allocation, as it has been mixed more than the pimmes and companies than the minorist client.
This year has taken 250,000 particular customers and 50,000 enterprises.
In particular, its market share is 3,5 per cent, while in companies are over 10 per cent.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity proposed, or the same is austerity, with cost reduction as a objective, and whose challenges will represent the bank when the results of the year are present.
A few banks are attempted in these times to establish a number of public objectives and goals, since the financial crisis has overall plans of the World Bank.
Saadell will actually close its Optim Governor Plan for four years ago, even though it was initially for three, but the market situation made that it would extend more performance.
The customers who leave to escape the cards will be their main goal.
In a disagreement organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 will be a "ficil and transcendental year".
In fact, the executive believes that the outcome of the crisis in Spain will be slow.
Furthermore, in two or three years, it will be "Much difficult to create job", something fundamental for the survival of bank business, stressed.
And even though it is believed that the passive war - which penals the margins - is reduced, the price of the risk prices that are paying banks and cuttings for their emissions to obtain liquidity is already transferred to the credit price to compensate the harvest.
"Theme of liquidity and financing is structural, and will be a credit pressure factor."
"We didn't close the griff, but the differences are higher," Guardiola recognized.
Bank has already commanded Thursdays to their network to limit the long-term credit and to highlight the price of the differences - see Cincodaia of 22 and 27 November -.
He also recognized that the trend of the bank now "there to go on commissions", but "they have a competitive framework."
The Saadell ' s director plan is based on organic growth, even though, as always, the group does not discharge corporate operations.
No, and we doubt, ensure that in Spain "see you want to receive greater sizes."
"The year coming is going to move everything," he assured.
He states that capital needs are "subjected" and not denied that some Spanish financial entity between red numbers.
And he pointed out that the FROB can comply on the market in the caption of funds before new recapitalizations.
In order to ensure that Saadell can survive the timely closure of the markets, it remained important to what some bankers are already alive as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it can't be emitted, but in contrast to what happened in June, it can be obtained short-term financing through rest, which loves the crisis.
The CECA defers a second olive of fusions in the boards
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrita, decreed yesterday that it would be going to produce an oil of housing chains and again stressed the speed that the sector is implemented by restructuring.
When the concentration process of the Spanish cards, several entities ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Ahorros (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that this new oil of operations would be produced.
"I think the largest part of the fusions has been done, the integration of Cajasol to the Civic Bank Group cannot be said that it is a second round, what is correct."
"The majority is completely done; it may be that we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been made and protected by the Spanish Bank, which has also been much collaborated," the Directive pointed.
In declarations during a decade of the Aragon Guidelines and Executive Association (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process is being "for more possible speed, and we must be very satisfied about how it is being produced in the terms that are not now marked in the negotiations plans with the Spain Bank", he has entitled.
"Back from 45 cases with a average of 28,5 million assets to 17 with 75,5 million is a process that has no paragon in the history, reducing the number of entities at 62% in order to be much larger to meet Basel," he aligned.
Olavarrieta recognized that "a series of views are quite unfortunate about the density of the process" showing "a lack of series and sense," because "the fact that does the Spain Bank is to remember that we must be within the period before the end of year."
The Director-General of the CECA José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system of all Europe and "probably" of the world, and granted those who put it into judgment a "stuff of knowledge".
The Directive pointed out that, within the current economic coycling, "we can be very quiet" with the situation of the financial entities and the cold chains, a system which has launched a "interim concentration" process and that "a greater speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank was very well closed from the ECB tests made in July.
Zapater and German red line
Berlín has opted to keep in the euro, but has established the conditions for all the Union.
Market tensions have caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapater has advanced new adjustment measures, from fiscal reductions to pyms, regulation of private postage or removal of the 426 euros of aid without delivery, until 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and the control of the State airports and 30%.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of the Vice-President Philipe González, added the criticians to the Angela Merkel cancer for its responsibility to disappear the current crisis.
How do we interpret these movements?
Go before Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the other hand, it is another turn of tour in the difficult refining process of the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what must be its future, which has to keep the former traditions of the good part of its partners.
Besides European resistences, Germany begins to speculate the three possible outcomes to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by her own, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would leave the monetary area.
The second, the recovery of the framework, even though it now appears fitting science, with a very favourable view course, is approximately 50% of the population.
The third, a remuneration of the euro, in line with the German proposals of greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigorage, many of the transitional countries, possible suspension of payment of one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it comes to be defined since a time ago, so there are no excuses now.
First, in 2009, when both the IF and the European Commission stimulated the deficits, the German Government was laid out a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first divergence sign between Germany believed that it should be done (budgetary and stability plans in public finances), and what they were practicing their European partners, including France.
The second in the face of the God the central European country, when Merkel penally expanded the decision of salvation from Greece.
But the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the public were very contrary to the residues of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel is reiterated with a clear position, requiring the reform of the Union's treaties, to make a country saving possible and, at the same time, obligation to private providers to run through the cost.
This position has been interpreted as an anti-European, since the Irish crisis and all the other.
But its proposal, although so much education has been adopted and, in the next months, we should assist the Union reform process that can take these measures from 2013.
Germany has brought a red line that does not think to cross.
And it is saying to us to all that, though now it should take steps with which it may not be very agreed, from that date, the ancient operation of the euro will be completed.
The 2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, where infractor countries will be severely sanctified, may be bound to stop payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run through the cost.
Germany emphasises that we should continue a serious growth path with high rise rates and investment, moderate consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external salary.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge guns in the payment balance, such as the Spanish growth in the years of the tree, will not only be tolerated.
The invitation is clear.
And we wouldn't understand it.
It is not only to reduce public deficit in 2013 to 3%.
What they demand us is much more hard.
And the worse in these circumstances we could do is to stumble ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences leave a more quiet.
And that we're making the window of opportunities that they gave us until the spring of 2013.
It seems that the President Zapater has also understood it and its double manifest (the reforms promised after the past Saturday meeting with the large enterprises and the advertisement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticians to Merkel, the way that the tess needs to be ordered home.
But the red line which Germany has brought there is, and it doesn't seem to move her.
And, among the possibilities that are expected, to leave a too serious monetary area from little serious countries, it cannot be excluded.
Then, Germany can always tell us that he has already advertised us.
Sports and drugs
Treats like Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax show engine but not wish to escape a santion.
The early urging outcome by two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game discussed on 23 November against Ajax in the Camperons Liga has caused the writing of a river on whether such behaviour is or not anti-deportable and, eventually, both players should be sanctified by UEFA.
As it is well known, notwithstanding a few minutes to end the game (when his team had already been clearly winned), the two players had been deliberately lost time at the time of get out of messengers to provocate the paradise to show them the second amarilla card.
Thus, and since the Real Madrid will end as leader of its group, both players will fulfil the next legal sanction of the league, against the Auxerre, and can pass clean cards at the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctified two parties to the team driver, José Mourinho, and with various economic amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a bitter card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but more frequently in the world of the flutbol.
It is so extended as part of the etotes, not written rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the reported debate should be protagoned by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in his presum of nobleness and honor, and that in past occasions he has multiplied its players by analogic acts) and the ocean dramatization, seems to be, by Mourinho, which adds more a episodio to his speech of historical and provocative history.
In any case, the debate turns on whether this type of behaviour is not explicitly prohibited by the regulation contrary to the principles of the sport, i.e. if these actions are acted against law; in fact, they are acts respectable with the sport regulation, but they seem to have their sense.
The question is to consider the type of damage caused by the sports spirit.
One of the goods that understand the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, the aspect that these actions have not been in danger, i.e. there was no violent game.
Another of these goods that are linked with clean game is to avoid that the team of infractor players is injustice with the other equipment, which has not happened.
However, the paradise of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it was not satisfied to what we normally characterize as a trap or a law-fraud, since its violation of the rules was not hidden to avoid sanctions, but that its action exactly tried to be the most clearest to the punishment of the Arbitre.
They waited and accepted sanctuary.
Another question is what kind of advantage receives infractors in the lack of intentions considered.
Here it seems to be necessary to be noted that the rival is not placed in a situation that is not in the same party, because the result of the action is clearly allowed to leave the own team with less players.
And it is not also an useful strategy for the next game, because the club cannot count with these players.
The advantage, of course, is that the players will start the next phase of the Camperons Liga without cards that can threaten their participation in a future party.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain level of indetermination, because the team can be removed by the first change, and also by this action, the players comply with a sanitation party and pass to the second card cycle, where the suspension by accumulation of cards is produced with one less than in the first cycle.
In order to go around, it's not so clear that it's a advantage.
Finally, these actions are not against the sports spirit, which are partly to take strategic decisions that encourage the highest proved of what they allow the rules.
Of course, the players did not act to evadere the application of sanctions (these would be a clear case of law-fraud), but that they were more elected when they were subject to it.
They took a strategic decision without sorting punishment or escape from the same.
Although the border between engine and law fraude is disappointed, I think in this occasion it was a clear case of engine.
Polymic seems to me to rise by two factors: because it was two self-exhibitions and how the direction has been carried out.
The damage caused to the principles of sports for these actions is not as ethical as an ethical.
Offers for capture of groups' shipping dinners in BCN
The calendar declaration has focused on a reservation rate for 16 and 17 days.
They are prolifering self-employed meetings by employees, who want to feed between 20 and 30 euros.
As the tournament and the lotery, with the arrival of December, also the groupal dinners before the Christmas, who continue to execute oxygen ballon for restoration and ocean of Barcelona, but that because of the crisis, they have deployed a correct price offence to capture the major client: almost all want to feed between 20 and 30 euros in dinner or food, the enterprises and associations of the sector.
To complete the compliance of the accountability, the calendar of this year (the Nochevija in Western) has concentrated the requests in the week of 13 December, with the result to the date of a dinner reserve for days (the 16 and 17) and the movement for the previous week.
As it has already been since 2008, when the stage of flash vacances began, many companies who have removed collective dinners for the budgetary matter.
To not prejudice the tradition, many workers keep it paying their own cup.
Whatever the coycling, each and other require battle prices, confirms the President of the Repatriated Group of Barcelona, Gazze Farrás.
The representative of the patronal, at this time, is not urged to vaticians how the festivals of this month will be.
"The people think it so much before booking."
"He wants to go but has the warnings burned on the prices" points.
The business will go well "to those who give quality to a good price and with a good service," adds, and remember that customers have to draw up a scene with the crisis, so that the breast is turned to 25 euros in majority.
In a dream in various central institutions, the 17-year-old of requests is found.
The Sother Group indicates that there is a real boom of requests for that Friday, with the pretension of expenses less than 30 euros, which have responded by adapting their menus to the coysidy, with comprehensive forms of 25 to 35 euros.
In others of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 buildings in the city (Hostal of Rita, Market, the Fund and others), the calendar diversity has made more anticipated reservation, including from the beginning of November.
"We did the impossible to keep the same prices in the past year, with the menus for all guests from 19.95 to 30 euros," detail.
In the AN Group, which adheres El Mussol, Attic, Qu, and up to a total of 23 locals, are keeping optimists after identifying a growth of the facturation from the second half and some good, even though concentrated, business perspectives for Christmas.
The sources of the group stress that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of friends that precise feasts.
To its six group menus, a ship was added, with 30 euros or more as a star budget, and the perception that 10 per cent of the past year has been required for more details, as a box.
There are also green broets in some companies who return to invite their employees and feel that the volume of groups is something greater.
By the patronal Fecasarm (including entities such as the Bares Association, Restaurants and Ocio of Barcelona), his Vice-President, Enrico Goma, trusted to start seeing the end of the tunnel and sustained that the reservations are "animated" while clients "negoziate to the maximum".
Thus, the illusion by the festivals hasn't descended, pays who pays, indicates.
The Nuclear Programme of Paquistani generates great concerns in the EU
Islambad produces atomic weapons to "a faster ritmo than any other country".
Wikileaks' filters confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondance between the United States embraced in Pakistan and the EEUU State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portfolio confirms the huge concerns caused in Washington by the Pakistan Nuclear Programme.
On the margin of detailed slaughters and players offering the content of the discussions and thoughts of the North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islambad, documents show that cooperation between both countries in the atmosphere security, instead of growing, "decreased", and that the instability Asian country produces nuclear weapons "a faster ritm than any other country of the world".
The particularity of the Nuclear Programme - that weapons are not assembled, but that they remain stored by components to difficult their destruction in case of attack-- is one of the main reasons for development in Washington.
This also includes the emblemmate in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a previous report to the visit of the national security adviser, James Jones: "The neighbourhood of some nuclear installations under Taliban attack, the rumorized dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and the mixture programmes is already considered, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as proliferating and reason for keeping the watch.
“Pakistan has had to share personally with strict religious credibility to protect nuclear installations; as a result of the damage of educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recall people working in nuclear or misile programmes," said the expert Yuri Corolev, the Ministry of Russian Externals, at a meeting with their United States homologs.
The newest of the documentation filtered by the portal of Julian Assange is the always smaller cooperation between the EU and the Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high path of nuclear weapons production.
A delay of the embedded in May, which calculates by "favoring" communication with Pakistan, says: "Transparence is often unexisted; help offerings remain without response or are dismissed."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons to a faster ritmo than any other country in the world."
The emblemmate Patterson also requests Washington during a visitor of the Army Head of Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to say "Much clear" to the responsibility that "the Army of Pakistan must end with support to terrorist groups."
At the case of the Chief Wikileaks
He calls on a high liability of anti-terrorist fight to avoid new filterings.
Interpol emits a red warning to follow movements and place Assange where he is.
All relating to Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, forms a complex laberinto where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Warer Interpol delivered a "road aircraft" to "localize and follow Assange's movements.
However, it is not a traditional arrest order.
Furthermore, it is not new, but only date of 20 November.
And it must not be necessary to see with the last filtering of more than a million diplomatic documents in the EU, but with the accused of sexual abuse which Australian faces in Sweden.
Furthermore, the lawyer of the Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, ensure that "the police knows where and how to contact Mr Assange."
It was the 20th day when the international police body sat down in Lyon (France) said the order to request Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday after the authorisation of the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol have indications to identify or place Assange "in views of their provisional and extradition."
Although the Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person affected by a red warning, many of the Member States, as explained by the organization, are considered the noticed network move to take place to a arrest -- which must cut the national police body-, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where it is believed that it is Assange.
The movement has noted Assange lawyers that yesterday have published a letter by declared that the founder of Wikileaks, 39 years old, has been prepared to respond by video conference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also remember that Assange requested and obtained permission to go out of Sweden from the tax of his case, compared with the Minist Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Chief of Stalin Security.
"It seems to be a penalty, not a legal persecution," states the mission.
While the world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother defends his son-- Assange remains unrecognized, but not calling.
The Monday granted a interview to the director of the revised Time through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the discipline of the EEUU State Secretariat, Hillary Clinton.
"If it is possible to show that it was responsible for ordering United States diplomatics in the United Nations by violating international treaties that EEUU has signed, it should be dismissed," said.
His view was noted yesterday by the Press secretariat of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who calmed the request of the discipline.
"I am not all sure why we should import the opinion of a type with a web page," said the CNN chain.
The own Obama has been responsible for a high liable anti-terrorist fight, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document flights.
The attempt of the portfolio of President Barack Obama to resume the importance of Assange is contrary to views that these days are political and conservators.
Peter King, the Congressist who will preside the National Security Committee at the Lower Chamber, has requested the Department of State to consider the possibility of include in the list of terrorist organizations " to intervene and its funds and to pursue any of them of any contribution or aid."
More far still went Tom Flanagan, a consultant of the Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to be retracted after saying that Assange should be killed.
"Obama should turn it in goal and use a non-third aircraft or something."
Whoever has not been excused was Mike Huckabee, the Baptist Minister, the former manager of Arkansas and possible candidate to the presidency.
"Whoever in the Government who filtered the information is guilty of transmission and any thing that does not be the execution would be a too nice punishment," said the Fox chain.
Puigcercos search for peace in ERC with tickets for Carod's purposes
The Chief of the Republic will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet offers a more multiple execution and the end of the assemblement system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the receipt to sort the internal revealed enemy in the ERC boards, without north for the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The Chairman of the Party is aware that his dismission love is insufficient for the purposes of the exhibition of Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but also knows that the influence of this sector is so disappointed as its own mentor and that it is absolutely able to cause the head browsers that had with other extreme corrigers.
Therefore, the leader of Escherra will try to gain the new criticals with dogs that allow you to blind to the municipal elections.
To begin, Pugcercos announced yesterday that the more than 200 national advisers of ERC can be proclaimed on their continuity in secret.
Withdrawal papers, and not with a high hand.
If the carodists want some sentence of punishment to the President, they may be able to do so without fear to represidents.
In fact, the pillar head wants to avoid the discipline image as well as the submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that more than one of the votes would not be ratified, but he added, without specification of percentages, that it would not be a good result "a blue".
The next in Carod requires the President any more than putting its charge to the war, a manager that does not fit when Puigcherchos controls the maximum body between congress.
But if you don't have the most enough to force dismissions, you'll try to agree with the executive a road sheet from here to May.
To that end, they are expected to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the direction will submit to the vote of the National Council on the 18th day.
Their intention is to advise Pugcercos in a change that this promise adds the Congress to October 2011, something that is already the public.
The leader of ERC recognized that the “polifoneia” threatens stability and that its goal is to make, once again, the organization is able to lay down the doors from inside.
In this line, the article was symptomically signed by Josep Huguet in his blog.
In view of the idea of Pugcercos, the holder of Innovated gave that the leader will be renewed "to change of various objectives".
And he entitled five, of those two.
The first, "recomposer" is the executive to represent at least 90% of the war, i.e., include new faces from the Afghan sector in Carod.
The second can be the great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC shall be liquided once the assemblement as a operational mechanism.
Thus, it offers a reform of the status that allows the congress to celebrate through delegations elected by subfragio.
Along with the assembled model, a exception in the Spanish game system, has been an obsessing of the Pugcercos team, which already fighted in this sense at the last two congress.
In fact, the Consumer Convulsion of 2008 left the direction to revise the Assembly in a specific reform congress.
This citation remains dependent, since the internal sea in the past years was disagreement of the matter.
Now, without critical sectors at the ocean, can be a good time to retain it and try to close it forever.

Manage China objectives to reduce winter gas effects
The representative of that country in the COP16 assured that its country had made huge efforts to reduce the carbon gap and detailed its offer of reduction for 2020 between 40 and 45 per cent of its gas emission of winter effects.
China maintains its offer of reducing 40 to 45 percent of its emission of winter gas emission to 2020, ensured his Wei, representative of that country to the COP16.
At its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the United Nations Market Convention on COP16, his Law ensured that its country has made great efforts to reduce carbon wheel and to restore its industry.
In fact, in the past four years, their country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce the emission of inner gas effects.
However, he made clear that China would not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in that matter.
He reaffirmed that Chinese climate change strategy is divided in four rubles: dialogue; capacity-building; building institutions and supporting pilot programmes.
All these rubbers have been progressed, including the approval, the past year, of a new Energy Law, which collects the objectives planned in relation to gas reduction, explicitly.
On the other hand, he noted that in China, federal authorities have been working in coordination with the states and the local authorities in order to achieve the objectives of energy supply, effective energy use and reduction of emissions.
Furthermore, they have been running or have already concluded various multi-annual plans, which are funded by the Chinese government, as well as by the Governments of other countries.

Appearance to the legality of the Espine Exhibition: César Nava
The National Guideline of the PAN reported that the former Panist leader is in his right to accuse the National Order Commission to recall what is agreed on its right.
The National Guideline of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to legality and that the former Panist leader is in his right to accuse the National Orden Commission to recall what it agrees to its right.
In prior to the Gabino Protestation Take Cué Monteagudo as State Governor, he said that Espino's expulsion is a decision taken in the local field.
"It is an autonom decision of the Commission of Orden de Sonra."
"Mr. Espino has its right to appeal, in his case, to call for the Commission of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," noted.
In addition, he explained that it is not time to think in 2012 and that it was never a partnership for the presidency candidate.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that national action would be strengthened from the internal election of the next 4 and 5 December, in which the successor should be elected.
"This (a partnership in 2012) is a subject that never was in the negotiation table at least at least now was a planning for the local election which was achieved and fulfilled the goal," he reaffirmed.
The Panist leader said that the PAN supported it 71 years of dialogue, so that "not fearing internal competition; the concept "we enjoy it and strengthen us," he added.

As a question of the criticians of the PRI to the President Phillipe Calderon for his discussion within the four years of his Government, César Nava called the princes to reflect the sixths of the former Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas of Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the Zedillo and Salinas Governments were better than Fox and Calderon; that they start to defend; that it goes out of the clothes," he confirmed.
He thought that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions as he did in his speaking at the National Auditor, because in the country there is no fault or much less censure.
Promote Obama in Twitter law for students in documentation
"If you agree to adopt Dream Act law is appropriate, calling your Senators and Instances to approve them is legislation," the statutory President in the popular social network.
The President Barack Obama has been joined today to national mobilization in support of Dream Act law, to legalize in documented students, with a message in your personal account of the Twitter social network.
"If you agree that adopting Dream Act law is the appropriate, calling your Senators and Instances to approve them is a law," did Obama.
His short message maintains a cibernetic link with a broader document that requests the public to be informed immediately with Senators, since the vote of legislation is imminent.
" With a vote expected to happen soon, now it's the time to make your voice listen," says.
The message was informed after 42 republics threatened by blocking the vote of any legislation, unless the extension of the taxes of the Bush war and the financing of the government is appropried.
This block, announced in a letter signed by the 42 republic Senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the block to the Dream Act law and other projects, the President-president Robert Gibbs trusted that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a calendar could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a long time..."
"We all agree in which we need to solve the fiscal case before the end of the year..."
"I think we can achieve an agreement at some time and then we can plan the follow-up," said he.
The leader of the democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced the march that he would ask a "power of debate" for the Dream Act, so that the initiative to legalize in documented students could be voted from the next Thursday in the Senate, even though it is more likely to be the next week.
The Senatoral version of the Dream Act or the Law of Sweden would justify about 800 thousand young people who entered into the United States before 16 years, remained in the country in the last five years and entered into a higher education institution or army.
However, the parties require 60 votes to approve the initiative, therefore, require the consequence of a republic pending, at the time that partidaries of the project protagone an intensively comprehensive organizations to ensure the adoption of the law.
Democrats, most of which support the Dream Act, contain 58 escapes.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson de Nebraska said that he will vote against, and only a republic has expressed its support to the law, Richard Location of Indiana.
Therefore, the Dream Act parties need to summ several republics in the case of other democrates to decide to give the initiative.
Among the most shortened republics are the Senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the Senator of George Lemieux, of Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other republics who supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, from Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have declared that they will not support it in another occasion.
Another republic who supported, John McCain, has not defined its position at this time.
Although the Chamber of Representatives has a different version, analysis agree that the Dream Act faces the most obstacles in the Senate.
With literature put the finger on the layer
The second round of the language placers was a step where participants made a gala of the narration
"These of the sex in the language understanding it, but...the back in the lague? What's it expected to me?" He asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of the language placers, which celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of his question (in another ferry the back table was sent to the sex in the language, explicitly).
The finger on the flagga... "These put us in appreciation," he sweetly hoped the Argentinan writer to the public, mostly of youths, which was set at the International Feria of the Library of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderate refund table by Marisol Shultz and where they participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramirez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that gave to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would define afterward as a great account, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who is looking for knowledge what is the "llaga", is a doctor who does not receive answers even though he pust in the same narrative goal.
From infectologus sales convinced: "The patience is not my strong, perhaps my flash."
Finally, after a disappointed approach with the traumatologe that has rolled him in half of the past, but who explains him that it is not a scientific term; it is the psychoанist who reveals the mystery: "The lague is the real open, the symbolic is the cicatriz".
The protagonist understood alliance and concluded "of the lame only so much to know that it's the real open and there's no", but it is convinced that the placers and the traps of the language must be very interviewed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nikaraguan Sergio Ramirez also exposed a delicate narration titled the Elogio of the invention, where the finger is not dark but in a moment it is discovered.
With magieous realistic pincels, account of a famous hechicer, which the same cloud touched, bringed back to men who had gone away or repaired the virtues that had lost a tiny, narration which had lived to speak then America, the great news to which they had not lacked from the principle of their own cronists that contained it and cited it to the Castle Day that criticals the expenditures of the account by the conquistants.
"Certains who discovered us all (the writers) made a bunch of the physical witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise it would never have come to tell the history of America with a imagination that he was missing until the skill."
However, he noticed "The places and the embussers that are best imagining" and it is where he converts reality and lies, where you don't know that it belongs to a band or another, where the fiction literature reaches its support.
Actually, it calls the "Grand Tradition".
"For her heritage we're what he's thinking."
At his turn, the writer Mayra Montero caught and spread the variety of interpretations to which he placed the invitation of the FIL with its back table The finger on the lake.
Cuban-Portourian has pointed its approach to the great extent of social violence that has been translated by its country - and the Latino American-product of trafficking and drug sales.
"I believe the good literature, the good poesia, good songs will have a tacit commitment that, of course, it is not premeditated," she said, after cited that the reality of the literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment set between authors and readers, and that in a "chimical reaction" of this last.
The night he closed it the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also made an exhibition "of that thumb in the clash of the bonded writer."
He thought that in a world that lives quiet, also in the intellectual coasts and controls of the consciences that turn into dogmatics, forgeting "the one behind each claim is a little non-and behind each negative is a small yes."
"To be owner of our thought and to be the owner of the reality we have to kill: and kill many times means put the finger on the lake and mourn to those people who are much more comfortable thinking in loading, white and black, in ideas established and without murder and painting also to the powers that prevent a world in white and black," said, invited to recover the sense of writing.
Roman goes through his first title
Rubén Omar Romano takes into account three delays in the end, has had highways on his road, but has already been aware of reaching the decisive series in three times.
With the dual of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, there are two different styles marked by their technicals that find one another with a marked contrast.
Rubén Omar Romano takes into account three delays in the end, has had highways on his road, but has already known to reach the decisive series in three times, although it has gone to white and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentinan has ended with the media of the subcampee, a step left behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consequences.
The Holy Strategy came to his first end in the Torneo opening 2002, when he was taking the sides of Morelia with which he fell on a global of 4-2 to Toluca; then, in the 2003 Clausura also had a decisive dual and also lost it with a global of 3-1 and was precisely before Raydos.
In 2010 with Santos Laguna, in the Bineo Bicenter Torneo, Rubén returned to suffer a reveal, since his team ended 2-2 before the choricers after 210 minutes of play, but in the pennaltis tank of 3-1 with two opportunities to swallow the title for finally three players had falled from the 11 steps and had suffered the 4-3 times.
Rubén has already lost two ends with the Red Diablos and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he doesn't want to correct the same luck, seek to disappear from malicious and can celebrate a title for the first time, although he states that the most important is the institution.
"I want to go out the campaign, I don't want to break any statistics, this is by a club, because of an appeal to which I have to and therefore it will come the title for my, but the former is the most important", said the fearer when he was questioned about the numbers he has against playing ends.
Most vigent has the previous end, of which, safely, has learned much, "the only teacher we can have is that until the silver arbitre can't celebrate, we are prepared in the raya, the players too, because the previous time, with two penals we have already been prepared to go out and I think that this is a teacher, until the game can't end."
Beware that this series could be defined in criminals, something that does not worry about him, because he trusted in his players: "Ano never seeks to reach the penal tank, one seeks to end in regular time, but sometimes there is no others and we should be prepared, in the previous tour we were prepared, unfortunately made us a bad destiny, sometimes by the nervous or concern to have the title in the hands, but it was us, that gave us something for this end that we hoped not to come to that institution."
Roman has in his hands to leave to be a technical sub-campon and to first prove the glory that gives the titles.
EU change rules for visa

From 10 January 2011, the proceedings of transmitting a visa in the United States and consulted States will be changed.
With the new procedure, most applicants must appeal to the Visa Service Service (ASC, by their English silks) before their interview in Consular Section.
The ASC staff shall take the biometrical information of the applicant, which is revised by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new proceedings will have certain advantages for the aspirators, including:
The total expenditure of the visa will be less, no longer needs to carry out a payment to concert the citate, another payment to process the visa application and another other to provide the reporting service.
The applicant shall only carry out a single payment that covers the three services.
The current rate will remain without change: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for cases with request (including temporary workers visa) and $390 for commercial and investment visas.
Persons who wish to renew their visa shall not be accompanied to an interview with the Consular Officier, but only attend the nearest ASC where they will submit their documents and take their flows.
Since the biometric information will be taken in the ASC, the applicants who need a second certificate to be reviewed in Consular Section will remain less than in the past.
Likewise, those in the consultations in the City of Juárez, Monterrey and New Laredo will no longer pay the extra service rate of 26 dollars.

NASA discovery of extraternal life will announce NASA
The United States Space Agency cited the press to present a finding that will affect the search for living in space.
The National Aviation Administration and Space (NASA) of the United States will give you to meet tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that it is an extraternal life.
The finding will be presented in a press road on Thursday at 13:00 at the NASA seat in Washington by experts in astrobiology, scientific science described as the shipment of origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the University.
In referring to the press, NASA assured that it would submit " a finding that would cause effects in the search for extraterrestress life", which submited experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures in our and in hostile environments that were thoughtless, and they would put on the table the possibility to be converted into understanding as humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It seems to be a microbio that was found on the foundation of Mono Lake in the National Park of Yosamite, California, where he lived in a environment that was too vital for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some way, creature uses arsenic as a way of surviving, and this capacity increases the possibility of similar life could exist in other plans that do not have our blessing atmosphere.
According to astrobiologs, if these agencies use arsenic in its metabolism, it will be shown that "There is another form of life, a second form of life, different than we know."
The Space Agency will know the true distance of the findings in the morning press conference.
The conference will participate in the geobóloga Pamela Conrad, who studies the opportunity of life in Marte; and the biologus Steven Benner, one of the scientists studenting Titán (the greatest moon of Saturno), under the perspective that his chemical is similar to the earth.
PRD, PT, Convergence and Block Pattern
With reforms to the Congress Act, they declares the "bipartment" array.
It wasn't installed the 60 Legislation when in the Congress a overseer block, undertaken by the Members of PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who was declared independent, and the four questioned something: the arrival of the "bipartitism" to the Chamber.
Before starting to installation of the 60 legislative meeting, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergence; Ezekiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrimon Montalvo, 'trayed' against the reform to the Orgánica Law, as it was excluded.
With this reform, they reiterated, starting to "biparty" because there will be two people, in the same number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Office of the Directive, undertaken by the Salvador López Britain and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo reported that this institutional reform is the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He stated that in the next days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scene, depending on a political will, and if they don't, then they will be re-alleged by both parties and that was completed by the opposite coalition.
"It has been here (the opositor coalition), it is what I look, because we are excluded from any decision, and have no political delay to consider the opinion of the rest."
Phillipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergence, said that with PRD, PT and Patrón, there are consents and therefore are compliance with a multi-group.
It can't be allowed, continued that the Congress after being monopolic is now "duoplic".
"It is not the spirit to reform the law that has an eternal bipatidism in the Congress."
In order to start, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking with other fellows and fellows to be more, satisfied convergent.
Ezekiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that the Congress currently becomes a 'botín' between two, in flaw to the PAN and PRI.
"Then was just a game, now they're divided between two."
Patrion Montalvo requested the personality of the Deputy, his place was given in the negotiations tables.
"There is not in the collective agreements, I will be left outside 5 that we will probably go to do 9 deputys, which we see, separately in different fractions, decided to unify us to find a place in the negotiation table, that is the subject that in the reform they agreed, we are out and we are not agreed with this reform."
Salt $200,000 more for "la supplier"
Paga Advertisement of Mazatlan's other Cheque to the electrical business career.
More than 200 thousand weights for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was sent by the accommodation.
With this, the amount paid in this second half to the properties of the electric material company is approximately 1 million 200 000 weights.
According to the Municin transparency page, the last cheque number 9258447 was issued on 16 November, for the amount of 200 000 144.56 weights, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts to pay."
The Tesor Luis Miguel López Moreno had advertised that more money would be from the Community for this provider, which was observed by the High Audit of the State to sell a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still added to it and therefore how much more the cheques are lacking for the benefit of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, you're just paying what the rest of the providers has to be paid," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reapered" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of October 15, 19, 29 of October and of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of State, as it marks the law when a company is questioned by the ASE, so that other Governments could not use their services, the Tesorer ensured that they have not returned to use their services.
The previous, after 25 July 2010, the Norwegian review published to the cheques that the advertisement had expensed to its providers, which revealed that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, the threeth of the Alcalde Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municigio paid more than 10 million weights through 42 cheques.
He also performed transactions with Jumapam, where he cut Cheques for over 3 million weights.
Requests to reach tourist sites
Foreign tourists, the accident of the foreign tourist is because of the bad conditions of the Gloriata Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a dog of the Sánchez Taboada Gloria, the Mazatlan tourist sector requested the authorities to give attention to the areas and places that are in bad state and to provide an evil image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Trade Association of the Dorada Zone, recalled that in different occasions they have declared the image of the destiny and returned the bad ones of the tourists with new activities or roads.
He said that the bad state of the streets and banks affected because the tourists are coming to pass and see the disorder and get back to near business.
"Politicals don't know what it is to close a day and have no idea of the diner that is asked, or otherwise they wouldn't do in this way work in so long and without the reasonable planning."
The José Ramón Manguart Sánchez hotel said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the accommodation.
"The municipality must assume its responsibility and avoid that it goes again, how then by giving preventive maintenance and not only to fall in the correct manner," he said.
"We are desired to enjoy a clean city, because not only for tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we have a clean place to live and the accommodation must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also light inconsistent and incomplete, said, like the Escudo and the Mazatlan Venatus.
"Today, in order to come the tourist is not only depending on the promotion, it must have a good product, a city that has cleanness in its plays, in their adventures, permanent maintaining the touristic attacks," said.
"It has not been given attention to the cause and this kind of fact puts in evidence something that is notion for all, maintenance does not fail."
Raúl Llera Martínez, subsecretary for Tourism Promotion, expressed that it is urgent rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan, as they are not used in a correct way and proceeding a bad image.
He said of a series of places that should be online together with the municipality and be priority to have the city daily, clean, ordered and attractive because it is a tourist vocation.
"Mazatlan offers many stories and cultural places that must first order, clean and put us online to be attractive to take them into the inventory we have to promote the destination."
Ask IP results to the Congress
Earlier Devalos, President of the CCE, proposed that the Members should be a great responsibility to be an example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it is.
A worth and free working law of agreements between parties and the State Executive is calling for the Mazatlan business sector, since there is a convulsioned Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday, 60 legislation, integrated by seven political forces, 19 PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alianza Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergence and one more of the PVEM, which takes a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new integrants of the State Congress is that a clean and commitment management with society and the various sectors that require a responsibilised legal work and that the same patrons of the Participation or paternalism are not repealed.
Earlier Devalos Zamora, President of the Council of Empresarial Coordinator, proposed that 40 expensive Members of the State Congress are the great responsibility of be a example of seeing a better Sinaloa for the various challenges that he has issued.
"We hope that the Members actually exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is costly that they make arrangements to ensure their own interests and become carnavals of the leaders and leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He thus said that they certified the commitment to establish the necessary pumps to go forward to the Governant.
"We are concerned that they are going to work worthy and mostly committed to society and sectors because they were the syntheses who gave them the confidence vote in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Hotels Association of Tres Islands, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to engage and take forces in search for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complex.
"The most important is that the economic growth, which generates incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will certainly foster jobs generation."
With regard to tourism activity, he asked the new legislators to give him the weight revised within the State budget to strengthen the Secretariat of State Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second secretariat in the state with smaller budget and is inconsistent as an important economic and generator of divisions and investment and directly work with the industry field."
Besides the need to label resources for detoning tourist projects and to assist the state and update to the Alcohol Act which have not been able to solve in previous legislation.

Women, chariots and bicycles, among other players, are the angle of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For your parents, the next King Day will be difficult to comply with its illusions, as your house is filled by nothing else than 12 people and a little one.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfred, Mary Guadalupe, Isaiah, José John and Miguel do not suffer the hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar give them the players and the robes that they want.
The family lives a humble home of the Salvador Allende Colony and lives daily because the father doesn't have a fixed job.
"You can sometimes see it hard because my husband has no chambe, but we sold mandarina and dad... I'll go out with the 'plebes' to sell on the street," said Cactana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, four years old, wants a girlfriend or a bicycle, while his sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie's girlfriend.

'He said to me (Josee Alfred," I would like this monster,' but I said to him, 'We'd see a son,' because he was very sweet," she remembered with tristeness of Cathyan.
For the older children, who met in school, robes and haired would be the ideal.
Mary Guadalupe, of 11 years, is 12; Isaiah, of 10 years, is 10, while Miguel is eight years old.
To José John, of 14 years, you have lacked, so one of five and half or six would be a great help.
If you want to help to make reality the dream of children of the Coonado Valenzuela family can participate in the campaign You are looking for a King Mago, giving a player or effective in the Norway Reception.
Present drug traffickers
A tenth of persecution in the framework of the departure of a production and sale of Cannabis.
Forty-four persons have been detained to different accuses.
The persecutions were made in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, especially in the places where drug production was performed.
"They have been caught around 750 plants of Cannabis, four kilometres of haughti, money and equipation for the production," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, transported from Quebec security.
In total, one men and three women were arrested, including the two heads of the network, two men of Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to compare the Sherbrooke justice palace in the next hours to their detention.
Cannabis production accuses, possession of the object of trafficking, complement and service robots, among others.
Those persecutions have been made after a long investigation that has long been held near a year.
"The information provided by the public has been allowed to carry out detentions," said Mr. Ruel.
In this police operation, some seventeen agents of the Czech Security Research Module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Department of Police of Memphremagog were participated in the Strategy Research Module.
It is possible to fight close migration without problems.
The draft law of the conservators, which, under the Government, should solve the problem of the parents loaded by Clandese migrants, will certainly face a great opposition, since the three parties of the opposition have announced the middle that could not support it.
"I'm mainly based on the Charter."
"I'm met here with a party that has created the grant that you run," said the Liberal Governor Michael Ignatieff, rounded by Members after the celebration of the week meeting of the couples.
Liberals defend that the draft law in its current form, which would allow any person to arrest until one year from a ship identified as a transport of Clandese immigrants, is infringing the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom.
The leader of Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also pointed out that it could not support the law project because he was in the wrong white.
"We are opposed and, seemingly, all the parties of the opposition are against the project, so we will see what the Government does," said Mr. Duceppe.
The criteria of the NPD in immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticians that they point out that their party is not sufficiently firm with the Canadian immigrants.
"Neodemocrats agree that measures are taken against the members of Christian paterns, and that is what we intend to do with another draft law, C-35," said Mrs. Chow.
"We do not support the draft law of the conservators because it attacks refugees and brings children for a year at least one", explains Ms. Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of the position of playing political and abuse the will of the Canadians.
"The majority of the Canadians said to Members that this type of clandest migration would not be tolerated, these criminal operations against Canada and that are treated to the country as if it was a happiness."
"There are expected that Canada takes firm measures," said Mr. Kenney.
The Government has not declared a vote of confidence on its draft law, which could bring to the country elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservator informed the QMI Agency that the Government would request the celebration of a vote so that each Member who is going to oppose will be exposed after his elector.
The new unit does not achieve unanimation
Although it was announced that a permanent unit of combating corruption and collapse was announced by John Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation committee on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been planned two days ago: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York since January of the past year.
Metropolis have a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, the advertisement of the March has been shot by surprise to more than one.
At a permanent Council meeting on the police services of Quebec last 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite Robert Dutil's presence.
This was enough to make the criteria of the party to consider the question of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, calculate this announcement as "un outcome of the clothes" and "the last hour chapter solution".
The Minister Dutil, on its part, has responded to those who fear that the political power has too much influence on the possible future unit.
"You see the results when we advise it" just indicates.
"We're aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, there is nothing to replace a public survey.
"How more Mr Charest is obliged to avoid the creation of this research commission, more people share our view, that is, which has something to hide," explains.
"The only way to have a research commission is with the division of Jean Charest," Yves Boisver says, professor of ethical and governance of the National School of Public Administration.
To go out of this dead point, suggest Quebec to grant a special mandate to the general intervention to carry out a survey on collapse and corruption.
"We should be able to extend the mandate of the general intervention", concludes.
He also believes that Quebec can cause the same competencies as a Commissioner, allowing persons to be witnessed.
The creation of a permanent quarter is not the only project in teaching in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the criminal code to improve this type of crime.
This request seems to be carried out from the fiscal of the operation of Marteau, which has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that jurisprudence is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed its Homologian Rob Nicholson, is currently focused on implementing certain amendments on this issue.
During the Implementation of 2001 related to motor groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were detained.
Posterly, Ottawa emphasized the adoption of the gangsterism Act.
Extreme monitoring ripes
Various water courses are closely monitored because of the strong precipitation registered in several regions of the province since March.
The middle of the afternoon was made a land correction in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As a preventive measure, two houses were evacuated.
For the night, another land correction was made in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
It's gone a road.
From Tuesday to middle by night, several regions recorded strong precipitations between 40 and 70 miles of rain.
Furthermore, additional 20 to 40 miles from now to Thursday by night, in the region.
The sectors located on the north of the River and the outaouais valley were the most affected.
They may receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations are subject to the disappearance of the snow that has already been accompanied in certain sectors, it is afraid that different rivers are disappeared.
The middle of the night, Quebec civil security unit delivered warnings for the Uareau and Ahigan Rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jerôme, in the Laurentides, and Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused inundances in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, strong precipitations have caused some lags to disappear in Sainte-Julian, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, strong rains have thrown a provisional punch.
As a measure of prevention, ten residents have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the delay of certain lags has caused the closure of several ways, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The civil security unit continues to warn and monitor the neighbour situation, as indicated Annik Bouchard, Security Assessant.
The Quebec’s Preview Centre, on its part, issued the Middle Average notices by communicating the strong growth of several rivers, particularly Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Ahigan, Batestan and Loup.
Partly in Dupont
The Quebec Stéphane Dupont submitted a certain revision before the Canadian Council of Radioleviation (CCNR) by contraverned statements relating to social assistance and the Haitian, as well as its large language in the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and its team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express its opinion, but certain statements contained "inexact information on social assistance, an independent representation of the wide haitian and large language that should not be used in dismissed emissions during the day."
The Council also pointed out that the discussions on the suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two persons who had been murdered, did not inflate the radiodiscipation codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints with the comments made in diffused emissions between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued after a complaint of the Common Frente of persons who receive social assistance from Quebec.
The group was rejected that the quantities mentioned in the emission were not correct.
Representatives must communicate reliable data and none to lie.
With regard to the suicide, the presentation of Stefane Dupont had shown that the suicide was a cobard act.
Most of the members of the Committee have come to the conclusion that the message transmitted was that the suicide should not be considered as a solution to life-related issues.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the embodies in the terms of "Dupont the middle" have discussed a delicate and appropriate issue.
Therefore, any offence has been rejected in this regard.
The last license was referring to the statements made after the earthquake of Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had protagoned a Medical Influence that had raised many reactions.
The CHOI representative declared that no donation had been made to help Haitians because he could not know with security whether the needed persons would really receive money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that its acumulative effect is an independently negative representation of the Haitian.
"I have completed my suspension of three days there."
"My exhibition is clean a year ago," the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee states the emission of large languages.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio chain has cooperated "including more than the required".
The consequences shall be minimum for the issuer, which should, among other things, announce decisions once in the more hearing hours of three days.
A King of Cong-fu in Montreal
The monastery of the original Nacereddine Zemmal has had a extremely peculiar recovery.
The atlet, which emphasises in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai box, rises to the tatamies and rings of the world in searching for new challenges.
"I have been able to practise maritime arts such as cong-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who lives in metropolis since 2008 to advance the professional level.
"In my case, I'm looking for fighting everywhere because, for those who do not enjoy the ground game that affect mixed marine arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The workshop, working as a security agent and as a employer of the UPS firm, has recently given bad news to his rivals, gaining two gold medals in the World Amator of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held from 23 to 30 October in Edimburg, Scozia.
"I win in kickboxing full contact and thai box", explained.
"I'm currently ready to participate in the sanctuary world's coffee in China."
"There will invite the sports that have completed between the four first posts in the last world campaign every category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, it was finished in eight places."
"In 2007, in China, I ended the tour at the fifth place, but I reached the third post in Toronto in 2009," added.
"The interesting is that I went progressing every competition."
"To this step, I'll be the first time or the year that's coming."
The "san shou" or "Sand" is a originary discipline of China in which it is allowed to struck with the knees and the feet, as well as to lay the adversaries on the ground.
The infringements are originally held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous pugilist in this type of fight is the American of Vietnamita Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of maritime arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only keep a competition on his road, it will certainly take care of the great "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Cong-fu.
"This competition is the most notory and pregnant in China", explains the boy.
"It's like the equivalent to the Lumpinee Station (the larger stadium of Thailand). "
"It was an incredible experience."
Zemmal gained his first fight, in the semi-finals of its category (80 kg), but lost at the end.
"He who won me is a real professional." I think.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg).
"The semi-final winners are focused at the end of their category."
"After, the campaigns of each category are focused to coronate a single campaign, the King of the Cong-fu."
450 million contracts without licenses
Hydro-Québec has granted direct contracts by $450 million to engineering companies for the hydroelectricity hydromectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the center of more than hundred contracts, the BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor, which has obtained the most important contract, the project management, by a sum of 295 million.
The consortium called Energy, was created in 2004 by the decision of Hydro-Québec to confid the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important hydrolectric project of $5,000 million.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Generance Consortium obtained the contract unprecedented public delivery.
For the Party, the proceedings for enterprises poses a serious ethical problem that threatens the removal of competition and causes prices to be sustained.
"It is a new method of colution and elimination of competition."
"I mean, people, instead of doing it secretly, now do it openly," said the Deputy of the Party to bear Sylvain Simard in a press road.
On the morning, Mr. Simard put the question in the National Assembly, as it stated, it does not understand how public interest can be benefited in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, answered afternoon, notably denied that a colution has been made with this contract.
"Every to cansy me," protested, defending that the PQ had acted in the way "unhonest" and "acknowledged rigor."
He noted that "the minimum" would be the PQ disclosure.
Consortions form is a common practice throughout the world.
Usually, it is a partnership with a temporary limit that allows two or more enterprises to group their knowledge to respond to a comprehensive project delivery.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the size of the work.
Works have already started and continued until 2012.
In all cases, the contract has been granted without entering competition in the game; it has been negotiated.
Furthermore, the formula of consortions left that the exception of the standard in Quebec, including with relatively simple projects.
As published last week, The Devoir formula of consultations in the technical advice sector is undertaken in the Government's research.
A fast view to Quebec trade registration allows to identify more than 200 consortions, some of which seems permanent.
So the Dessau company is working in partnership with most of its principal competitors, such as CIMA+, Gennivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche and Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are tens of them, leads to one legal person, i.e., Dessau.
As regards the Energy Energy Consortment, the Minister Normandeau stressed that "the Bahia James territory responds to a specific work manner dynamic and Hydro-Québec respondes specifically to her from the 1970s."
The great chief of the Eastman project, Real Laport, the Baie James Energy Society (SEBJ), has explained that the project management contract has been directly granted.
"If you answer to a delivery and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can enter into contact with the sector actors and say to them: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and a good price."
"But the idea is that it is not the price, but the competence of people," said Mr. Laport.
The Energy Energy Consortment contract is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Czechs Party.
The contracts were granted by Hydro Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcel-Rupert project.
The Devoir has identified 109 technical advice contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to enterprises or daughters, in particular geotechnic laboratory.
SNC-Lavalin received 22 contracts, Génivar pursued 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in energy.
All contracts were negotiated.
Between $449,783,344, including the Energy Agreement of 295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has understood that the four companies forming the consortion (BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor Group) are "good knowledge of Quebec Free Party".
The Minister Normandeau has left to fall that the PQ is also bound to these companys, which "financen", before it provides that it is better than its leaders.
Barmeter of the responsible consumer. The "verde" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply expensive.
The consumer must not be trusted in the actors of sustainable development, as well as in fair trade marks or in ecological certificates to conduct their elections.
According to the Barometer of the responsible consumer, whose first results were published yesterday, the situation is still worse. The consumer is undertaken in a medicine universe where messages defending more responsibility, but regrets the lack of reliable information and believes that it is even angry of its commitment.
Even if it has increased the consumption of the products called "socially responsible" in 2010, the Chebeks seem to give very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds say that they have not trusted the environmental commitment of the companies or the ecologists of the same publicity, the measure tool developed by the Observatory of the Consumer of the University of Sherbrooke responsible for the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers are certainly confidential of official certificates that bring the products called fair, as well as the credibility of products and marks that take labels by indicate that they are "ecutable", the Barometer states.
In the same way, only 14.6 per cent of the Québeks are seriously addressed by political talks on this matter.
In any case, the responsible consumer information seems essential to stimulate this consumption sector, currently maintained by a third of those consumers.
In fact, the laguns and the sustainable nature of the information makes 46 per cent of consumers deserve this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
Furthermore, a third of the Chebeks say to dissociate the benefits of ecological products or services that are attempting to sell them.
In addition, the half of consumers changed their homes in 2010 and, in particular, changed the mark of one or several products to respect their convictions.
A 61% has given priority to purchases in the barrier's tents and has preferred to buy food products built in its region, the Barometer notes.
More green and responsible (the responsive consumption index has reached 64 points on a maximum of hundreds this year), the Quebec Consumus worships the position of the King of Reciclation, which is trying to reduce its impact on the environmental career by the protection of fauna.
However, according to Barometer, that social conscience seems to be from the outdoor doors: in 2010, only 28 per cent of the Chebeks indicated that public transport has been used or shared the car to protect its ecological principles.
Furthermore, 39.1% of the participants of this broad behaviour survey, which has completed its first edition, supports the use of bicyclette and footplaces.
A premium for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, who requested a financial commitment to the recovery of the eXcentris Complex for the Angous Society and Parallel, accepts cooperation, but only through a prize.
The Angous Development Society and Parallel, waiting for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Cultural Development to buy Daniel Langlois the cinematographic complex andXcentris in the bulevar Saint-Laurent and returning his true vocational vocation, did not get what they asked.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but in its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a price which would, in fact, be lower than the initial expectations; it could be a viable solution in advantages, at least in view of certain public employees.
Quebec has already rejected a first plan of action and a request of 12,8 million, but since then the requests were revised to lower.
The Chairman of the Cultural Development Society (SODEC), François Macerola, member of the eXcentris Exponent, made a proposal and a plan of action to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a last report ago a decade of days.
The SODEC, however, received a contra-proposal of the tunnelet on Tuesday.
Parallel and Angus have a period until 31 December to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a State donation must be completely disappeared.
Remember that Quebec's ownership of cinematographical and complex cinematographical sals Association was opposed to a direct investment of the State to support eXcentris recovery, arguing that the Ministry of Culturation should not finance real projects, since it has not done it with other kitchen rooms.
On the other hand, different sector representatives call considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the same, has led the charge of the author's cine in its places, after financing its own construction, which could justify a derogation by the Tesor Council.
The lack of sales for independent films was patent in Montreal and eXcentris had known to trust his client.
The Anus and Parallel company, directed by Christian Yaccarini, impulsed a private financing campaign, waiting to meet $700,000 to open the way towards the purchase.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of these rooms, Parallel, continues to produce films in eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reaper the three rooms on the next 27th February, projecting the price film of Xavier Beauvois "The men and gods".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not returned to contact with Le Devoir and we do not know what they think him and his group of the proposals they have received.
Canada's filled vessel is risen...
The new diplomatic diplomatic cables reported by WikiLeaks demonstrate what the United States considers as the complex of Canadians with regard to the United States, but reflect the feelings of superiority of these last to Canada.
The United States diplomatics are surprised that the Canadian electors do not stand in the Canadian and United States relations when they are voting and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the conservative government to achieve its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between Ottawa and Washington's American emblement that have been made yesterday, offer more detailed games that are actually substantial.
A cable of 22 September 2008, which is, during the full of the federal electoral campaign, tells what point the United States do not go into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This proved a great surprise to the American embarrassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides some explanations on this situation.
"When political leaders are conditioned by a complex of practically inherent to Canadians at the time of negotiating daily domestic issues, instead of leave such election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign) " .
Therefore, it concludes that the United States are "the prospective election: all presents, but potentially too dangerous to speak about it."
The emblemator has even more problems to understand this "incorrect silence" because the two countries are intensive political and economic relations.
"Logly, think, the capacity of a candidate, a party and, further, the head of a party to manage these key relations should be a key factor in which the electors should think at the time of vote."
This feeling of importance can also be observed by Terry Breese, on 22 January 2009, to prepare the President Barack Obama for its first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will contribute to the survival of the Government during the confidence vote on February principles, through which Canada will first register the deficiency in the last decade because of a recruitment plan of $30,000 to $40,000,40,000 in the first time."
On any other hand, it is mentioned that the Government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas in order to prevent him to replace the coalition or that the parties of the opposition would constitute their survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another report of January 2008 signed by the Wilkins Embarador to Washington on the most negative image that transmit the dramatic series in the United States CBC.
The emblemsor is concerned about the emission of Border, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little sustainable references are carried out to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even to the secures to make the CIA real energy demands.
Another cable note that, during his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French homologus Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be ready to join some guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered that yes, but that he was "affecting every case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote: "He delivered a document to the State Secretariat concerning Omar Khadr, a musulman of 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The Secretariat agreed to revise the expert."
Finally, we can mention that the anniums have been calmed in connection with the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, old consequent very close to Stephen Harper, declared in the CBC radio that the responsibility of this massive flight should be "assassined".
In the United States, Mike Huckabee's economist.
A global plan to renew lighting
Today, the United Nations has proposed a renewing plan of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in hundred countries to reduce winter-effect gases (GEI) in a amount that practically corresponds to a third of the additional reduction that should be carried out to stabilise the planet climate before 2020.
This ambitious plan is engaged in the whole of large projects that the United Nations is expected to be adopted in Cancún to compensate the lack of associated reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the yesterday plan, if inchange bombs, still monopolised between 50 and 70% of the market, are replaced by fluocompact bombs, or, still better, by electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), would be prevented by large part of the 1.800 million tonnes of GEI emitted on the plane for lighting humans.
The lighting is responsible for 8 per cent of the global emissions.
It is the equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the planning automobilistic park.
In Copenhague, last year, the large emisor countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, were engaged with a number of voluntary reduction plans that had to reduce global emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 GT should still be reduced to stabilize, before 2020, the increase in temperatures at two center levels to avoid disappearance.
In incanning bombs, 95% of energy is disappeared in the form of warmth and the rest, i.e. by 5%, light produces.
In the case of fluocompact bombs, energy expenditure is reduced to 75% and with new LED bombs, two times more energy consumption is reduced.
The fluocompact bombs will take a average of 6.000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bombs, such as Philips manufacturer has launched this week (a company who has also participated in the United Nations study), have a hope of life of 25,000 hours and consumes 80% less than an inchanged bomb, which allows us to make an idea of ahorro that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in hundreds of countries.
These new bombs can also work with rehosts and emit very little warm.
Sure, they do not contain anything of mercury.
Different specialists have shown their reservations relating to fluocompact bombs, as they contain mercury and that they should be removed as dangerous residues, which is not always possible in developing countries, except manufacturers have instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not the fluocompact bombs, but the thermic carbon thermal centers, which are emitted a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that is disappeared with inchanged bombs.
Only in the United States, these centres are equipped with 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that would provide this international programme to each country.
For example, Indonesia would be assisted by thousands of dollars per year in electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, i.e. the equivalent to 3,5 technicians which would cost 2.5 million.
Costa de Marfil carefully waits announcement of the electoral results
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-monon, requested the " immediate" publication of the results of the presidency elections in Costa of Marfil, since they have expired the deadlines set.
" The Secretary-General emphasized the need for an independent electoral committee to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," made a carrier of the Chief of the United Nations.
"Requests all Costa de Marfil and the institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibilities and to be abstained from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exercised by some foreign governments, the electoral commission left that the average day of the middle at middle night without the results are published, three days from the Sunday scrutiny.
Forty-minutes before the end of the term, the President of the CEI had started the television that the Commission had "week worked" to announce the results.
The middle has been multiplied in the world the requests that the CEI finally proclaims the name of the winter of the second back between Laurent Gbagbo and its opposite Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo band takes into account the anulation by the Constitutional Council of the "fraudlent" votes in the north, in hands of the former rebellation of the new Forces (FN) since the State attack falled in September 2002.
Pascal Habi N'Guessan, director of the Costa Chairman of Marfil, stated that the managers of intimidation of the electors carried out by the NF in the north of the country had dismissed the followers of the President who went to vote.
All the election could be cleared if the Constitutional Council accepts the requests submitted by Gbagbo.
Now, the adversary of Gbagbo consider that the highest court of the country is not neutra, because he is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political friend of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the northern who dismisses any relationship with the old rebels, has judged the "inacceptable" delay in the publication of the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he has not gone so far as to revival the victory.
Its fellows claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that it has lost and that there is a complaint before the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission to disseminate the results would be illegal.
The second turn from the presidency, on Sunday, should have been led to the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided in two years ago.
The United Nations has warned the Middle of the Costa Political class that could be considered responsible for possible violence acts.
Laurent Gbagbo ended on 31 October, with 38 per cent of the votes against Alassane Ouattara, which publicly received support by the former President Henri Konan Bedié (25 per cent in the first turn).
The unemployment rate remains stabil in France in the third quarter

It was only registered a couple stability between age persons between 25 and 49 years, with 8.3% in continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in a year) and 8.8% in all France.
Since 2006, Insee has not published the monthly time rate, after a polematic on its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union statistics Agency continued to do it and announce a 9,8 per cent of France (including DOM) in October, after 9,9 per cent in September.
Alexandere Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandere Guerini, 53 years old, directed to residues treatment companies and brother of the PS President of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, has been investigated and has been entailed in the Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence, in the framework of an investigation on publicly fraudulent contracts.
Alexandere Guerini is investigated by abuse of social goods, distortion of public funds and goods, coverage, active corruption, trafficking of immigration and munition, as indicated in its submission.
"Alexandr Guerini will fight and answer all the questions that the judge plans, not fantasms."
"It's easy to persecute him by a multitude of reprensible acts, another thing is demonstrated to them," said the AFP to his abogada, Florence Rault, before the comparison of his customer.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the leader of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, wished to transmit through his lawyers to the judge before its comparison, a document to be explained.
The middle of the night began to investigate and acquired one of his neighbors, Philip Rapezzi.
According to your lawyer, Mr Lucien Simon, the only one you have done your customer has been occupied of the traders that must be managed.
With regard to the allocation of contracts or destination of the funds relating to its implementation, he knows nothing in this regard, as said by the leader Simon.
In the context of this decree, it is also investigated from the Middle of Daniel Pinna, the former general Director of the City Aglomeration Services of Aubagne, because of the damage of funds and compliance, but has left him in a conditional freedom and has prohibited meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts they reproached to him."
"The Instructor has taken into account the statements and left him free," said Mr. Yann Arnoux, a lawyer.
On Tuesday's night to Wednesday, another four persons asked and left them the freedom, under the court control of two of them, as indicated by the added fiscal of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, adjoint Director of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), has been accused by "attractive influences and passive corruption".
Two officials of the Aubagne Aglomeration, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned by "extraction and disagreement of public goods by a person dedicated to the public service" and "completed in the disagreement of public funds", respectively.
Finally, the company of Alexandere Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, is investigated by "detection of the abuse of social goods".
Among those who have faced Mr Guérini is the Tephane Bruengo-Girard, recently encountered in a paralel case of fraudulent public contracts affected by Korea.
Researchers are suspected that their societys have served to blame the capital of the great bandidism.
The investigation is carried out in the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 after receipt of anonymous communications, of course, fraude in the allocation of public contracts, particularly in the sector of residues.
A source close to the research indicates that investigations are particularly focused on the terms of allocation and functioning of a grant in the Chiotat, which collects the disasters of Aubagne, as well as from other cities of the urban community in Marsella (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: Eliseo has exhibited Syria's media
During more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the destination of Clotilde Reiss, the young French investigator arrested in Iran by "spionaje" has been sentenced to the public in France, warned the diplomacy and focused the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Teheran.
All under the viewed attention of the United States diplomatics.
The United States documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le World discovered some unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Elizabeth has explained its strategy to the United States to give them counsels to manage their own "rehenes" crisis in Iran (a small group of seminars).
It shows how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the French youth has not been exchanged by the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and seeked by American justice by traffic of materials for Iran.
Finally, they have revealed the fact that the French Presidency had tried to manipulate communications to give the idea that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he did nothing.
A diplomatic telegram, developed on 12 August 2009 in Paris, contains the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage reaction cases".
Eliseo Consequent for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, joint by the Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaking with the United States Diplomatic Cathleen Allegrone.
It explains the French method.
They advise the United States that are doing as follows to repatriate their own citizens with force in Iran.
"It's noise," they say, "continued" in the media of communication the words "the fundamental humans", "inconsistent", "direct libration".
Everything to shame the Iranian regime, careful of your image.
"When the Iranians ask you to talk, do it more frequently."
Since, once we have tried to negotiate by discreet channels, "the silence will not solve anything," Iranians are "experts in dilatory managers".
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "un ordinary iranian tactics: the absent for political chloride".
Announces that the release of prison from Clotilde Ries (the day of 16 August, when it is refuge in France) "the wage of a large amount of money" ($230,000).
Furthermore, he notes that Elizabeth anticipates other rehension crisis, a phenomenon that "a growing."
The Iranians could "in a next future arrest the next one of the French citizens who live in Iran," states.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss comes from prison after 12 days, but it remains blocked in Iran.
The following information is diffused: Iraní Majid Kakavand, whose extradition, requesting the United States for illicit electronic trafficking to Iran, has been made free in Paris by a judge decision.
The US embarrassement, as well as many observers, despite this strange consent.
For Washington, which is close to the Iranian clandest networks of acquisition of material for the nuclear programme, the excarcelation of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Have you accepted a exchange?
Live Iran to change French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allgrone on 4 September, François Richier guarantees that it was not so.
Elizabeth, claims, not only "he has been very surprised by the decision of the judge," but he has tried to oppose himself.
"There had intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (in the time Michele Alliot-Marie), but "The French Government can't announce the decision" judicial.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand continues under the "stream" monitoring of French information services.
The consulent of Eliseo marks a number of phones, cut and then informs the United States diplomatics that "Iran is currently found in some Paris buildings managed by Iran's embarrass."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elisao does not escape in efforts, use communications and "fucks" organized in communication means to believe that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influent" of "meditor".
The United States observe this activity with some irony and make sure that manipulation brings its fruit, since several press articles transmit the French official version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentioned the 'bitz' mediatic' of French officials.
What this "gratefulness" must be made towards Mr Assad, the embarrassement in Paris is asked.
"In spite of their full appreciation declarations, French officials acknowledge that they just have a vague idea of what they really have done to Syria."
Furthermore, the document is concerned about the reasons they have brought to Elisha to stand on this fiction.
The great communications efforts are "in order to validate Sarkozy's opening policy toward Syria," considers.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in view of many critical voices in France and in the foreignland, was ended with premature and desmerecy."
By "exercise the Syrian paper," Paris trys to "to show Syria the elogios that can plunder if it plays a constructive role in the region."
The goal also consists of "subscribe the seed of the dispute between Syria and Iran".
The American embracy knows it about a good source.
On August 11, François Richier trusts him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done something or not."
"But in any way, we thanked."
"Of least, this should cause confusion between Iran."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in Elizabeth.
In a communication, I thank the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria who have played a "active package for the release of our fellowship".
From midnight, young Koreans can't play online
The surrounding Government will adopt a "Cenent law" which will prevent adolescents to participate on online games after average night by blocking their access, as indicated by government responsible.
In December, a draft law will be submitted to Parliament in order to request online games companies that block access to these games after midnight to young people less than 16 years, as indicated by representatives of the Ministry of Cultural and Family.
"Much children play all night and then it is difficult to study at school and to take a normal life during the day."
"We think that this law is necessary to protect their health and dream right," said AFP Jo Rin, official ministerial responsible for the draft law.
Online games will be available to the six morning.
The enterprises will have a year to be prepared for the application of the law, precisely.
The Government is also planned to ask firms to limit daily access time to these games when youth parents were requested so, he added the responsible.
Furthermore, it will be available to which it requires free informal programs that allow the Internet connection time to be limited.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and the newspapers regularly gives news on different facts related to an intensive Internet use.
The country is also the insufficient campaign of the world play competition of online games.
In November, South Korea received four gold medals in the World Cyber Games, where other 58 countries were concentrated.
World 2018-2022: FIFA designs organizational countries
In the middle of the torment caused by corruption suspicions, the Executive Committee of the FIFA designs the Thursday to the organizational countries of the Copas world in 2018 and 2022, a clear political choice where influence and lobbing fights can be prior to technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the edition of the FIFA's competition will be held in Europe, traditional basis for disciplina (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and Netherlands).
The edition of 2022 will be more emerging, since the International Federation is expected to acquire new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a street in the African continent in 2010, or to continue its installation in the United States or east League (Japon, South Korea).
The list of personalities made by delegations (David Cameron, Princess William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapather, José Scrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Government heads, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) asserts the economic and political interests in a world.
Transactions between staffers, therefore, can be held up to the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a jerarchy between candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, English, Spanish and Portuguese candidates (2018) and the United States (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of vote.
Sunday Times, responsible for the discovery leading to the suspension by the corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temrii and Amos Adamu), could so have taken the opportunities of his country, the flower cune, which only had collected the world once in 1966.
The BBC added wood to the housing by the decrease of a documentary that had made a evidence to three EU members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa lifeou.
Successful to disgusy the FIFA and warn the English licenses, who have been launched in intensive lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron to his head.
The Chief of the Government is expected to reform the slaughter granted by his predecessor Tony Blair, which had been achieved in 2005 for London for the J.O. 2012.
This intensive activity, will it be enough to recover England's light to the EC?
It is not clear, since the dju spanish-Portugal also contains many strong points thanks to its statistics, already ready, their experience (Mundary of 82 in Spain, JJ.O in Barcelona in 1992, Copa of Europe in Portugal) and its erobolistic culture.
However, the economic and financial perspectives of both countries could result in their ambitions below.
The possible representatives against English and doubts about the solution of Spain and Portugal is the only thing they are to give Russia to a weight outward, despite the laguns in their candidature (stadios, hotels, transport).
However, the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move up to Zurich and stated an "unlawful competence in the preparation of the vote" in a direct statement to the accused of the English press against the members of the EC.
"You're going to solve their sucks, trying to engage them," said Putin.
For 2022, the United States, which have 1994 experience, seems to be the most logical improvements.
The first world economic power and the heading of the FIFA sponsors, the country seems to bear advantages to Japan and South Korea, which have developed separately a excellent project.
However, these new candidates seem to be premature for two countries who have organized together the campeonate in 2002.
Another risk: the concessing of the World 2026 to China, which would be intended by the FIFA, which would cause Asia to be without possibilities for 2022.
Instead to Qatar, which has presented its project based on future statistics, and Australia, the FIFA would continue with its expansion to new horizontals, but both countries have more risks than certain.
Australia, as Japan and Korea, could also be condemned by the weakness of payed TV rights (on the basis of the time distinction) by European countries, the backing street of the war for the FIFA.
Second mandate: the test
The Gaulle was really sure.
Mitterrand had understood it.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and James Chirac didn't have any doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is still less.
A mandate in Elisha leads to another.
The current head of State will therefore be candidate in 2012.
However, the tests of this are not well combined with the mystery that it wishes to be involved in the presidency function.
So it's always needs to appear that it's a doubt.
Do one side and the other.
In 2006, though they did not believe it, James Chirac’s friends claimed that he wasn't abandoned a third term.
On 15 November, seriously, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would take its decision "in some time at October 2011".
Therefore, the fact that you treat with the Members of the UMP, the Tuesday by night in Elizabeth, the possibility of "the two mandates" has caused some review.
Is this the official advertisement of its candidature?
Not much less.
The President only indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 was limited to two of the mandates of five years.
It was simply transmitted the facts, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he speaks of the presidency, with a young tone, in meetings of this type.
"In the worse, or better, of the cases, you'll still spend seven years and half with me," was left in July 2009.
Another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I don't plan what will happen after."
Their claims of pre-average are not closer to the candidature, nor even less.
Except comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the road by candidature on the PS, on one side.
But it's not the fact that Segolène Royal has come up to the palster what brings to Nicolas Sarkozy to sink.
In contrast, the fact that its candidature is clear in 2012 is what leads to many of the PS people to call for the battle before the planned.
On the other side, the bad sounds.
For the first time, the right electors prefer the candidature of François Fillon to the Nicolas Sarkozy ( 46% towards 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject," he immediately reactiond the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"There will always think it can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned before evidence.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain the acquisition of State laws
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) should allow to clarify the criteria for the output of the crisis or at least announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that should end at the end of the year.
In the context of the crisis of the European Sovereign Debt, the Frankfurt Emission Institute cannot be so percentaged if it does not wish to enhance a situation more than today complied on the European obligations markets.
Political costs would be equal to high.
Today, during a press race, the Minister of French Finance, Christianne Lagarde has supported the active role played by the ECB in favour of the solution of the crisis of the debt of the European States.
It was not intended to say if it was considered that the Central Bank should make more, for example, increased its programme of purchase of State obligations.
"I reserve my opinion for my European partners"...
In Brussels, during its hearing to the European Parliament's Commission on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not been more illustrated in its intentions, noting only that the State purchase programme on the second market "continued" and that "we will see what we decide" during the Thursday meeting.
The only thing that remains clear is that the ECB will maintain its main invariable type in 1%, the lower level of his history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of the Texaser obligations by the ECB has duplicated the past week to reach approximately 1.350 million euros.
In addition, in accordance with the market indicators, yesterday would have bought new Irish and Portuguese titles.
In total, the euro-system central banks received titles for a amount of 67,000 euros since May 2010.
The market operators do not have any doubt that they will follow the purchases (see page 29).
The economicists do not provide any significant changes of rumbo.
Although the expenditure operations have already been disappeared from the ECB arsenal, it has still been unlimited allocations of liquidity to benefits and long-terms between a week and three months.
Economists hope that this device is extended for a few months.
"I don't think I'm going to change considerably your program."
"If not, it would lead to the risk of provoking new short-term tensions," says Michael Schubert, economicist of the Commerzbank.
"There is more likely that a progressive outcome has been announced during the first quarter of 2011," advanced Norbert Bräms, economicist in Sal.
OK home.
With regard to public debt interventions on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of buying these obligations to maintain the market," adds Norbert Bräms.
In view of the importance of the expositions of the European banks to the sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the emission Institute has no option to keep its presence on the market.
"It must compensate any price the lack of investors on the market and act so that a marked submission of the performances of the most popular States should be made up tomorrow a significant manager of obligations".
Because, if the types of interest are being made by the clouds, States will have more problems to reduce their defence, or even to stabilize it.
This is the price to protect the euro.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government takes time
After Italy had started a week of an worry way, the situation had slightly improved yesterday with the refluence of the types of commitments to 10 years.
A recovery of the precarious calm.
At the outcome of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional Presidents stated that they listed to Giuliao Tremonti to qualify the situation of "incredible" and expected a "improvisible" end of a week, statements denied after the interested.
In any case, the March, the difference with the long-term types of Germans had reached the correct number of 210 basic points and the price of the cover contracts against the risk of quiebra (CRQ) was dispersed up to 263 points, provocating a certain record in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that the difference with the German types was over 400 basic points in Spain.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" by "tourving in the markets" and by a possible contact from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," Irwin Sttelzer, economicist at Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the removal of income related to the same, which leads to the State to the risk of not to be able to do with its financing needs.
The last provisions of Brussels have proposed a fresh water wheel for the government.
It is calculated that Italian growth will achieve 1,1 per cent in 2011 and 1,4 per cent in 2012, while the budget in the Senate is based on 1,3 per cent and 2 per cent respectively.
In these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4,3% of PIB in the year which is coming (only 3,9% planned by the Government) and 3,5% in 2012 (only 2,7%).
This is the notion that new budgetary provisions may be applied after the feasts for a amount of 7.000 million euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," said the Commissioner of Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
At this time, Italy takes into account the support of international institutions.
"The bases of its economy are in order and their accounts in good state, as we have said since time," ensures Arigo Sadun, the Italian Administrator in the Italian International Monetary Fund responsible for the FMI.
"There is no immediate, nor short or long-term problem, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of PIB in 2011, NDLR), the efforts for stabilization requested to Italy are less than those required to other countries," made Pier Carlo Padoan, OCDE Chief.
The problem of political instability is.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be focused on a censure motion in the Chamber of Members, after which the elections could be prior to the end of March.
In that case, a little appropriate period would be opened to take decisions in the case of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect the strengthening of crisis mechanisms
Christianne Lagarde has already repeated it yesterday during a presse road in Paris: "I believe we have already shown Sunday, night and day, that Europeans are clearly solidary, decided, binding with the defence of their currency and their monetary area."
Although it was related, the relation registered yesterday in the types of obligations of the European States has encouraged Governments and the ECB.
However, we can't still speak of a principle of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's Calification Agency announced that it could be low to the calculation of the Portuguese debt, the most frequent white in the modernity of the speculations.
"In the same way as in May, there is really political clarity and transparency, which significantly deeply on banking systems," believe the External BNP Paribas Economists.
Specially because "the political rhythm is far lower than the market ritmo."
Aware of this pit and the danger that it is hidden, European countries strengthen the debates to strengthen existing crisis outcome mechanisms.
Information consultations between the Ministers of Finance, which are more directly affected and generally with their G-20 homologs.
And this also take into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and of the Ecofin at the beginning of the week coming.
The ECB meets today.
In the agenda, the type of non-conventional support measures to the euro area's countries in the market collector (see above).
With regard to the European Finance Stability Fund (FEEF), its Executive Director, Claus Regling, has launched the March in Singapore a resorted by Asia to inform the investors of the East League's news in Europe.
Although the goal of these visits does not include funds, it is certainly prepared for the field.
The first EEF title emissions shall be implemented on the next month.
Today, a representative of the United States official trusted the Reuters Agency that the United States would support a potential increase in mobilized funds through an additional IMF commitment.
As regards countries in first line, Portugal and Spain, they are prepared to adopt structural reforms, particularly in relation to the organization of the labour market.
These reforms are subject to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisboa and Madrid wants to advance a different way following Greece and Ireland.
Boths want to avoid any cost to request international assistance before the implementation of their own budgetary correlations and to decide the structural reforms that are considered necessary to increase long-term confidence.
The capitalist partners of the European Funds are finally planned to accelerate the standardization process of public obligations.
On 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the 750,000 euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not doubt to take back the card.
The Barclays Capital economists, a first line actor on the European public debt market, considers that a amount of approximately 10 million euros would be sufficient, "preferently" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is an instrument for this: the European financial stabilization mechanism, which is currently $60,000.
A council that, uncertainly, might be able to review detailed European capitals.
Specially if they start market conditions.
Sleeve and glass: 24 apartments in naranja alert
Nevate continues to cause circulation difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, four-four apartments are present in narrow warning due to the risk of nuts and ice training.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Duux-Swevres and Vienna joined the twentieth apartments that were already in naranja apartment, 10 from the middle at the middle of the day and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group by night.
According to the Medium of France, strong sneeved necks affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, even though he was slowly nest in France Island.
The snow captures of between 2 and 5 cm are expected, of between 7 and 10 cm, in the concerned departments and between 1 and 3 cm or even 5 cm in the parish region.
The apartments affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Armor Côtes, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Baja Norman Island, France and Lemosin.
Nevads are sufficiently strong as to cause circulation difficulties and affect some economic activities, the Mediterranean warning.
In the Coasts d'Armor, access to various departmental routes has been prohibited to more than 7.5 tons, including Guingamp-Lannion eye and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
According to the gendarmes, the circulation into the secondary network of Britain is complicated, so they recommend that it should not be conducted except if necessary and the movement of certain TER vehicles has been prohibited during the day.
During Thursday, school transport has been prohibited in Picardia.
No specific measure was provided for the night to limit the movement of weak vehicles.
The prefection "attracts all leaders to conduct with the greatest skills on the roads and to adapt their conduct to the situation".
The Guideline of Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested the airlines to blame the Thursday 25% of its flights in the Russian Party Airport and 10% in Orly because of the planned necks.
The DGAC recommends air passengers that are contacted with their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick airport, southern London, and Edinburgh in Scozia are closed until Thursday tomorrow.
Mother of Grand Paris: First Financiers
Since the debate on the modernization of the transport in France has reached its active point, thousands of millions.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we speak of the 23,000 million for the metro of the Grand Paris, which must build the Grand Paris Society.
In order to start this SGP, the State has announced a fund allocation of $4,000 million.
At the theoretical level, this sum will be which will allow the SGP to receive prices on the markets to finance a part of its double bucket.
Today, finally, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 Rectificational Finance Law, considered in the National Assembly Finance Commission this morning, contains devices intended to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special balance tax and the increase of the tax on the offices in the France Island.
The first, as read in Article 15 of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution of the Grand Paris Society".
Furthermore, it is set in numbers: "The product of this tax is of EUR 117 million per year."
The second is an amendment of a tax on offices that already exists "for modernization, enhance its product and for this increase to the Grand Paris Society".
How long would this method be obtained?
Who knows.
There are no numbers in the text.
But he's far from 4.000 million.
"The tax resources are added to EUR 4.000 million from the allocation of funds that will be mobilized by the State and which will be granted to the Grand Paris Society as a result of the project", we can read in the exhibition of reasons.
The SGP does not surprise this system.
"To the time that income are created (two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive 4.000 million later, as we explain."
"It will be registered in the budget and will be used according to the needs."
The SGP shall be calculated that it will start receive 4.000 million in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, where 4.000 million promised not contained in the credit, can cause a slow parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Hackers and Fabrics
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it draws a apparent scene, a scanning that just seems to shoot it before the hypersensitivity that relaxes relations between States, citizens and presses.
On the other hand, announces deep changes to international level and provides a future dominated by return.
But let's go through.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each expert created by a secret service (independently from the nation which belongs) is exclusively formed by prenses.
The "extraordinary" United States revelations on Berlusconi sex coasts just reflect what has been written for months ago (except those appartening to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's symptomly ridiculated profile takes long time by giving ideas to the artists of cabaret to create their shocks.
The standard that secret officials should only be formed by public knowledge news is essential for the dynamic of secret services and not only in this century.
If you visit a library dedicated to ethnic publications, you will see that each work repeated (of the Grial, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or Rosacruz) exactly what was written in the previous works.
This should not only be given to the authors of the opening texts that do not want to make inevitated investigations (or not know where to find news on the inexistence), but because those who are dedicated to the ocultism did not only trust in what they already know, what they recognize that they have already learned.
This is the success mechanism Dan Brown.
The same is applicable to secret statements.
The informant is perceive, as he is perezosous (or has a little careful) the head of secret services (or could not be, I know what, Libération Editor), which only considers true what can be recognized.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent by the United States of Rome to the Department of State was the same to publish Newsweek the previous week.
So, why have they caused such a revue the revelations of these experts?
On the one hand, they just say what everyone has already been cultivated, that is, at least from the Second World War and since the Heads of States can be called by telephone or coach to meet the dinner, they have lost their diplomatic function and, except for some limited representation exercises, they have been transformed in spicony centres.
Any spectator seeing research films knows it perfectly, we just appear that we don't know it for hypersensitivity.
In any case, the fact of reproaching it publicly infringes the debtor of hypersensitivity and gives a bad image of the United States diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most powerful secrets of the world's world's world's most powerful secrets is considerably affected by the prestigious of the Department of State.
Therefore, the scchandle affects both victims and the "verdues".
But we enter into the real nature of what has happened.
Antigually, at Orwell's time, it could be added to all power as a Big Brother who controled every manager of his suits.
Orwell's prophecy has made a reality since it could control each movement to the phone, every performed transaction, visited hotel, self-employed, the citizen would so be converted to a full victim of power.
But when it is shown, as now happens, that even the criteria of power secrets cannot escape from the control of a hacker, the control relationship leaves to be unidirect and returns to circulate.
The power controls every citizen, but each citizen (or at least the hacker, chosen as the soldier of citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can it be kept for a power that can't already be able to keep or keep your own secrets?
It's true, as Georg Simmel said, that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be developed); it is also true that every knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, because it goes out of the public; but to develop, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty signs to remove him all power.
WikiLeaks did not hurt Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and many, Clinton and Obama.
What are the consequences of this wound caused by such power?
It is clear that, in the future, States can't put any reserved information on the network, since it would be like to publish it on a full road card.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, it cannot be expected to keep confidence conversations by telephone.
Nothing is easier to discover whether and when a Head of State has been moved to the air and has been contacted with one of the homologs.
How can you maintain private and reliable relations in the future?
I know perfectly that, at the moment, my prevision is something of fiction science, and therefore, newly, but I imagine government agents that are discreetly displaced with uncontrolled spinners, bringing messages that have been learned of memory or, as many, hiding some data written in the tactics of their sackets.
This information will be kept in one copy, in key boxes closed: at the end of the account, the Watergate's pseudonyme attempt had less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I wrote that the current technology has been progressed as a cancer, which is, towards the back.
A century after the telegraph has re-revolutioned communications, the Internet has become a telegraph with cells (phones).
Video cylinds (analgetics) were allowed to studie a film step on a step, advanced and back, discovering all the mountain secrets, while now the CDs (digitals) are only allowed to advance or return from chapter in chapter, i.e. to huge proportions.
With the high speed trains, we can go from Rome in three hours, while in the airport, with the displacement that he offers, we need three hours and average.
Therefore, it is nothing for the usual way that the policy and communication techniques bring us again to horse cars.
A last comment.
Another, the press tried to understand what was in secret in the emblemen.
Currently, the emblems who request confidential information to the press.
Clima: France's chapters in its financial promises
One year after the Copenhague Agreement, it is time to consider whether the promises of financing have been noted quickly (the fast start or precoces) carried out by the developed countries.
And the French chaps have been discovered.
In the Copenhague Agreement, developed countries were committed to provide $30,000 between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has committed to bring 7,2 million euros in three years and France 1,260 million euros (e.g. 420 million per year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has put its best letters on the table to convince its partners that its commitment with fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press wheel, an additional event, the dissemination of follets...
Transparency resulted in precipitation and it was appreciated that it was true: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same as with the same level of precisely.
The EU announces that it has released 2010 2.200 million euros, which is on the good way to meet its commitment of 7,200 million in 2012.
But if we study the situation detailed, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhague Agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that additional efforts should be achieved, without prejudice to official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there has been no agreement on what means "new and additional".
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that it is more appropriate.
For example, the European Commission has been referred to 2009: international financing is maintained and 150 million in three years are added in rapidly starting financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references regarding the year or level of official development assistance.
On the other hand, France considers that "all new projects" in 2010 are "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the costs of previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's assistance to developing countries can remain stabil (or even decrease), while it implies its commitment to "new and additional funds"...
Another crucial element, the reparation between donations and premiums.
Once again, there is no standards and every one that selects the calculation method.
Some, as France, believe that each euro is equal to a donated euro.
Of course, such things are difficult to justify: efforts are not comparable.
Although the use of costs can be justified for certain investments that are income (country, projects related to the reduction of emissions based on more effective technologies), it is false to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... as much, it should only be calculated for its commitments the cost of the payment for the country granted by the premium (e.g. the equivalent to a type of interest).
However, France is not useful: "respect" its commitment of 420 million by 91.5% of EUR (389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); see the EU's document to see it for their own eyes.
It is the only Union country that is so often uses the prize.
Germany uses it in 46 per cent, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100 per cent of donations.
In other words, when most of the European Union brings a euro to fulfil its commitment, France only gives ten cents and considers that the efforts are comparable.
A good truck!
In summary, at its fast start funding, France makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions in time and, on the other hand, in relation to the real financial efforts.
It is only 36,1 million euros, which is able to give the impression of the expenditure of 420 million "new and additional" as it had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (for it seems that Bercy is occupied by the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (Why would other Member States continue to pay when they can simply provide?) and in the negotiations, because developing countries are not thresholds...
The Chapter of the previous funding is a short-term threat in relation to the whole climate negotiations.
But it might be a growth grain in the greatest machinery that is the UNCCC.
We'll hope it's not like this.
It is essential to learn from this first year of previous financing.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for 2011 and 2012, in the intention of respecting their commitments and the same way as the remaining countries of the European Union.
However, in particular, France could make progress on the discussions on the game plans on long-term financing (other essential chapter that is currently discussed): We will not save us from the question of the "additional currency" or of the method to comply the premises.
France could change its position to become as progressive in this matter as well as others.
Therefore, we remain the hope of the new Minister of Environment, Mrs. Kosciusko-Moriet, which will come to Cancún on the week coming.
A surprise announcement on the rapid starts of France and its vision of the "additional currency" and the use of costs would contribute to enhance the level of international confidence necessary to progress in negotiations.
Advertisement of children ' s pesticides
A 10-year-old engery in a 81-year-old chemical substances, as indicated a study published by the Middle of the Futures Association (the former movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns its results, "no significant statistical value, taking into account the limited number of analyzed samples, but they are ilustrative of the treated problem", acquired in overmergeds from Oise and Paris between July and September, the foods that are to consum a child of some ten years in four foods and a tenth of day.
These foods were taken as a model, respecting official recommendations (5 parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three of milk products and 1,5 litres of water per day), as well as golosinas, were considered in laboratorys in search for chemicals, pesticides, weighted metals and other contaminants.
The plate balance results in abbreviation: 81 chemical substances, 42 of which are classified as possible or likely cancerygen and five classified substances such as secure cancer, as well as 37 substances that can act as endocrine perturbants (PE), according to the studies of various institutions such as the International Research Centre on Cancer.
"When, in practice, the whole cases are not over the legal limits for each of the chemicals individually, our study clearly shows that the exhibition of consumers to potentially contaminants and/or PE resulting concerned," said the association.
For the disappearance, the mantel and the milk contains more than a tenth of possible cancerygen residual residuals and three considered as safe cancerygens, and near a twentieth residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The manzane, imported from Brazil, planned for college, contains six chemical substances, including an prohibited function in France.
The same is applicable to the Green Jewishes of Kenya, including in food, in which the study has discovered traces of an insected insected power in the EU.
Furthermore, the Russian network, the angle on the lake and including the bread bar or the chicle were adhered with pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the water of the griff, the analysis discovered the presence of nitrates and cloruroforms.
In the dinner, the salmon road was the most "nutritive" with 34 detected chemical residues and including the analysis of the plastic plate used to calm the food in the microonds was not fully clean.
The final risk generating these "inflammatory codes" for the consumer "requestly subsistent", says the study.
The EEC-Les Verts (E-LV), on its part, proposed "creased to the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratory on the use of pesticides to fraud “the increase in civilization diseases”.
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and green in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
