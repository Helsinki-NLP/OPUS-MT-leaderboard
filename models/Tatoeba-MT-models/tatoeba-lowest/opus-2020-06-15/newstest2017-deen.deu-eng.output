Golfer Longer replaces sport piramide
His experiences on the horse are overviewable.
At the end of a golf tourist in South Africa, Bernhard was looking for a few colleagues with an exhibition on the street.
For the 58-year-old, it was a privilege.
CHIO: "Guldene Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their feast, and shot in the fast galops home to the flight road.
A kilometre at this time, I was afraid.
"It wasn't a good experience," said longer.
And so the retreat carrier was now again.
On Saturday, Germany was the best golfer of all times - 101 tourists - again near the Pferden.
He left her family about the ALRV installation, he didn't even shot into photos.
Long was the first time in Aakchen and so also the CHIO.
The reason was incredible.
The German sports helped the man from houses in the framework of a small Gala the goldene sport piramide.
In labels, there is no sympathetic sports.
Federal Service Cruz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already added him.
Longer is the 18th Price man of the sport piramide.
In Aachen, he met the first Price owner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This description means me very much," says long, "and it will not only be forgiven for sports success, but also for social commitment."
Since decades, the follow-up promotes long-term.
And so he also gave the price of 25,000 euros.
The US Masters on Saturday were included in the "Hall of Family of the German Sports".
The exposed are Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the festival Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Fahre Myhard Nehmer, Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Springreiter Alwin Schockehehle and the postum of the Handballer Erhard.
Many of these sports were coming on Saturday to Aachen.
Following the official part, the illustrate society sought to Springstadion, where the Lavazza-Preis was moving.
Bernhard Lunger held away from the great animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing trade agreements TTP - that wants to be Clinton and Trump.
However, the two US Presidency provides the tax and energy policy as well as a primary question.
The differences in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, higher philosophic difference.
This is the role of the State.
Trump wants to keep the more smaller doubts and warns how the State of the economy can damage, with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to impose the economy to death and regulate death, he says.
He himself would be very different, signed Trump.
It will return massive regulations, and it will make it to a wide range of tax reforms with lower tax rates - for private and for enterprises.
At the same time, the State has certain tasks to fulfil, he has the opportunities to open and need money.
This is why the taxes would increase for the riches, she says.
Another interestingly, both are very close to the infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton must be invested in, almost speaking.
The Democratic Reserve announced the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are disappeared about the Critical Teaparty Flow of the Republics.
So, on Trump, they could have reached the internal discussions.
Moreover, the differences in energy and climate policy.
Trump wants to build coal power tools and renew coal transport in the United States.
Oil transport should also be protected in areas which have been until the time possible, and the Paris Convention will announce the climate protection agreement.
Clinton wants to expressly build the renewable energy with its investment program and calls for “A country will be the supermacht of the cleaner energy and create millions of jobs”.
"It will be China, Germany or America, I want that we are."
However, not only in the infrastructure - also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not far away from each other.
TPP, which is the transpacial trade agreement, are not to be signed.
At the same time, the U.S.'s not to isolate international trade - but just protect the American jobs better.
They should then be better payed, ask for Clinton.
The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollar is a famine payment.
Someone wants to increase at $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this question is not completely clear: once he says: The ministry must be shot, then he says he needs not to be changed.
However, the great discussion of the coming months should be developed rather about the tax policy of both campaigns.
On the one side, Trump, which wants to disappear the economy and the citizens to cut growth.
His criticians are in line with him so that the budget effect would only be greater.
On the other side, Clinton is, who at least wants to pay more taxes, and they say that more taxes are not the solution.
Refuge: "Each lacked woman has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence is about women who flee alone, almost every day.
When they arrived in Germany, they are often traumatised.
A house offers flights.
In a big kitchen, four women sit.
Everyone has a baby there that's highest a year old.
One put her little son into his arm.
He looks nervously in the room.
His mother's dead on the table plate.
Before she notes she'll be observed.
You're laughing shortly and kicking the little ones.
The scene is normal.
Before you're talking to Katrin Bahr.
It is a business manager of Condrobs, a tractor for social assistance offers in Bayern, and is working among others with the issue of women's flight.
The four women in the kitchen are frightened.
They live in the northern munchner in one of the few decent aged meetings for women and their children in Bayern.
In January, the Condrobs has opened the establishment together with Pro Familia and Munchner Women's assistance.
It was officially opened.
60 people live there - approximately 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
Except is a wachman in front of the door.
"It's not override to say, every woman who comes here has made experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr.
"They are flighting for wars because they are politically persecuted because they are consequents or death or because their families are sending them to Europe as hope owner," she says.
In women, other reasons for flight were overlooked: "Mull people are secretly stealing because they don't see other ways."
In their homes they have made experiences with sexual violence, slaughters, homicides, slave or prostitution.
That's what she's going on.
It's on the flight.
"The leather, for example, calls for a flat water a sexual treatment, is not rarely," said heavy.
And the women are alone, they will not be protected from their families.
Those who believes that it ends when they arrived in Germany, they're rarely telling Bahr.
There would also be only women in refugee events often consider less valued and misused in cases at least.
This means that approximately 90 percent of women living in the northern Munchner, it appreciates.
"Others of the children are certainly not voluntary."
Many women are inhabited so that they don't say anything.
"or they don't believe to speak openly about the survivor because the shame is too large."
Since she often doesn't want to help, it needs more accommodations for them only, calls for train.
In Bayern, the seven survey governments are responsible for the deployment of refugees.
The question is whether they want from a similar project such as in Munich in their competence area, some respond to no.
There is no such thing in government meetings.
In Sweden, only female female women are not separately undertaken, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government's pressure speaker.
In high-bayers, under- and Mediterranean franses, there are only Stockwork or own households for only women and their children.
The exception is low-bayers, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee also calls for the “Real of Women and Gender Equality” in the European Parliament that women should be subjected separately from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it is said: "There is very important that men and women are sealed separately."
"If the private or men and women are engaged together, it may be - continued - violence against women."
In particular, the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, it is in the study.
As many women have this defence need, you can be able to make it on the Andrang that is on the house in Munich.
"Soon we have a long warning," said Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant streets: requests for new work campaigns
Assistance directors have encouraged their workers to authorize new work campaigns in their conflicts with regard to a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) requested its Council to authorize more work campaigns since September.
The JDC stated that the Minister had decided to address the concerns of the treaty.
Assistants and medical students decided in July on the conclusion of a treaty agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who were sent by the elections.
In a letter to the members which were published on Thursday on Twitter, the President of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the Government would continue to have "relatedly quiet" problems, which would lead to the treaty from being rejected.
She said: "In this regard, the JDC has decided to completely reject the proposed new treaty and has requested official new negotiations to all your concerns."
As a response to the duties of the Government, the JDC stated today a formal application for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a programme of calculating work campaigns which begins to begin September.
The battle resulted in the six-fold assistants in this year, the first overall cases in the history of the NHS.
Dr. Johann Malawana, the Head of the Assistant Officer of the BMA, returned after the election for the abolition of the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BMA.
He shared BMA members during the meetings which were still held before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, with the need to be accepted and accepted by the Treaty.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said, Jeremy Hunt would be introduced to the Treaty for Medicals in England.
Russia and Turkey: A "A Allianity of Foreign Sisters"?
It was a man who ended a crises.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey were attended on Sunday to give their hands and to an official end of the eight months for a long-term war of the words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish player in the fixed room of St. Petersburger Palastes in receipt, I can't say that Ankara wants this promise most of them.
It was the hand, yeah.
But Putin's laughter worked slowly, and he was not warming, even for his retaining circumstances.
Recep Tayip Et Erdogan reiterated his "learn friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also said that the relations with Russia would not only be returned to their old level before the crisis, but even improved.
On the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would like it would never happen.
I seemed to have his enthusiasm before.
But one of Putin's extraordinary and sustainable coffee showed that the State Chair of Russia had forgotten nothing.
Moreover, the cause of the crisis was the first which he said in its introducing words: the abolition of a Russian battle flight on the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow reaction at the time was grown burning.
Putin participated and accused Ankara to be in the back of Russia.
The past was even greater since it was started by an immoral friend.
The VAT will be difficult to build again if it is not possible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
During months, the State controlled media had a strong, unlimited attack on ankara.
Once it seemed that the Turks would bear all the fault.
The most serious complaints were the complaints of leaders that Erdogan’s own family would benefit from the illegal oil trade in Syrian areas controlled by the Islamic State.
He's pretty kidnapped.
But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting was only due to that because Putin by President Erdogan received the excuse he wanted to hear.
Russia could have been able to visit a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of an arms steel are clear on the hand.
Erdogan needs in first line all friends that he can receive after last month at a lost State reign nearly enthusished by his office.
Terror attacks on Turkey have also destroyed him.
But there are also economic reasons.
The Russian sanctions have made the Turkey heart, especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually brings several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coasts every year.
The number was almost 90% returned.
In Russia, travelers and charter companies will be easily facilitated when the flights are backed.
They count on a later seasonal attorney to the Mediterranean.
This week, the public views are more lowly fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish farmers are allowed to be again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated the following terms: "Tourists have long there, Tomaten here."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is defended on the west because it has been considered the reaction on the trial extension of power as weak answer.
This is why the persistent majority of the snow-time of EU negotiations and putin, which is able to benefit from the cool stimmation and reduce the relationship of Turkey to West.
The Russian State Head of State in Ankara has received a good for requesting the State support for the elected State bodies after the trial.
This is noted for Moscow a self-sensitiveness that itself has a deep fear of regulations.
The celebration in this glass palace on the sea, it allowed Russia and Turkey, one, as a analysis described to me, to tell "Allianity of external seasons": two countries who are disappeared from West and feel badly treated and now disappeared.
Nevertheless, although public distribution, there are still large differences between the two.
The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow has been given the role as a peace certificate, but where Russia and Turkey are supported by other sides.
It might be described that, after almost three hours, both Presidents at the press conference, they wouldn't have even signed the subject.
The President of Turkey, in fact, refused to answer a question on their differences, while Putin decided to comment them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common neur can be found in Syria.
But after months of open adversaries - and in view of the potential for a full disaster, which the NATO member Turkey speaks the Russian fighter abschos - it is certainly better that the two government heads are at least talking to each other.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scottland no longer available
The RBS Mark will only be reduced in a backoffice rolle according to the bank's term.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside Scottland.
Ross McEwan shared the BBC Scottland that the RBS Mark was connected to the global ambitions of the bank.
The Bank has been desperated since it was almost collapsed and saved for eight years ago.
Marking rates "RBS" have been used to protect other final consumer financemarks.
She supported the international sport with millions of Pfund in Sponsoring, from the Six of United Nations Rugby to the Wimbledon Sieger Andy Murray.
But now she decided to put more national brands into the focus.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Schottland but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales will change all RSB references, the decentral main session and the bourgeonotation to NatWest.
Mark Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the private business that are more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a survey of customers and employers in Inverness-shire.
He informed the BBC Scottland with: "The RSB brand will be on our investment brand and on the brand where our employees will be employed, as we are now more to a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we are not a global goal but a local goal.
Each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something else completely and our employees will work under these brands with the customers.
RBS has already said that it will not continue its six United Nations Spensoring and that it will increase the credibility of the different brands in its sports sponsory.
"There is time for us to develop themselves to the bank of the brands, because how are we focused on our internal (we have asked) on making this to a better bank for customers?" the Chair said.
It would have been very synthetic three years ago if we would have said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can restart these brands, so I think the time is coming.

Frankie is one of the best Jockey of the moderns and there is no surprise that he has reached this milestein that only had reached little before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intelligent that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.

I said, Frankie, a few weeks ago Epsum, he would have already won 6,000 wins, if he wouldn't only be a weekend and Grandturnierjockey!

Russland Putin burns stabschef Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly decided his stabshef Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was many years part of the most confidence crisis of Putin.
The 63-year-old was appointed to the Special Agency for Environment and Transport Affairs.
In the opinion of the Kreml, Putin, without an indication of reasons "the release of Ivanovs of his obligations as President of the Russian President of the President of the Russian Presidency.
Anton Vaino, who was a member of Ivanov since 2012, was appointed to his followers.
Vaino, 44, is an old diplomate.
In 1972, he was born in the Estland capital of Tallinn, ending his conclusion at the named State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo's message.
On the site of Kreml, it is called by Russian that he was later head of the government official.
He said to Putin, "Take for your confidence."
I think it is the major task of the Government to support your activities as a State Chair on Developing and Controls to implement your instructions.
Putin informed the Russian TV Sender on Friday that Ivanov asked for his posts to leave and recommended Vaino as his followers.
Are you sure the laughing faces?
This step has made Moscow secretives.
Sergei Ivanov was a long time of one of the most confident Vladimir Putins and worked as for the sowjetic secret service, the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men of the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was exposed in the television, both men stated that the stage returns to their own desire.
But, despite the laughings for the cameras, there are only little convincing here, especially now, shortly before Parliament's elections.
So here is the follow-up of a kind of power campaign?
Nobody knows it now.
But the official claim -- that a man who was the first placed as a potential President wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - has focused on great scepsis.
In his comments on Putin, which are settled on the Kreml website, Ivanov said: "I have asked you to trust at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation, these very complex posts - you might be able to say - a comprehensive posts for four years.
As it happens, I am four years and eight months Chairman of the Russian Presidency Administration.
Ivanov took the posts in December 2011.
Before he was the president of the Minister of Defence and Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the 1990s, as President of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who was replaced by the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his officer.
As putin had received the power, he called Ivanov as one of the five people whom he most confided.
One was agreed that Ivanov to Putins the second office of Russia could be President of Russia, since Putins would have trialed against the Constitution.
But these posts were taken by a further, nearly dedicated putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin was President of Minister before he was returned to the President three half years later.

Queensferry Crossing: Press now connected to fife
The project should be completed until May 2017
Ingenieure has connected the North Deck of Queensferry Crossings with the Viadukt - what means that the press is now connected to fife.
It's the first of the four conclusions of the "Detections" that approach to each of the three tours of the pockets.
The brown average of Fife is now 600 meters long and about 30,000 tonnes.
It has over 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of Beton and 46 tickets.
The project should be completed until May 2017.
Economic Minister Keith Brown took a visit to the building today and was one of the first ones who went out of the country.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolical moment at the building of the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an ingenieur art of a real episode in this project with more than 30,000 tonnes Beton and Stain, which were used only for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the conclusion between the Viadukt and the Bridge is an incredible activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for passing.
Totally, almost 79% of all the packs at their place and the last section of the deck will be received in Rosyth today, a packing for the cover, which means that the whole cover is ready to be added to his place.
Michael Martin, a project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first conclusion provides a significant milestone at each press project.
This fantastic project provides the concluded high and deep building.
After the installation of the last road cart average and its connection with the northern tour clothes in the building, we needed to close the remaining luggages on the north or landscape.
This was reached by the northern Zubringer pressure 700 billion south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massiv, since the Viadukt is a length of 222 meters, approximately 6,000 tonnes and needed to be increased at about 3% above.
Heikel, since the tolerances on which the team worked were winning, on every side they were only a few millimeters.
Happily lost everything very good.

Who builds braunshweig cheap apartments?
The SPD and Green say that future investors should be taken much more to the obligation.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunweig will lose nearly 1300 bad apartments in the next years?
The SPD suggests that the next Council will provide a "soiling concept" for the next session.
But Streit is programmed.
First, there is a question: Who will build the cheap apartments really?
A regulation does not have to do so long.
SPD Chairman of Christph Bratmann said: "We are one with the green: He who wants to build on urban areas will be 20 percent of all apartments as social accommodations."
However, the suitable apartments can also be included in the file.
However, the great struggle in the Council's House is, Bratmann: "What is the aim of investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent of these areas, but the most possible 20 percent of the apartments as social accommodation."
A new steady-based apartment-building program that is costed and still needed to be financed, must be ensured for inherents.
The problem, so Bratmann: "There is still no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants to make smaller standards as possible.
The left wants even strong investments for investors.
In the case of Bratmann, the situation in the housing market is degraded.
If the processing concept is implemented, it will ensure additional tasks in the construction management.
More personal will be needed.
It's not clear if we're getting the team forces.
However, the program is not widely: for the approximately 1260 new apartments that should be built without anyway.
But how is the loss of more than 1300 rental apartments that will result in the next years?
It will be 500 apartments until 2020.
To prevent this, the planning policy speaker Nicole Palm should now be bought outcoming bindings from the city.
Furthermore, it should be considered to take apartments back to price binding.
It's possible in the Westtown.
On one gun, the problem was solved.
Because in the Western city, it's the end of the year.
Along 1800 apartments, there can be returned to the price connection for cheap apartments.
Only: This is the owners who do not want to build apartment companies.
Since the number of social habitations in the Western city will be drastically increased, you are disappeared from the goal of the so-called disaster.
A concentration of social guards in only few cities should not be given any more.
The greens are estimating that there will be a movement in the debate.
Group President Holger Herlitschke says: "For a wide majority the CDU has to be in the boat."
However, it has focused on more buildings for family houses.
But what does not mean that a compromised cannot be found.
Pokémon Go, a jagd for health and happiness
It is valuable to see how the world changes.
This teenager and child to play no longer go out, but it's more preferred to make their free time to shoot on screens, was in the last decade of many of them.
In Pokemon Go, people are going to take from Sofa and become more active.
The time on the screen was on the televisor, then on video games and last on smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and activities are not excluded by the free.
I indeed take me to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, a app that is on the characters that were first created for video games in the 1990s (springed a sign series, play cards and other spy-offs).
How many phenomenas of the Popculture had the interest before the publication of the game in the United States, Australia and Neuseeland at the beginning of July.
The market introduction in other countries was transferred by the demand that the server translated.
In the meantime, Pokémon Go had more users than tinders and almost so many as Twitter.
How's it?
Shortly said the players go outside with their smartphones and seek Pokemons who are followed with a GPS and, once they found, "fotografic" (for a screen hot on the mobile) or "beguned".
A generation that played the game when she was yet young, awake the wrath and sprang out for the search of the Sofa.
In the U.S. the game brought a significant increase in steps that turns the "intern" person every day.
Cardiogram, a app for Apple Watch, which follows 35.000 users, shared the Washington Post shortly that within two days after the market input of the game, the number of those followed 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company don't know who plays Pokémon Go - it just sees the rail data for performance increased.
Many public public health campaigns, who want to bring people to "such 30 minutes to take the time," "hom Sofa to come" and "to be every day active" clothes on taste ears, because many public news to health are slow and coming from people who seem bad.
However, the importance of sports cannot be overvalued.
He who regularly runs sports reduces his opportunities to affect cancer or depression.
The body confirmation helps the weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages that are too long to make it here.
But the wonderful at Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the free thing that makes them fun.
Three columns of health will be covered - movement, fresh air and sunlight as well as fun.
Some people close to Jagd even new friendships.
As always there are musician players who always need to talk about something.
And yes, somebody could run to a door.
What's going on?
It's got a disappoint.
Even though the Smartphone Apps like Fiitbit had been able to follow our activity before, they didn't give us a reason to make us sports as it does this game.
The new will lose his trip and the use will be allowed with time.
However, on the basis of the success of Poemons, it will give more games that apps and virtual reality will be assembled with the active ones in the real world and so many people will be helped in the jagd, to be more active, fibres and pleasure.

Simone Biles creates gold in damage
Forget the pressure.
Forget the Hype.
Simone Biles is on all this immun.
Dynamically on the skin.
Put it on the balcony.
Atember suit on the ground.
On the whole light line.
And now, finally, Olympiaceist.
The 19-year-old American tourerer took place on Thursday to the multi-catch title and increased the lame between himself and the rest of the world in the light of the Olympian games.
Your total result of 62.198 was clearly before the silver meal and the "Final Five" managing room Aly Raisman and the Russian Bronzemedaille memory of Aliya Mustafin.
The American Simone Biles turns on the swimming bar during the world's single scene finales of women in the artist at the Olympic Sommer games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth theerosexual American who wins a more campaign title, totally the fifth while it determines its call to be the best of her generation or even even.
She went out in dreams when her final result was shown and her long journey found an end at this moment.
This success makes it in the same liga as unique atoms like Michael Phelps who have brought their sports types to new heights:
Biles has won the last three years its sport type, 15 World Meisters - including 10 gold medles - with so wonderful works that maintain a mix of eye and pressure that the Olympiasian Olympicstine of 1984 Mary Lou Retton said she was "the best tourner I've ever seen."
She was expected a last test in Brazil, a competition which was not so much between the Bilees and the rest of the Athletes, but mostly between it and a burden of overdimensioned expectations.
Nor with a handful gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be seen as a disappearance.
The American Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman are surrounded after each gold and silver in the single way of the women in the arts of the Olympic Sommers 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles took the first medaille on Sunday, while she served as a sign of calling officer Marta Karolyi.
Although Biles found it while their long way to the streets never had planned the future, it is not really true.
A part of its grounds - which contains its typical tumbling pass - is set on Latin American music that would apply home outside the Olympiaarena.
That's not an accident.
This girl, adopted by her grandfathers as a little child and discovered by Trainerin Aime Boorman's mother during a school flight in the tour hall, was trained in Boorman.
Since the summer 2013, she has not lost multicompetitive competences, a series of victory that will be stopped as long as the balance wants.
Even when Mustafins had leaned by two dragons, the picture was deceived.
Swimming bars and ground tours - in which Biles holds the world manager - lodged.
She turned back with 15,433 on the swimming bar - and put another on the ground with a 15.933.
Raisman turned around when she was waiting for her end-- a pure formality - and dreams smelled on white, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she first described in her collection book was actually described.
Raisman's performance was a race for the last four years ago when she fighted the third place, but the Bronzemedaille went to Mustafin.
This time the 22-year-old manager captain called "Oma".
After her landing, she turned to the public of Kusshvarde, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared unfortunately.
With regard to Biles, the rapidly expanding second of the 19 years from the beginning of this week has been a whole new importance:
Police: 3 victims in Serian transport in the case of music hearings in the car
According to the police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year old girl who were killed in one of the most mortal attacks since a decade of the first series of Phoenix, while they had heard and music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Malaeah were killed on 12 June while the car was divided in an entrance, the authorities said.
The thicker burned eight cups from a handy gun while he stood on the car driver and fled afterward with another vehicle, is to read in the report.
The police reported that the three-fold murder seemed not to be the result of an accident of raw, since the slaughter was not the hands or the $2,900 who were in the possession of one of the adult victims.
The police speaker of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the Schießerei made the Empires to make a closer look at whether she was connected to four previous attacks.
In the total, seven persons were killed in Spanish people within four months in nine attacks and two others were killed.
"It happens in a house-in-law before a house," said Howard of the KHPO, a daughter of CBS, beginning of the month.
It is accepted that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a braun nisan of the late 1990s, a black BMW of the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The Ombudsmans refused to open the evidence they had made to conclude that the attacks were bound and began by the same murder.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized and later disappeared.
Liner, 31, and Ellis, daughter of Maleah, still disappeared in place.
One witness told the police that it was not usually unrelated to sit in a parked car and hear music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooteri, which had a half hour before the three-fold murder, and that it was the work of the Serian transport.
The producers found sponsors and secured a kitchen out of the seat and cuts out of the motor area.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microweapon: "It will be better"
As most of the 6-year-olds loves the Singen, players and naturally his mother.
But as less of his ages, Edmund Microzephali, the result of a genetic disappearance, about which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto didn't know anything during her pregnancy.
When he came home the first time, my first mind was, I don't get it.
I can't do that.
I didn't allow me to.
Whatever is wrong -- of course, it has been put to it," she said.
Your husband Vincent and you were reported that Edmund will never be able to recognize them in circumstances and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors have even gone so far that they would like to institutionalise him.
"I didn't know that the people still do," said Picciuto.
Edmund can run with a mood.
Edmund was able to sit nor sitting nor talking to him until his third year.
But he's making a slow progress.
He can run with support and travel.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the languages that Edmund has expressed for "Bitte sing me something".
"We bring a language to him," Picciuto CBS News said.
But it's not a typical language -- she says, Edmund has found some characters alone.
Microzephali has a variety of causes: genetics as with Edmund and infections with viruses such as mass or cikavir during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognoses can be strongly varied.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the cikavir.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I always asked what's going on?
What's going on?
And she doesn't know it still.
I haven't asked for a long time after the prognosis, because I don't expect her to tell me somebody really.
But Piciuto has a pleasant advice for mothers of dogs with dogs caused by the cikavir.
It'll be better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.

Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I'm under the womenolympiamannship in the direction and that from more than one reason.
First of all the summerolympiade I was since 1984 and the United States have never been so dominant.
Secondly, this manager has three tourists, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which operate for many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this manager, Aly Raisman, who is júdin and Madison Kocian, who is catholikin, makes everybody shame.
This manager finally reflects the United States.
It has defended the black and Spanish female presence at the side of this type of sports.
In the last four years, the number was one among the female tourists of Afro Americans.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympic games, Gabby Douglas was a surprised Olympiage memory and America jubeled.
Now the world was able to be a testimony of the unbelievable performance of the three-fold Master of the world, Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected, but mystery hymmasticroutians.
On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, theerosexual American who had been obtained at a individual multicamera event for women.
Manage member Aly Raisman gained silber.
We live the lines of this type of sport, but so we can't see tour clocks throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie smote all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it in the olympic team.
They are the "Last Five", because the next Olympiaship will be only four tourers in the manager. In addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainerin.
But the reality finds that the tours are a leading sport, and the tours in the first line in private tour units that are kept by parents who are retained for trainings, institutions, travel expectations, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their tours and families). The list can be pleased.
Most of these tournaments are in pleasant preferences that can support the business.
In these units, the tourists receive their whole training and this is a disagreement and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainerine by Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Trainerine from Laurie Hernandez, both trained their attitudes since they started with the tour.
We need to make the municipalities unnumberable, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie allow a more readable and easier touring.
I found my 20-year-old tournament.
In my events, we have commanded free and tackle tours in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (bearingly black and Spanish) and trained national and international victors.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (My homestadt) to provide youth highqualific tours that have the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great olympic sport type.
Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and stability for the spirit.
This combination offers long-term benefits for health and school and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this mankind, which brings thousands of young girls to take interest in the direction and that's great.
It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.
That's a so exciting time.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by the woods of the olympic mankind goal and thanks, she has so many young girls with different background motivated to become their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistants want to organize further stress after they rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The Ministers had decided to end the fight on the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of those 37,000 assistants who were assigned at a choice.
In July, Hunt had designed plans to introduce the treaty and said that the NHS would be in a "Newland" and any further delay for employees and patients would be damaged.
The first assistants shall receive a new contract containing amendments to night and weekend work to improve the bonds to ungarn hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Responses, participated last night in a communication with: "Asistents have been made to the proposed treaty as seriously, particularly that it is engaged in the current responsibilities crisis and will be denied to treat all doctors right."
Only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new treaty should be made progress and take the time.
The efforts of the BMA aimed at solving conflicts through conversations are to participate in the Government on opposite and sometimes on earlidous difficulties.
This happened from a promise that Jeremy Hunt had done for the last month that his door would always be opened.
"Jeremy Hunt has to act now to lift up the resurrection and answer the concerns of the assistants."
If it does not, the assistant has clearly made that they are ready to carry further work campaigns.
The last streek end of April saw a surrounding of 13.000 routine operations and 100,000 periods, since hospitals and farmers were included in order to provide doctors on the streekpost chain discovery.
The Ministers had decided to end the fight on changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the functions of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wishes a better weekly payment for the 54.000 assistants who are submitted to the Treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS employer, requested the assistant to end the street.
Mortimer said: "The work campaigns are not reaching anything but have already overloaded teams and service providers and will prepare patients, officers and their families only worried about, needs and disappearance."
In the past two months, we have spoken to the Commission of Assistants and have responded positively to the Ministry of Health and to other Ministers on the importance of the pre-related and vital development.
Workers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as disappearance, flexibility in schools, additional education for those returning from a vocational time, educational centres, mutual recognition of the teaching plan, continued training and the badly specific loan cases in the Medicinal - were a sign of how seriously it was the employers, the health education and the Ministry of Health for the compliance with the BMA in November, and May.
The £2-pro tag medicine that can cut infarcity
A £2-pro day medication of thousands of heart-farct patients will be used after recommending that more people have been granted for a longer period.
The renaissance medication of Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart infections for people with heart disease.
The medication is reduced for 12 months after an infarct of heart, which reduces the risk of a hazardous case or another heart infarct.
The NHS regulatory Authority recommended a long-term approach to further reducing the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS regulatory Authority recommended a long-term approach to further reducing the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A number of 140,000 people each year have an infarct of heart and a quarter of them produce a further heart-infarct or a slaughter.
Infarctions and disagreements are caused by collections of fat materials in the artery walls that form the definitions.
If the belg goes out each other, it may cause an inhibition of blood flowing up to the heart and cause a infarct of heart.
When the blood wheel is solved, it can be dropped through the blood stream and cut the blood flux to the brain, which causes a blessed case.
Those who already had an infarcte have to have a higher risk.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company astraZeneca and distributed under trade name Brilic, reduces this risk by making it uncertainly obvious to the education of blood tubercules.
The NICE, which has been published today, recommends a 12-month adoption of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg, with a two-year acceptance of aspirin for the next three years.
Prof. Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "For the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have earned a heart infarct, a further heart-infarct or a slagan case - often consequences with the deströse."
The fear of a new heart infarct may have significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
The experience shows that Ticagrelor is effective in combination with aspirin in reduction of further heart-infarctures and disagreses in people who already had an infarct of heart.
By an provisional recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are glad that we are in a position to expand available treatment options to thousands of people that can benefit from it.
The information on the effectiveness and security of Ticagrelor – especially the blooding risk - is limited to a period of up to three years. The guidance project recommends no treatment that goes over this period.
Cultural culture of political correction allows electricity to solve muslimic areas
The former citizen of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was the last year to appoint a government report on corruption from the office
A political correctness culture has made that widely widely widespread electoral pressure in Muslim communities is scientificly ignored as an offensive government report today.

The former Minister for Integration and Communalization, who now is an attractive corruption, said that the damage of electors from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to establish countries outside the elections to protect the electoral.
He recommends that electors should lead an exhibition with themselves to demonstrate their identity in the elections.
Today, a elector must only call his name and address.
The report proposes that the not-defined rate of a person should be put on the fingers of a person when they are deemed to decide to prevent someone to choose two times.
Sir Eric says the skills should be more protected.
He calls for the press to have more access to communities and decisions from non-official commissions or working groups.
"There is not only against election abuse, but also to protect the common government from the widely wide corruption and financial fraud culture," he said.
The report was ordered by the Downing Street as a follow-up of the Tower Hamlets election channels in East London.
Last year, a special election order decided that the official citizen Lutfur Rahman had to be corrupted and illegal practices of his office should be enthusied.
The court felt that Rahman had transformed the religious feelings of his muslim community" in a zinc way" and that he had caused his criticians with racissmus and islamophobian accused.
Rahman must "her campaign has been conducted on the basis that it is the religious obligation of muslims to select him."
Before 300 voices were certainly or the consequence of a submergement, where a person was chosen as someone else.
Sir Eric said that it was in all the country's evidence for fraude.
In particular, he expressed alarming to the election of a depressive letter - the elder members of the Muslim Community had been made on people to select a candidate of their election.
Sir Eric, deployed, made several recommendations to use the selection system, including the guide of instructions to demonstrate the identity
In his report, it states: "If evidence was made that pressure on protected members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised, particularly women and young people, to choose, in accordance with the will of the elders, in particular with Pakistan's or Batladean background.
"It was aware that... state institutions would have ignored this behaviour because of "political corrections" superfinances concerning Ethiopia and religious religion.
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to use the system, including the prohibition of editing the political active letter selection documents to stop the "Cherents".
The report taken by Theresa May is also requested for a stronger registration review to prevent the selection directory to immigration and social frogs.
Take into account options to ask electors before selecting after your exhibition.
Use not discoverable tits on the finger of a person when she has decreased her voice to prevent someone to choose two times.
Systematic verifications on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are authorised.
A three-year limit on applications to a automatic selection.
Prohibit that the political activityists to edit full elections and exchange of letters.
The police will grant the power to establish elections stations.
A change of legislation that facilitates an appeal for the deployment in accordance with the representative of the People's Act 1983 (Volk Republication Act).
Photo delay in selection stations.
Requests that only can be used English in the election stations (except Wales).
Increased training in order to ensure that employees make the rules to go alone into the electoral chabine.
Sir Eric flood the Metropolitan police and finds it "sounded," that after the Tuber Hamlets, there was no crimes.
"The election office has explained Lutfur Rahman and his representative for a Lithuania because of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
A number of reasons for sufficient - in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings - was accurately known.
He also criticizes the uneffective "abhak controls" of the election registration departments of the Rath Houses.
Sir Eric said, "The Court of Justice in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of the parliament, is a delicate heritage, but the expansion of the election and the deployment of some authorities affect this good appeal.
Drop to Kates Radler doubledler and other famous doubles of Olympiasporters in Rio
The Olympiade 2016 in Rio, this week, about the French Radsportles Pauline Ferrand-Prevot outside the border and the band, which has shown himself as an impressioning duplicant duplicant of the Herzogin of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old olympionikin is not this summer, at any time, the only one to fight gold, which demonstrates its own doubles - at least not if you can give the social media faith.
To honor the Olympian games in Rio and all the famous faces that flew on our screens at the time, FE Germany has created a list of olympionics that show more than just a certain identity with Hollywood workshops.
The Jäger and the Wolf: Member of the US manager in the bogen shape Brady Ellison, left, is compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Besides Kate's double duplicant on the radar railway, many people in the Internet showed how a certain booms could be the guns of the guns of A-promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
The manager of the US manager in the bogen shape Brady Ellison has caused a tour on Twitter after the pictures he looked in secretly on the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the woods of the booms met the rain in the social media and gave him to hear from his childhood that he looked like Leo.
"I don't see myself great accuracy, except the face reward," participated Brady of the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-speaking guy, so I'm supposed to do it as compliance."
One of the most favourite comparisons since London will be unfortunately further in the middle point of 2012: the identity between the British Weitspringer Greg Rutherford and the popular player Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian Turnerin Aliya Mustafin with its large, expressed eyes to be doubled for the Cuban-American Sänger Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African Swimming Cameron from the Burgh is compared with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
A higher Gang: This user is thinking Nathan is the "athletic version" of the initial player
Another closer comparison was taken between the tennisstar Rafael Nadal and the player Josh Hartnett, which appears similarly grave eye and lips.
The Russian silverme-medeleumum Yulia Efimova shows more than the dreamed hair and blow hairs like the player Annalyn McCord, while the American Nathan Adrian of Fans was tested to the same “athetical version of Joseph Gord Levitt”.
Star women: footballstar Hope Solo, left, and right player Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar form and eyes
Not the only: a Twitter user was very happy that others were also affected.
Theory placed in the room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the identity of the couple
One Twitter user explained her satisfactory that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are nearly identical."
In fact, the US-Fußballstar Hope Solo and the right player Jennifer Carpenter have a incredibly similar form and eyes.
Another comparison includes Kerri Walsh-Jennings and its lumps nearly with the player Laura Linney and the goldmedale memory in the turns of Gabby Douglas, which shows its own wonderful, widely laughings like Bring Il Star Gabrielle Union.

The critics against Byron MacDonald came fast and hard to Twitter, with which many talked to him.
Twitter users didn't turn back when they heard how insensible Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like rassists. # Join.
Soon later Scott Russel, who was moderated by the CBC Sending, lived for the comment of MacDonald and said: "We apologize that the comment was expensed on a weak performance."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, I'm sorry that it happened."
CBC appealed at the end of 90 times for people who have responded to the note on Twitter
The commentary colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC copied and added his excuse to more than 90 other Twitter users that had been assessed on MacDonald's comments
The network was also rapidly excused and gave a communication.
We are desperate that these explanations were made and that they were allowed to be exposed.
We have quietly excused our social media at last night with our viewers to send and our followers.
To clarify that Byron's comments focused on the performance of the weak and not on them as a person.
However, they were unemployed and unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron does what he said, very sorry.

"I would like to take a time to apologize for the comment I made after the female crash in the CBC Olympisation exposure, he said.
"I was on the performance of the weak and not on them as a person."
Of course, there was no misunderstanding and I'm very sorry."

A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who had been caught at the same time in the business, said that after the mystery woman tried to the subsequents, " she turned back and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "The people couldn't believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sale she took a couple of subhoses from the exhibition, cut off their own flowers and hooks and tried them.
"It didn't even try to find something more discreet place to do it - she was just standing there, freaking like Oscar."
"Every smoke when she turned out the hooks that hadn't seen it clearly, since she put her back into the regulation."
She repeated the same with three other subshotes before she finally decided that she was not pleased to get back and gone again.
"You don't seem to be ashamed that she observed someone -- or thinking of the person who would buy the subhoses that she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33 who lived in the city, said, "What opposite to think someone would take a home who had bought another person and who didn't have been shot."
The case occurred on Sunday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: "What I have agreed, the employees have tried to put the clothes out of the sale after she went - what is exactly good."

A speaker of Primark said: "Premark is the case of the event who learned on Sunday, 9 August in our Philippe in Folkstone."
All products in question were taken from the sale.
How to protect you with Krav Maga from weapon attacks
The world is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com can make it more secure for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Containers in New York, to find how to move closely to disappearance with armed rabbits.
Independent of whether you can be closed by front or downwards, this video will show you how to move your roof.
If you're close to you down, then you'll have to be around as the first, so you can see your careers and "Sich from the shopping line," says Mizrachi.
Then take the weapon between your front armor and your shot before smile him with your free ellips.
Put him soon with the knee into the pit and dismiss you while the pain crystal together, the weapon out of his hands. Put him with the rock into the face and move back, while they put the gun on him.
In the event of the detrimentation that is close to the front, the technology is similar - move your body out of the line, take the weapon and displace it, so that the anger can not appear.
At the same time displace the weight on the gun and push the anger on the bridge, then drop the gun out of his wheel before they move back and put the gun on it.
Klingt difficult?
See the video to see exactly how Mizrachi formed.
But think that it's the most sure to overcome your money - unless you are no Krav Maga grandmaster.
Relator Ian Wright has shot his language in the most delicate places of Europe
A British traveller understood its immun system and flower flow of a serious trial by discovering some of the most smooth and unique places of Europe.
The Modern Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shot his wages on a Euro shot, a country on Piccadilly Circus, a peak button and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immunity system.
Before the opening of each object he used a light-meter to show us what he would be used.
But the experiment, which was filtered under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprised results to daylight.
The thought to disappear the scroll button of a plugtoilette that has already been used by thousands of others may be absolutely abstracted, but actually, in a kitchen school, the worse bacteria.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical officers on the promotion of Darmachines and on his own health.
Successfully, he left nothing that he had hidden, more than a bad afternoon in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known to test the oppositeability of his affairs by he had gone through the world, own and wonderful things.
From public countries to train boards to the skills of toiletes, the task made its immun system definitively under a test
In the film he told: "Every as a child, I was relatively uncertain about what is about my health and I've stored all possible things in my mouth, the earth, the ramp and the water."
In the film, he was just just in every case.
The only thing he refused was a dream public toilette in Russia.
His Probebstrich showed a Luminometer number of more than 4000 units.
In comparison with this, the number of fresh hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilette that he refused to disappear, after the number of more than 4000 units, while fresh smoking hands showed one of less than 60.
Mr Wright and the Finnish producers of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the bathroom number in different places such as the bathroom
In the film he says, "This is the worst thing I've shot in a toilette, nearly."
There's nothing worse than that!
I'm not gonna touch here because it's easy inside here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the finnish producer of milk products Valio.
The company provides Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains milk bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support Darmbacs and Immun Systems.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Snacks and New Category Niko Willenmaa says, "We wanted to offer the consumers to really something new.
Something that is fascious to view and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotica.
We've led to swear breathtakings that ended that we said, "Let's call us Ian."
They say that the interest in harm health will be in a global phenomenon
Instead of talking to the products, we wanted to put it in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our entire environment, the importance of harm health and how it is linked to the immun system.
The growing interest in harm health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film, we could provide more information on the consumer in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense for humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the film regime, added: "Let me say that-- I had lost my respect for Ian, if he had read some of the things I have shown to lay down him, just like the simple Russian toilette that is shown in the film."
Of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to clothe it and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we've taken some of these ridiculous leckers on the film."
In a survey carried out by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all requested milk bacteria, particularly with the profit of mass and Darm and 58 percent said they were at least used for products containing the milk bacteries added.
Asocial Family Destructed before Delogation Social Women in Saltash, Cornwall
A asocial family left their social accommodation after dislocation with a damage of $50,000 because she had terrorised her neighbourhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were sent after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were strongly disappeared from their ownership, the shocked officers of the apartment had the property in an unparable state.
The walls argued the legs, the woods were pushed, the mull was spread on the foot tree, and the graffiti was strucked on the walls.
The family has been killed and it will be accepted that she lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who worked for the house manager at Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the apartment wasn't repairing anymore.
She said, "It was for people here a absolute living room, and I think people don't have to live in this way.
There are many things to take into account because this property is probably not such a beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is appreciated and her call is also.
The couple had three children who lived interimly in the apartment and told the police that the terrorist, which had added the family, covered road combats with Baseballs, injuries of residents, drug abuse, drug trade and extraordinary drugs, stripes and floods.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the Middle Treaty, received a regulation for anti-social behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house that will be disappeared under circumstances, an old mull was found
There were in the residence in which drugs were treated in the past to remove wood diamonds
Neighbors said they were seen fighting on the street and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing discovered her and her partners this week of the property after she gave them a long period of 11 weeks to leave voluntary.
The delogation was made by easy neighbors who said that their life was made to hell.
One said, "They were smoking for no one."
We lived 20 years next to them, and it was always bad.
The unnumerable times we say the police here are incredible.
"We couldn't sleep today."
We got up because it was so quiet here -- we're not living!
Now, where they're finally away, it'll be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Force Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it had been to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police had been called in regular cases, 20 years
To the overwhelmed side of the municipal house, Mull and old games were thrown down
He added: "It's a shame that the middle has denied to receive any responsibility for their behaviour and their family, since a delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into account.
This was a very difficult case, since the behaviour was extremely and their doings for their neighbors had to be angry.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and the members of the community, who are strongly accessed to us and have granted the information to us.
I hope that this development will depend on some neighbouring troops and report the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in different times in the house, but they were all over 20.
A smooth matrat that was left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation on the ground
Workers of the house manager will now be needed to break down Mullberges that make the house
2014, the police took a razzia into the house and found more than 70g Cannabis as well as weapons, paraphernalians and barriers higher than $1.700.
Skeldon received a cash after she had known the owner of a drug of the class B in trade view.
She stated that the money for a grave of her son Lee Skeldon, which came in 2013 in a car accident around life.
After they were without obedying, Tanya and her partners are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room rooms in the house were designed with graffiti.
The police says she'll be delogated by Mieter who do not keep the house regulation
Angela Crow by the police of Devon and Cornwall reported that the delogation is a clear warning to the other middle which does not keep the house regulation.
"This is about those who think that they can take themselves without self-respection and those who have been injured by such a behaviour," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that continues to work with partners to protect our communities.

Donald Trump dreams ◆ ◆ Management Problems ◆ в the chosen box
The leading of the US Republics is based on massive concerns, including in traditionally conservative states.
President-candidat Donald Trump now gave the weaknesses of his electoral campaign in the present Republic Utah.

After he threw 16 rivales within his own republic camp out of the rain, he now grows the doubt of his success in the fight for the white house.
"We have strong problems in Utah," Trump said before evangelical Christians he was to support in major states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
He was injured to be false reports about his candidate, he took again his known media cells.
Republican Evidents wackel
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Republic.
A surveyUSA's survey from June, Trump and his competitors from the Democrates, Hillary Clinton, were in the same way.
Other Institutes do not, however, see Trump, but not with the distance usually for revolutionary candidates in the Federal State.
As dangerous, Arizona and Georgia are also applicable.
In an interview of the sender CNBC said Trump to the question, how he's to stop the premarce Clinton again: "Genause, as I have done so far."
And slow behind: this will be "before successful, or I'll make a very beautiful, long holiday."
He doesn't do anything else than "to tell the truth."
If it is in the end of reasons of political correction, it is okay, it said Trump further.
Then I'll return to a very good way of life.
According to the press reports, the party Trump had to encourage money to support its choice campaign, it should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead of this, the candidates of the Republics are to be stronger for the Congress.
Olympia: Thirdry drug in Doping steel
The IOC wishes to establish a discipline committee on the case.
Kenia's Level Atlantics takes place after the second Doping Office at the Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro Ungehemach.
After an investigation of drugs at a Doping Control in the Olympic village, Kenia sent a train to the house.
The International Olympic Committee participated in the preparation of a discipline committee to investigate the case.
A Kenya functioner had reported that the former Sprinter and today Coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympic village, had an urine test in the name of Ferguson Rotich.
This is the team guide Kenia's reported from the Doping Controls.
IAF World Trade requested IOC information on the case to expand its own investigations, a IAAF speaker participated.
"Independent of the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC, IAF will take an evaluation," said it in an IAF declaration.
"He (Anzrah) went to the Doping Controll station and expressed himself as Ferguson Rotich, the test and signing," said Kenias Chief of the Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in the possession of the accreditation of the Atler who was on the list of training controls of the World Anti Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich was in 2015 in Peking WM Valleyer over 800 meters.

This could have been demonstrated that in this type of sports it was added to systemically.
Russia's light-effects were excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side History" with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare-Jar, the Salzburger's festival plays the "West Side History" with Tony and Mary as tragic love couple, such as Rom and Julia.
This is a surprised Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical erobert Salzburg: the "West Side History", Leornard Bernsteins Masterwerk.
The artistic leader Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classic and fulfilled the role of Mary a youth triumph.
In the Orchester grave, Samón Bolívar Orchester is the Gustavo Dudamel guide: "This music is full of rhythm," he urged.
We're always saying she's very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their time and melody.
It's a wonderful mixture, the perfect reception for our orchester.
I'd say we have Bernstein music really in our blood!
In this instance Bartoli plays a older Maria.
She remembers her love with Tony while she plays and danced.
The role of Mary has always fashioned me.
First because she's extraordinary musical!
And then the personality of Mary would be there.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so beautiful, I feel pretty and white and bright."
It is so wise, of course also native, and very passional.
"She likes me very, my Italian character I have as Roman," said Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the farmer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such a honour to work with her.
She's an unfair man.
And Bartoli reiterates the complement: "Dudamel is so an extraordinary artist and very harmful."
Direction is a need for him.
See it in every of his movements, in his look, it's his life!
It is so a great opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a highest south temperature, a fire, a suffering, and also a joyful starting way to life, which is most important!
For the American Register Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" highlighted: "In this piece it goes about prejudices and fanatics."
Today, we were the refugees, at the same time, the Puertoricans went to New York, and the New York inhabitants didn't want them.
It's the same topics, and they're today exactly outcoming as well as at the time.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.

Turkey: Cordian community rechnet with mass flights
"Whoever doesn't adapt and dwell in Erdogan, sits on packed coffee," said the President of the Good-Noth Stifting dialogue and the world, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish community of Germany is a short time with ten thousand protector visitors flighting from Turkey to Germany.
A mid-term could even be "one hundred thousand" believed by the President of Ali Toprak.
By the hard action of the Turkish President Recep Tayika Erdogan after the Puts' investigation, the Korean community is expected to have a mass flight to Germany.
"I continue to fight the minorities and democratic opposition with some hundreds of thousands of protection visitors from Turkey in Germany when the Erdogan Regime continues to combat minorities and democratic opposition," said the Congress President Ali Toprak of the World on Friday.
Since the Government has already been overcome with Strategy months ago, 500,000 currencies were in Turkey to flee.
After the resolved push, there are no sculture and oppositional ethnic ports.
Many people will want to start again in Europe when they will continue to be pressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a State who takes himself refugees produces refugees in their own country," said Toprak.
The board accused the targeted Syrian Arabian residence in Koreans, but also in alevitian cities.
In order to increase the pressure to the remaining courses, Erdogan wants to increase the pressure.
"They are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been scattered or destroyed in the past hundreds of years", said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The Federal Governor requested that the Federal Government was "so sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his attachers".
In Germany he also found a "Hexenjagd" criteria against Erdogan.
I don't feel sure in the last months.
The German duty of the good movement also fears the flight of many tourks in the outside.
More tours will be searched for Asyl in Germany, especially curdens and oppositionles.
The brandmark as good addendums destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.
"Whoever doesn't adapt and dragge Erdogan, sits on packed cuts, otherwise also the cemasters and sakulars," said Ercan Karakoyun, President of the Good-No-Stifizing dialogue and education, "the world".
As reported on the numbers of the Federal Minister of Internal Ministers, Turkey have already made the largest group of the political persecution recognized asylum officials in Germany.
On June 30, 11.386 people were 11.386 people, so that 29 percent of all were as an asylum recognized (39.625).
In this exemption, the war, poverty or perspective flowers are not found.
Asylum authorities under the basic law are exclusively politics, i.e. from State side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Poosters: "Where you go, where it's laughing"
Setting Mecklenburg formmers: The homeers will not receive anything from the summer bathroom - and the vacants from the northern-Westfails can not choose the countryday.
In Mecklenburg, they understood.
2021 The Land Day election will not be held directly at the end of the summer feast, but the Swiss Parliament has decided to begin the year.
For blow as far as it doesn't happen: summer feasts, hotze and ground selection campaign - it's seen.
The homes that are to be convinced by the elector warrants are in the holiday.
The alleged vacants who are in the country, on usedom, rivers or hidden water are not home, so they cannot choose the country Day.
For this reason, practical problems: in the holidays, the plastics are helping to fit the plates, break up the balls, disseminate flyers and say at the end of the voices, only to be comfortable.
To September 4, 2016, the election and last festival, Mecklenburg-Vorpommers must still be elected to the people.
The sound phase when you can say that, it's just started.
And it is also about something: President Erwin Sellering, manager of a SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, since 1998, is now clear in surveys behind the CDU.
It is slow, how strong Neuling AfD is cut down, and what remains at the end of coalition date.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 government heads, makes a nearly uncomfortable election campaign, are seen from his grandplakats.
He traveled through the country, divided roses and dismissed a bit with people, as he also did his lensive prejudice Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, animation has received cold feet and gives the curioses Merkel the fault at the flowing of the AfD.
Their refugee policy, you "We create this" has accelerated the rise of the legal populations, which is likely to cost him now the beautiful office.
The CDU with its skills, Minister Lorenz Cfier, has already experienced, as if you're doing the wrong time in the right place of choice.
It has two times invited Angela Merkel to large results; Merkel Federday selection crystal is located in the north East.
But the target group did not correct, there were more northrhein-Westfalls, Berlin and Sachsen as mecklenburgers and pre-pommers.
"There was likely the majority of other federal countries," Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg Warmers, recently in the NDR.
But there is no one of the other eggs of Germany to hear sometimes Angela Merkel.
On the other hand, the North-Ost-Orient CD is far away on the usual electoral sites on market sites and before sale centres with sun-screens and airballs.
This, mean cokert, only plays a "subjected role".
The Union also noted that you're encouraging the base on the country that it must be very strong to find a dragon to people again.
You are like the left, the SPD, the green: in the street of the country.
However, the CDU fighter Council is also self-deployed: "You must go where weep, where people are: villages, golden weddings, every birthday must be used."
Because much on the game, Sellering has now called his SPD to a specially involved choice camp.
In questions, social democrates are last 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and only before the AfD (19).
In the election of 2011, the SPD was still clear to 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Green, small party with seven percentages in the surveys, should create the spring in the countryday.
They make a modern tagend from the Ferien Not and make their choice large parts in the Internet.
"Online-Wahlkampf," it is called the country Presidency Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, the green electoral arms will be seen on searching for an domestic smokers among the vacants.
Silke Gajek, the Swiss candidate, runs just with a household through the Mecklenburg Sea and finds it well.
Its impression: "Base Holiday in Mecklenburg, no crime."
B27-Scanning: Guests lead to explosion
At the speed with the B 27, there is nothing to megar.
For the responsible of the construction work that begins at 5.30 p.m. and end before 20 hours, there's a lob everywhere.
"They have done everything very funny," Elvira Tetzlaff says.
That's a super team.
There is no relationship.
The building could at the beginning of the week start to half time planned to south until the end of October is completed.
The benefit of the responsibilities of the construction work will also be granted, as well as the establishment of aid accident.
Since the construction was changed on Monday to south, the speed of the Asperg Street was up in Ofterdingen and the connection to Rottenburg was also resolved within the place.
The citizens are now able to recover the B 27 in each other.
It seems to be back through the place.
"There was partly important complaints," said the head of Florian King for the traffic management of sanitation.
The inhabitants of baggage roads, stone last roads, hair roads and Weizerrain had to fight with more transportation, because many of them were looking for shopping ways and more than their nive trusted than the deterioration.
What has resulted in some of the lkws in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not contained, the community requested strengthening the vehicle from mountings.
"It was a significant override," says King, "who seemed to be expert at the place of the situation.
There have been two to three per minutes.
The fastest was 77 hour kilometres in the time-30 scene.
Since the building has continued, it has become quiet.
For business officers at B 27, it is only a small trend that for customers from Rottenburg now is the road open.
Look at the cards do not like business leaders.
But that the B 27 scene has led to them overseas, it allows everyone who is asking to see.
However, some more and some are less affected.
He who has less produced to do with the "Endkunt", so for other companys he has not been purified.
It also said to the car House Maier, Thomas Sulz of a "est easy back", but also finds that "the course is missing" is also one.
The locals are the most strongest in the street.
J. Albert Göhner, Inhabitant of the Steakhouse, previously Krone, finds clear words.
It's already threatened.
Not only him, but all guests have met it "hart".
The customers were missing from hechingen, ballings and rottweil.
We must be happy about each euro transfer.
The exchange rates are associated with "more than 50 percent".
The road sanitation has backed its operation "to two years".
The half of his employees had to leave.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released, the policy would have reacted otherwise.
Instead, President of the Government, Jörg Schmidt has made a question of divine if it could make a financial comparison, with the comment that the guests benefit other than the benefits of the situation at B 27. Now, it should also take the benefits that are given by the santion.
God knows about other landscapes, where something greater has been managed.
At all the camps, gods are sure that his guests will continue.
Finally, the family business has been located here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
The other tribes now are less predicted because of the complicated transport guide, it can understand.
If you can't go, it's very nice.
That returns his trim-client after the end of the sanitation work, the gods have no doubt.
Despite the crisis with BSE and the bird-group, gods have the impact of the B 27 jobs on their customers for the greatest crisis that has experienced his guests in his long-year history.
Six months of construction, that's pretty brutal.
In the name of terrorism, it is constantly punished to laws.
Following the recent attacks, the Minister of Maziière now provides a dick security package.
But what's a duration status to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say to all that?
Thomas de Maizière gives the rewarder.
All its proposals are to the coalition partner "politically useful", says the Federal Minister in the presentation of its new security package.
They call no one.
Others would first be discussed within the parties.
I'm also involved in this.
As an internal ministry, he is placed on results and on a "effective consensus" within the coalition.
The Maziière has allowed a little time after recent attacks in Würzburg and its request before he presented its conclusions for security in the Republic.
But now they are more widely.
Some are already known, announced, implemented: that a new security authority should take care of communication encrypted cockets is not new.
Not even the fact that Germany needs to apply several EU standards to air gas data and weapons.
The call for more video supervising and personal for the security authorities is also not surprised.
In part, the Maizière starts a second approach to proposals that have not been to do with the SPD until: he wants to set the sympathy sympathy for terrorist groups under criminality and dschihadists with double governments the German creations.
"They will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU screens.
He still holds this for useful and asking nothing to do with the coalition partner without any opportunity.
A few new ideas also presented the Maizière.
They have it partly in themselves: it plants rapid procedures for disappearances and more opportunities to arrest people before the disappearance.
Foreign flighters who are aimed in the country should before check their smartphones and open social media accounts for security testing.
In durations for disappeared asylum providers, he wants to make some worse than until - such as acts of criminals or to leave their papers to disappear their identity.
Some of them is political and fairly crazy.
Some still do not work out and allows questions open.
And in some points, for example, the question is: what is actually to do with security and terror?
Yes, the Maizière says that it is important to distinguish between the topics of refugees and terror.
But it is not possible to imagine that the attractors of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
Many people also were concerned about the high number of refugees.
And the things that humans were too deeply occupied have not yet been explanated in the elections time.
The internal security is extremely affected in the focus.
First of the suggestions in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The insurance is great.
And yes, there are choice wars.
The Union and SPD are therefore increasingly putting into consideration the internal security to the issue.
During the past days, it was high among the two parties.
First of all, a warm fight on the establishment of the Federal Police, then on a secure political collection of some ministers of the Union, in which the Resort Chapter also requires a Burka prohibition and a return from the dual government.
The Maizière also needs to be a disappointed gentlemen.
He doesn't hold anything from a dual return.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
You're not smart to start again, you're not smart.
And in a Burka Prohibition, he has constitutional obligations.
Whether its own package is at all eggs of constitutional festival and whether it's actually "aboundable" for the coalition partner, it must only be shown.
There's some in, what could provide for war.
However, the SPD is also trying to profile internal security on the subject.
Particular Sigmar Gabriel is reported once more careful conversation preparation and says: "The SPD is ready to speak about everything that is intended to increase security."
People's car's still past slowly.
Despite these channels, the delivery numbers of worldwide increase.
But not in all markets it goes around.
The calling action is active for a decision.
People's car starts in the second half-year period.
Although Europe's largest automobilisator is in the past year, although it is possible to demonstrate a further increase in its many brands and some markets in good markets.
However, in July, the Kernmark VW in particular in Western Europe shot back to the total sales, as shared in the Dax's notified company.
The VW brand was sold in July with 449100 cars 1.8 percent of cars less than in the previous month.
The sales are 14 percent under the previous month.
In the home market Germany, the delivery is almost a segment.
Marken sales officer Jürgen Stackmann took the worst numbers from July, especially at two sales days at least in Europe.
In addition, it has been retained in some nuclear markets by "changed economic frameworks".
Besides the situation around Turkey, a speaker has also deployed the British vote for exemption from the EU.
In the U.S., where the abgasaffs were first screened, there is also a minimum of books.
Great VW support is the Chinese market.
In total, the mainly affected housemark of the lower stocks without further slowly through the thisl canal: after the first seven months, a minimum of delivery is of 0.9 per cent to 3,37 million vehicles.
Concern distributors Fred Cappler was able to provide further sales from January to July.
1,3 percent of more cars delivered people's cars in this time, worldwide 5,904 million.
People's car managed with a software abgas test.
Everyone in Germany calls VW around 2,5 million cars to retain the workshops.
The VW stated that the reconstruction of the cars had no negative impact in the period of the conversion.
No disagreement of the vehicles after receipt of the vehicles, CO2 emissions or motor vehicles.
The engineer provides the customers a "garantie comparable" certificate, but don't speak of a "garantie", as it was called on Friday in business crisis.
The reason is to be legal.
The "Focus" had reported, the Volkswagen guaranteed its German customers now a guarantee for the surrounded model.
This would have confirmed the past Monday VW representative in the Federal Transport Minister.
The ministry of transport was confirmed that this meeting was.
"VW has completely fulfilled my investigation Committee and the KBA."
"Attention is not accepted," said the Federal Minister of Federal Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU).
VW has recognized the guarantee that, in the use of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor vehicles, there are no damages after the equipment and have been unchanged any type-related vehicle values.
People's car itself uses the word "garantie" but not as it is called in business crisis.
In the wide term "Garantie" the possibility of people's cars, for example, a half year after the reconstruction of some of the motor chain to a workshop - and this could be able to return to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do so.
The customer interest is also important to avoid that there are other damages that have nothing to do with the Abgascandal for a safeguard in terms of possible guarantees.
So VW does not use the word "garantie".
The Raiffeisen bank Gmund requires rich stories of future criminals - as the second Institute in Germany.
Head Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's just about 139 customers who park 40 million on Giro or a day pay account."
The Federal Union of German Banks speaks of a particular case and does not see a sign: Normal Spare must "not fear to pay for their Spanish crime".
Lower banks money over the night at the European Central Bank (ECB) must pay them 0.4 per cent of the criminality.
This rate requires railway bank Gmund from September of private and company cottage for installations over $100,000 to Giro or daily pay accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 costs are 400 euros in the year", said Paul.
He kept for a long time 40 million euros who could be renewed by one day and couldn't be remitted.
"They are with me on the central bank account and caused 0.4 percent of the costs," said the Bank Chair.
"I can't get for every million 4000 euros."
The costs are now given after the currency principle.
The barrier is just to lay down in the trainers of the railway bank, it would be too dangerous: "I have experienced four cases, I don't need the fifth!" said the bank.
Most customers had understanding and changed in other forms.
Only few waged to other banks.
The Joint Communities Bayern stated: "The extreme monetary currency of the ECB causes significant costs to all banks."
It is not possible to take it alone, if it is "financially unable".
Some German banks have therefore increased their costs for accounting, credit cards or transfers.
The Thüring Peoples and Raiffeisenbank of Oldenburger country with its Skatbank Federal 2014 has been shots.
Michael Kemmer, Main Bank Related Chief, said: "We don't expect that private customs payments should be paid for installations, so the competition in Germany is too strong in banks and space."
A banker said, "a client that has been earliered by the owner."
"It can be the problem for a small bank," if she's looking for free money.
The 1911 Genossenschaftsbank Gmund has sets in Bad Wiessee, Rottach campaigns, Kreuth and Tegern See.
In the region there are known players, sports and enterprises.
The Genossenschafts Trade Bayern, "and now not known any other banks that calculate an exhibition rate for installations of private currencies," said Ernst.
The President of the Federal Union of the German People Banks and Raiffeis Banks (BVR), Your Frère, said to end June, "The duty to go against the private curves is very high."
The competitiveness is hard, and it was the deployment of lawyers to competitive.
The customers in Germany will not leave the width.
Destination plates: Who actually bought ball plates?
Some men, age aged, love plates.
Before selecting the commenting part to transfer it under the Pseudonym Not AlleMensamenManner olds with rare blendings, this exhibition depends on the current data.
According to YouGov, it is not to a tree in Millenniums that want to welcome the newness of physical situations but to return to Middle-Nostalgie.
Those who have bought a plate shortly are all views of the age between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely purchaser group.
There are also no hordens by Hobbysamers - it has an emotional importance: older platform buyers keep their feelings more than themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to provide only time (69% vs 66%).
But you agree the results of youGov?
If this blog had been a report in the television, I would follow the camera, while I start within a busy road in Soho, get a variety of green approaches and skills wild to stand before I stand, hold my hands and say something to say: "After, let us throw a closer look on."
So let's get a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos slowly enters its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which one independent sales were affiliated - there's just a handly fantastic platform special work.
I would probably ask the cameraman to disable the camera for the next part in which I grow up directly close to different men in such businesses and try to appreciate their age and couragency through observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I by sister Ray (Daten number: two young women, three men in medium age) in the Reckless Records (Daten number: eight male age, a woman, probably after 20) is a day because of a meeting in London and goes through business to fill the few hours.
Is he a Sammler, I ask?
"I appreciate it," he said.
I have approximately 3.000 or 4.000 plates.
These ball plates, uppered (when sent me the shot by email, I didn't follow him home), clothe the walls of his housing room.
The reason why he has such a huge number of Alben and Singles is the result of his available revenue: he is now in a position to buy plates that he could not allow himself when they appear to buy and buy again the objects he sold when he was young and satisfied.
"So many things I bought are from the late 60, early 70 that appeared when I was 11 or 12. What I probably was too young to buy them," he said.
He's true that those who bought the plates are inverted and like to bring alone time, and adds, "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
That's my lady.
Wez, 25 who worked at sister Ray also believes that many customers he's trying to meet youGov profile.
However, he also noted a new wave for people who will be influenced by the media, people who have heard about the merchand and seen seen again to buy their old plates.
Of the conversations I have conducted, people usually addressed their collection for 1998 or 1999.
The customers who sold their plates to buy themselves CDs are now selling their CDs to buy again their plates," he says.
This would explain the tree to attachers of the plate residues of a certain age.
But what is the amazing emotional importance of plates?
It is only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that platforms offer a huge community of equality infants.
According to Wez, some of the elderly customers took place on the uncontact payment system.
Some platters feel override from the digital world and want to turn back to the stability of confidenced school plates, from cases that are happy of youth memories.
"I think sometimes it may be the fill of an empty or the owner of material owners as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
It's like Sammler, and I think it's in many people.
It's a simple way to work in employment.
"We're like their social workers!" a employer fled from a platform.
A survey of ICM in April found that almost 50% of those who have bought a plate, they have not heard.
The survey also found that 41% have a plate player that they never use, while 7% of those who bought a plate does not have plate players.
To this time of the message, I would probably be very concerned while I'm working through a stage of Bosa New Compilations.
Jonny, 42, who worked at Sounds of the Universe (Datenan number: three men average age) has noted a "Trophenask" point of the Revival.
"It's not a plate player, but I'd like to buy a radio head-head plate, so that I can put it into the regulation," he said.
This is not a large percentage, but it is definitely happening.
More productive, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have plates players."
That's younger people, not old ones who first come in slowly.
Fopp, which gave the ball plates almost a whole thing, has a lower public when I'm cleaning.
There are couples around the 70, tourists, making photos, teenageageages and women in medium age.
Even though the atmosphere is some less resolved than in the previous business - Wild Beasts the newest Synthesizer and sex package Pop instead of experimental Jazz disappears from the lambs - it's good to see such a differentity in the customers.
No one of them sees along the same, but the soft psychic traumata are difficult when you stand near some 30 seconds long.
Elanora, 27, walks around a few minutes in the business and sees the vacuum of the plates that are set for sale.
She makes a screen window powder than a big buy.
You don't get a lot, so the collection of plates is no real option, she says.
It's a lot of costs.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in another way, but the beauty of plates is..." she turns out with a loved severer.
I don't know how to explain it -- it's really unique.
My last stand is a business that is said that a new generation of plate-learnings should inspire: Urban outfitters.
While I give the appearance to explore the Jean's Hotpants, I observed a group of young teenage towns that group a moment for Poloid cameras before a father and his daughter to buy a Crosley plates player.
To the left there is a train house, a wall of full plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of timely genetic music and classic music, the essential plates for an average collection.
Nobody looks at it - maybe because they are just in decorative, some are so far as far as it is impossible to take it.
It's clean "platt artist."
But, considering that any attraction for these cases mean more money for the industry and some customers could send more to the Sohos, there is nothing to make themselves.
There is no surprise that a group of population, who has more time and money than others, is also the one who is the most expensive of luxing situations such as plates.
Even though my research shows that the results of YouGov are agreed, at least they will, at least, in platforms in Soho, the large number of females and plastics that exist in reality, plates and online fores.
These people are probably hard in school or offices.
They will not take their Thursday tomorrow with security with the bummel by the Berwick Street plates and the plates with plates, while they diminish the sharp view of a false, 30-year-year-old modern, which is nothing attractive men's age.

The French Court of Justice learns about the removal of business in the Djungel Refugee
A French court has rejected a offer of the authorities in Calais, decade of provisory businesses and restaurants in the dungel of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.
In a trial negotiation this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be able to undertake 72 provisory businesses in which persons within the campaign, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, sell, sell wage services, or sell tea for 50 cent (40 cent) or self-times for some euros in provincies.
The President Calais argued that these places should be disappeared because they would present a parallel economy that would not be paid to taxes and that a fire- and health risk is mounted.
Humanitarian groups shared the court that business and restaurants were important, since the free-country periods offered by the State and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also indicated that the Provsorian business and restaurants often would offer free meal time for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the design of people who operate the 72 provincies, but found that the views of the prefector of Calais were "resolved".
The judge Jean-François Molla said that food businesses, coffee and restaurants would play a lot of greater role than just people who would approve "in extremely precise conditions."
He said that the areas of peaceful meetings between refugees and volunteers offer.
One of the places that were threatened by the layer was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated in common, 200 meal times on the day, English and French classs, and a consultation in Asylsaken for hundreds of people who are protected and uncomplied males in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the Petition to get the kids' café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said that the closure "for these children would be a catastrophe of which the last eight years have been old."
The two help organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrant appreciated on Friday that the number of lives in the dungheld has been attained to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after shared adoption of news in the summer.

Here's the power trailer.
Germany's Raser must be set to the following generation of speed measurements: In various federal countries, among others in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flower devices are being performed, and the time providers are particularly effectively translated.
The futuristic strengthening trailer of the Vitronic company from Kusbads can be used for example at accidents where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement by the police.
Examples for autoway stations or sanitary blocks with past timelimits are often not necessary infrastructures to ensure that there is a station flower for the maintenance of speed limit.
A sustainable mobile building may be too dangerous or outstanding.
The enforcement Trailer is autark: His Akku holds five days in an uninterrupted measurement operation, the case data will be transmitted through a modem.
With Laser-Mess technology, all vehicles can also be captured through several springs at the same time.
Variable speed limits as well as travel bans after hour, drives and vehicle classs are also monitored.
In high dangerous state, the producer can be moved to the addendum with each car with added adjudication.
In order to not easily be lodged, he is abolished in the mask so that the wheels in the pitcher and otherwise disappeared outside.
In addition, a constructed warning facility must protect the blogger from Vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer is served by Vitronic in various federal countries and is also implemented averagely.
Foreign authorities also flee with the new technology: recently France has requested 100 pieces after a design of 150 pieces in the past year.
Britains takes silver in 7th Rugby, after Fiji Master class Gold holt
The impressive performance of the Britain at 7th Rugby ended at the end on Thursday at a stop in the last court of the Fijis, when they were shoted with a result of 43-7 in the Goddoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji divided a master class in handling, side stepping, backwards, lines and red force to gain gold - her first olympiamedail of every color.
The removal was forbidden by the not too bad troast price of the silver medal - the fourth of the British Britain on this day - and they could be angry by their efforts in this tournament in which they shot the Neuseeland, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear decline of the boks, 7-5 in half-final on the same day, could return to them at the end.
But, independently, Fiji had killed a 15 man team in Bestform.
It could be a comfort for GB, but it will probably not be - at least one briefing tomorrow will have a gold meal around his half: Fijis Cheftrainer Ben Ryan, the former Chief for England from Wimbledon.
The GB had a difficult way behind.
Eight years ago, she lost each game with the Adelaide Sevens.
She's just lost one here.
This slaughter is hurt, but progress is great.
Fiji started wonderfully and left GB attacks from Spass.
It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if it was going to run in a bus. World Series memory went up to 5-0, as Osea Colinisau was overlooked in the egg.
With more than four minutes of game, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right egg he changed.
12-0 and GB have missed the ball.
A predominant tackle of Mitchell stopped by the mountain of Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third door, but Fiji just stopped.
In the seventeen minutes Jasa Veremalua led a touchdown in the right ecke, and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new since the restart and there was still a minute of playing... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouveou pressed by other weak boardings of the GB team and stirred up to the line to make a gate.
The movement brought a 29-0 to the suspension.
It's like Fiji was born to play seven while GB still learns.
So it's.
The GB made basic changes to half-time and concluded the physical buckets... for all four minutes, which was good for the comparisons of the first half time, until Josua Tuisova passed after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left egg for a 36-7, but the game was lost long for the South Seinsulars, whose phenomenon was blooding, fadens and danced on the tribune.
It was not difficult to consider the player approach Fijis.
Mata Viliame set the i-tops with a further attempt in the last seconds.
The Pfiff made, the fischies umberried and GB kicked smoking in the races.
Before that day, Fiji Japan had visited in half-final with 20-5 and South Africa was located in a naked half-finalmatch of the Rain - Britain Translation of the Difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boks into the first half before, but Dan Norton stopped the line with an impressioning footwork and made a gate under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant tackling later by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the winner - and thus the silver meal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning by the fight with the trainer cancer on the rudershieg
There will be no more emotinan gold than these games and it will be called.
From the first step to the last, 220 hard hive entered into the story, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Stacio da Lagoa.
Even though there were only the two settled on the ruder, there were three voices in the boat. The Echo of Trainers Robin Williams was widening when they were on the second olympiad in the second, without tax flower, the first women in the history of the British sports, who put such a measure table.
Her Dominanz was absolutely, while her 39th unproposed use, which is also unspeakable.
What we see are two brilliant athletes, who engage over the surface with the eleganz of swimmings, which does not reflect the type of triumphs to galles.
Besides each gold in the road, a bacteloon sets for voluntary helpers that contribute to the incredible progress that makes the difference and it was no one more comprehensive than the trainer that didn't know whether he would survive this day above than cancer was diagnosed with him.
As he said, he was riskant.
I had Blasenkrebs, who's coverable and they did it.
If you don't do that, he's gonna spread everywhere.
It would be a very bad situation.
It's a little changed the view.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio had the luck that he had been treated beginning 2014, outside the saison, could start what the interruption had kept at a minimum, if it was under such circumstances in all the right sense.
I needed money, so I had to get better again.
It was a breathe.
I was in the hospital and walked on the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient.
So it begins.
The ruler on themselves is already a challenge, but it makes it more.
In the inevitability of the victory, their first thoughts were to Williams, who had spent a nervous morning to speak more than another and thus tried to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a chief man in the Royal Artillery Register in a use in Afghanistan, said, "I was this week an emotional wrack. This may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much this means how many I and Helen have worked and also Robin.
There were three wonderful years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so it's a massive thanks to him.
I couldn't want a better person to teach or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost races in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their gentlemen couldn't keep.
Even in the latest 500 metres when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began, Stanning and Glover were too many in reservation.
We were very arrested at the moment.
Helen called "Back in the process, stay in the process."
It is really important to do so.
We had a good start, and at the same time we were not going to make something tonight.
We wanted no firework today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, out and gain the rains that we did.
The couple will take a time for a year before it takes decisions on its future.
Glover needs to appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV agent Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that's my last road.
That would mean too much pressure.
It was about six months in London to understand that I was an olympicizer.
It was so new for me, and I was so scared.
This is about four minutes.
"It feels so better," she said.

Stahl - Light views for German Stahl industry
The crises and intensive energy industry remains in millions of additional costs.
Financial charges from the industry from the Economic Promotion are from the table.
It remains in exemption from the renewable energy location in the documents for the so-called pro-protein production in the German steel industry, said the Federal Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westestest General Journaling" (WAZ, Friday expenditure).
"I'm really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years."
The European Commission had first planned to make the steel producers use the gases from the highest for the production of the own consumption to be requested for the cash.
The steel industry has resulted in additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel said that it was a principle of agreement with the EU Commission on discussions with the Competitive Commission Margrethe Vestager.
First of all, if the generators are replaced in the steelworks, a EEA is 20 percent.
But it will not be increased in the steel industry.
The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on the proper production.
This will be described by the state Quo of the present regulation.
The success of Gabriel's efforts for the steel industry has been particularly important.
"In respect to our campaign "Stahl is future" this is a first step.
"We need to follow others."
"As for the reform of emission laws, climate and employment objectives are declined," IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann said in Frankfurt.
The steel flower in Europe has resulted since the 2008 financial crisis under overcapacity and a significant price pressure.
Last year, the situation continued to disappoint the world's largest producer of China in view of the weakest home demand on the world market.
European manufacturers throw Chinese Stahl Concerts Priceduleping.
During this spring, the situation has been relaxed.
In other cases, import duties shown that have been changed to steel imports, the economic perspectives in China have increased.
It is unlawful how sustainable price reward is.
The German Branchenprime Thysenkrupp was pretty on Thursday.
Lastly, the prices would have been laid down again.
The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further costs.
Thysencrupp would not finally exclude the closure of individual works.
In the German steel industry, about 86,000 were employed in the end of 2015.
In July, the German steel producers continue to be careful, despite increased prices and increased orders.
They produced with 3,4 million tonnes well six percent of road steel less than in the previous month, as shared the economic steel on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the produced quantity now returned the second month after each other.

Community, spirit, health: Singen Do Senioren good
The Singen has already joined her whole life: As a young girl was in the school, she in the Lehramt Studium she visited the Fach Music, and today the 78-year-olds in a senior Chor.
"Singen moves me - emotional and physical," she describes.
After a trial, she feels compared, joyful and generally alive, she says.
Instead, she makes something good for her health and their spirit.
Because Singen is equal to several perspectives a great Hobby for Senioren, says Erhard Hackler of the German seniorenliga.
Most seniors sing in the Chor and share the joy of the music, described Hackler.
With the regular joint, senior social contacts can clone and close.
Because often the social and family structures in the age are solved, a choice is then an ideal opportunity to bring time with other people.
This experience has also made Urissel Kipp in her choice: "I want to answer and organize to leave the others and to learn from each other - a choice is a very special form of the cohesion."
Singen can be encouraged in positive sense, mean Hackler.
Because the seniors train a deep and controlled attempt.
He who regularly calls his lunge is not so quickly from the pust.
Even if it is about to get the sound of the voice in the age, Singen is an optimal hobby.
For older people, Singen has a very special effect, Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of the Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, the common song had a greater value of places, it was part of every day, both in school and in the free time, she explained.
Lenz is often observed that the songs or hearings of tenders in older people have many memories, often related to positive feelings of their youth.
By liedtexts and particularly melodys, deeply diseased people have a long recurrent event.
In the singen, the head is also required for special performance, Lenz.
At the same time, concentrate on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other scenariors, which is a great cognitive challenge.
Some older people who live alone do not only concentrate on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that you're encountered by the songs in the Chor means Hackler.
A well-known audience is a great lob.
The self-valuation feels also increased by the singing in the Chor.
To show yourself: If I'm doing long for something, I'll better wake out of me -- this experience strengthens.
Good reasons to start with the singen, so there's enough.
Whoever wants to trial a new hobby shouldn't throw - even if he mean to have a little talent, he's ruined Lenz.
You don't sing alone - for 50 hundred people, who hears there when a sound goes down?
On the search for the appropriate offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
If anybody is known in a senior synchronism, you can easily be closed.
Many towns also offer supervisions on the Critories in the area.
Whoever wants to singen in a kirch Chor can directly turn to the church or the predecessor of the church.
Many senior audiences are also found on the Internet.
If you don't have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors may ask for help in the Internet search.
Whoever love has to sing, should be closed to a chore, rôse Hackler.
Singen makes the soul good and has something free - that applies to every age.
Cates react more sensitive as chatter on the crying of the judgers
Biologists studied in Hannover which effect has the call of Cassetbabys on adult animals.
At their surprise, the Miugus also didn't warm the males, but they were always equal to women.
Women's chains can recognize the power speed of Kazenbabys in the middle of the little ones.
They react about 10 percent faster on the way of kicks that appear in great need, like scientists of the animal school and the Medical High School Hannover (MHH).
Cather also reacts on the roads of cooks, but it is always equal.
"Obble are the axistic differences between the mie of less and strongly registered advice for the males or not to mean," said the Biologic Wiebke Connerding of the HH.
She is the first author of the study published in the BMC  Evolutionary Biology in this Friday.
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the long and tonnage height of the coach cryses was distinguished with the thoroughness of their need.
A total of nine adult chambers and eight corners were observed from the maintenance of HIV animals.
You have been played for a call of small ones who were taken for three minutes from the wrive box and were separated from mother and suits.
Otherwise, they were confronted with crystals of stronger retreats that have been added added.
Researchers keep their results, despite the low-scale tests for expensive workers.
"All women, even those who have not yet had their own follow-up, reflected differently on the cry," said Conerding.
They turned fasterly to the laughter when this call was played by the very registered curses.
This capacity may be born or developed with the sex trials.
"It was a surprise that the men reacted over all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on child schools.
Some studies also showed that women female reacted sensitively on colony, even if they were mothers or not, the biologian Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski green with "Gaala" to Supercup
Hakan Slavery is a football lending in Turkey.
In Turkey, one of the other footballstar Hakan Sclaur has been adopted a complaint command.
It is proposed to be a member of a terrorist group.
The first time after the pocket trials in Turkey, a significant football game will be found in Turkey.
Before the dull of the Erzrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul is clearly the official line "Business as usual".
The Government noticed the day of normal hosts when the exemption of the situation after the reverse investigation in July.
But this is not to those who are suspected to listen to the movement of the Predigent Fethullah's goods that are responsible for the trial.
It is also not kept before the football.
On the former Starkicker Hakan Slaghur, the State Office made a complaint.
After this, the middle of the people who live in America will be a member of a terrorist group.
Mr Fethullah, thanks to the applicant of the Prediger Fethullah Vallen, who is responsible for the public investigation by the President of the State Recep Taygun Erdogan.
Since the exemption situation is first applicable for 90 days until October, it has no impact on the lives of most tours but is not a good effect.
The recent "Democracy Watch" on public places throughout the country has declared Erdogan in middle Thursday.
The sport is - like the whole country - paid in addictors and gentlemens.
Specially, the work club's workclub is traditionally not counted to the friends of the President.
But in view of dramatic experiences in the story, the river of military pops is the river of military pops.
There even the fans are one - it doesn't matter whether their heart for Galatasaray or besiktas is struck.
When Pokalsider "Gaala" it will be particularly returned to Lukas Podolski.

In the final game, he obtained the 1:0 segreffer in Fenerbahce.
The "Fanatic" newspaper advised him: "He was the best in the place."
He has completed the saison in an excellent way and his manager guaranteed the pokal.
Thanks “Poldi”, the enthusished season for the Recordmeer, found a ridiculous conclusion.
Following the C.O. in Champions League, the "League" in Europe's League was also early.
It was only six to Rang.
The saison wasn't good.
The pokal was the only opportunity to win something.
"We've done this, and that's the most important," said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas, the year of game was better.
In particular, thanks Mario Gomez, which set the base on the 14th title with 26 saison boards as a Supper-Lig Tower protection.
This is also the reason that the fans continue to return the 31-year-old.
The AC Florence was notified only after the extracted gomes to the AC Florence and noticed to return to the EM vacation for the political situation in the country.
"When Mario wants to come to us, he just must tell it," the Kicker Fachmagazin, Clubchef Fikret Orman.
But it should be ready to verify a third of its estimated annual salary at 7.5 million euros, Orman said: "We can't pay his content with Florence."

Bombenterror in Thailand - Austrian - More All
The Austrian news in Thailand continued to contact the woman, said the speaker of the Foreign Minister, Thomas Schnöll, Friday Morning.
You have disappeared and been treated in the hospital, but it has already been able to leave it again.
Her home trip has planned her for the beginning of September.
Whether the other explosions on the Uruber Island Phuket and the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected Austrian State citizens.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs continues to contact the local authorities in this regard.
During the south of the Bangkok city, Hua Hin Hinh had first explosed on the Thursday town in a quarter of two bombs.
Police was killed and had been killed about 20 people, including Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch countries and three Italians.
On Friday, there were again two springs up, and it was killed by the authorities by another man.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in early.
When the detonation near the bathroom in vacants, Patong was denied after police indications.
In Surat Thani, the southern coast of the country, then explosed another bomb who killed a storm.
The spring is gone by the authorities in a flower beet before the revue of the coast politics to the air.
Finally, the detonation in Phang Nga and along the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the southern east, were still requested several recent detonations.
You're going out of a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, named it.
"The Bombenhavation takes the same manuscript," said the Army General Danai Crit Methavee Friday Brooks before journalists.
"We think it's about a coordinated attack. "
It's too early to exhibit possible motives, but it's likely to handle the acts of muslimian rebells.
The German media also wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical for the bombing of muslimists in the south of the country.
The Thai police explained that the attention was not involved in the Islamistic resistance movement or the international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotages which are limited to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
In addition, the bombs were put by hosts of the ruler military juty.
In the past few days, the authorities would have received secret information on previous requests in the south of the country, but they had not been informed about the exact time and places.
You're still uncertain what groups are going back to the attacks.
The police encourages their officials to strengthen the security around the major government locations, airports, train offices, tourist attractions, restaurants and feedbacks.
In Thailand there are always smaller bombs, but they do not count to tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used over the years of Thailand, King Bumibol Adulyadei.
Following the explosions now, the Austrian External Minister, on its homepage, recommends the instructions of the Thai security authorities, without any consequence.
High security risk (secure level 3) is applicable for the province of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla and Preah Vihear and Surrounding.
Following interactions between security forces and musulmans, the non-necessity of travels in these provinces is not necessary.
Increased security risk (the level of security 2) is applicable for the rest of the country.
The proposals on Thursday and Friday took a few days after an overall referendum on a constitution developed by the Military Youth.
This seems to the great military influence in the coming years.
Junta-Chef and President Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to fix Chaos while the country moves to stability, improved economic and tourism.
The military, who had taken the power after a stage of black unlawful injuries 2014, has been encouraging the Kingdom to return to stability and order.
Nevertheless, the military has not been able to get those in the middle of the South of the country in the grief for many years.
In the conflict, more than 6,500 people have been killed.
A year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok with an attack on a popular Hindu writer - most of them foreign tourists were killed.
It was the most amazing attack of the recent history of the country.
The right "iditarian movement" has been made in the Federal Ambassador for Constitution Protection.
Following several countries, the Constitution Officers also have observed the group.
"We see at the 'Indentarian movement' points for efforts against the freedom of democratic principle," said the Constitutional Chief Hans-Georg Maaching of the German Presse Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants are distributed in extremist manner of islamic faith or from the Middle East.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "iditarian movement" is a group with French roots, which has been also active in Germany since 2012.
She turns on "Multiculti-Wahn," "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "life of its own identity by overflowing."
Traditional designer in nine federal countries - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, low-sheets, Sachsen and Thuringen - watch the "iddentals" already.
Maaje said that his authority had decided closely with the country households.
"Groups like the 'iditary movement' attempt to get their target group where they are," said the Constitutional Privacy Chair.
Generally, extracters try to speak them with a judge language, often with poppiger music.
This islamists are like the right exhibitors.
This is not a special advertisement for the own thing.
The Propaganda should talk to people emotional.
Youth people are particularly attractive.
That's dangerous.
Lastly, there were reports from several federal countries on contacts of the AFD policyrs.
Maassen said he didn't know.
It is possible to contact this kind to be relevant only from a certain point.
It is about whether the Party, in this case, changed by certain persons who are extremely affect their objective and is so extremely extremely.
It is therefore obvious that such persons have influences on the parties.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the clear adoption of legally motivated criminals and attacks on asylum asylumers and refugees, he would not still speak of new rights terrorism.
But in the past years, we found that it can provide legal terrorism structures.
There was the Old School Society group or the Free Task Force.
Other legal terrorism groups or small groups that plan complaints against asylum searchers, refugee homes or attracts from other legally extreme motives.
However, it is not recognizable for Germany or European control of legal terrorism.
The current groups are at the regional level or in social networks.
It was concerned that many circumstances had gone on the account of people who were not prior to the right scene.
That's the career.
Many of the complaints in the attractions of asylum events have not been known before as a criminal, politically motivated criminals or adjudicators of the right scene.
"So many people have started criminals, who had nothing on the hair who might have been politically unnecessed or have chosen, for example, CDU, SPD or links that have then been radiized by legal extremist stimming machines."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte is on the Internethit
The Olympionics or World Records are not always defined in the Olympic games.

However, why are the 24-year-olds participating in the Olympic games?
Ethiopier received a special starting law from the International Swimming Trade.

As the most sporters run in Ethops, you just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Hatte makes it easy for the great rail.
Quick the first nicknames made the road.
Some media called it as "Roble of the Wales".
The English bulletin "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" was pleasing about him.
His time, he killed only a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of free style, did not play a role.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also taken.
At the olympic games of 2000 in Sydney, Eric Moussambani continued to take care of the median attention.
Unfortunately, the attraction of the wedding from Equatorial Guinea was when he had to come in a forehead over 100 meters of free style.
Moussambani was once endorsed in frenetic.

If Donald Trump lost the US Presidency elections in November, it would be relatively important to him: "The last time it will be kicked, or I have a very beautiful, long holiday," said the Republican candidates in a telephone interview with the US tradelors CNBC.
If it is finally unfair for him from reasons of political correction, it is okay, said Trump.
He called the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrates, Hillary Clinton, as a founder of the Islamic State (IS).
Inside its party, the last time, more opposition was formed in the middle of its party.

GfK management depends on the amounts of business
The Consumer Research Company, GfK, made out his head of Matthias Hartmann.
The residues came suddenly - but not very surprised.
The difficult situation of the market research undertaking GfK refused that the steal of the Matsias Hartmann's presence would be more uncertain that the results promised by him remain longer.

Unfalls - Bus wrapped in Krummhörn in Grabs: Eight Last
In an accident of a travel bus with 43 seniors as travelers in Thursday in Krummhörn (LandCreis Aurich) eight people have been dismissed in Thursday.
Two of the insections were seriously violated, the police shared.
The 66-year-old carrier of the bus of a train company from iceanach had to deal with their information on the basis of an agreed laster that was part of the airport.
The bus went right from the street and shot into a grave, as a police speaker of Austria/Wittmund reported.
"Of the situation of the bus, people couldn't leave the bus," she said.
The firewave delivered the insases.
Six rescue cars and an emergency car came to the accident of the country road 2.
The past travelers were returned from a line bus to the Krummhorner city part of Pewsum.
There they should wait for an replacement of the travel company.
The Ombudsmans invited the Laster drivers and the possible witnesses to report to the police.
The costs per kitchen metres are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the removal of Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3,44 instead of until 2,10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3,36 euros (before 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 euros (except 2.18 euros).
In Azendorf, the waste cost will be increased later when appropriate improvements are needed.
Following a overwhelmed qualification, the waste price will be placed at Azendorf at 4,37 euro per kitchen metres.
As the citizen Bernd Stein House (CSU) reported, it was determined in the approval of the budget by the Council of the Kulmbach that it was undercovered for these resorts.
The Kasendorf market is responsible for legal basis to carry out the installations costly.
Since October 1, 2016, the citizens, as well as the Water and Industry operations of Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg are deeply involved in the money sample.
The rate increases between 48 and 67 percent.
As Head of Administration Herbert Schmidt revealed to the Gremium, it was necessary for new calculation of the costs for the removal of the market market.
During October 2016 to September 2020, over-related coverages were also compared from the previous calibration period.
The severe cost increases declined that there was a decrease in all three deficits of relative small institutions with a very lower case of 6800 and 12000 kitchens per year.
Thus, the low-distribution basis on the example of the uses for the necessary repairs of several thousands of euros would be seriously affected.
Furthermore, the resume of water in all three plants will be easily disappeared.
Furthermore, in the recurrent period of qualification, there are no last infringement on the basis of their age of sanitation and repairs in a significant level.
The apartment in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth and Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt said that Azendorf was required to exchange mechanical complaints due to a damage.
In the Pumpwork Womenschenkahl, the old funding plants had to be recovered by about 20 years, and Lopp had to be monitored the operation of the first clothes, which was endorsed by the complaint, and had to be built a further solution in order to maintain the provisions.
Schmidt: "When these extraordinary income have been made, the provisions and maintenance costs have been taken into account in accordance with the new period of qualification."
The same is applicable for the fuel costs which are still clearly under the current level in the previous qualification in 2011/2012.
Row households cleared that, in the low-wass waste case in the three plants, the benefits for the operation and maintenance were "completely proposed".
In the past 20 years, an additional smidt remained by the market of large conversation costs in the removal plants.
The situation of the installations referred to in this area will continue to be precisely extended in view of stone households on the long time, particularly in the area of supplies of the low-border peacekeeping band for these plants, as it is deficienciated.

National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was in July 1% on a monthly basis.
This is the highest value (with June 2012) and the first over zero since October last years, as positive 0.2%.
The average year infringement of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured by CPI -0,8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 %.

Snapchat "Anime" effect critics as Asian carrier
Snapchat says that this filter is inspired Anime, but some observers say it's insensible against races.
With his filter tool it allows Snapchat about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities such a way and that limits to resurrection.
You can turn to an Ananas, a dog or a figur that could be from a Roy lightenstein beaten.
The filters are uncomfortable, properly disastered tools that produce more than 30 million improved Selfies per day.
All injuries have arrived in the public.
Snapchat filters have been in the past critics in which they were accused that the app Blackface would promote or white hair as beautyal.
When there were some users this week, a filter which gave them locks, false deeps and moving furniture, some criticics called a racistic cart of Asians - "greading view".
They asked whether these repeated conflicts showed a greater problem that the company has differentiated.
The news and the accommodation were widely spread in middle, with the reports of The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat, that it would have deactivated the function.
The company made an excuse: the filter was a Homme of Anime Charactere and not thought as a carrier of Asians.
But the outside, who lived the rassism, remembered the filter of harmful climate.
Others decided the anime comparison.
In an e-mail Grace Sparapani, a Corean-American artist student whose second on photos was widely expanded that the filter was "related and pronounced in terms."
She added that " it is difficult to argue with the contradiction of a very opposite Asian carrier and the effects of filtering.
It shows that the filter is not obvious, but that the glass view has been moved into a valuable extract.
Snapchat is not the only company that overcomes these cultural stereries.
The American culture seems to be developed in an endless differentity and integration camp, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all keep in the hand.
And Snapchats' great public of young people - who in matters are different than their older players - could be more than waiting for sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat filters produces an image that for a user is policy, "It's much more difficult that such things remain unmarked as it was before the case," said the 25-year Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu decided to remove her Snapchat account for others to do the same.
In an approximation for media and in a telephone interview, she said that she was thinking that rare countermeasures reflect a lack of diversity in snapchat practices.
Zhu criticised the big white, only male leaders, and sent her appointment with a hashday: #DeleteSnapchat.
“If they have no different representation of people with other hair colors in their power so they can take such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other hair colors working there but are not in positions in which they are sure or certainly feeling to say something."
Others share their views, a complaint which has left the Snapchat mostly responded.
The company does not publish any numbers for the diversity of its own authority and shows on its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snaapchat was engaged to discuss the cultural basis of his employees, but, according to a speaker, the company recently introduced a staff responsible that focused on sub-represented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu said on her side that she would leave her snapchat account and add to "I ask whether they need more users than us to say that it's not okay."
Military management of the ISIS secret service information, sets out the Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed service information to sign a more optimistic image of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and in Syria when it was allowed the actual situation on place, a Congress Committee reported a report on Thursday.
The provisional report, established by a Task Force of the Refugee Members of the Force of the Military Force Commission, the Secret Committee and the Inter-Party Committee, reported of great unfriendly among the Central Command of Secret Services, which reported their estimations to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarter in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asian.
"Provisional information which were typically disappeared by high-ranged Center Commanders, a more positive picture of the American efforts against the terrorism in order to enable the actual situations in place and have been more positive than an analysis of other news Services," presented a newspaper article.
"What happened at Centcom is inaccessible - our soldiers lead if bad analysis of our political leaders are presented," said Ken Calvert, republic member of the representative house.
The leading errors in Centcom are rich to the top of the organization.
The 10-parte report shows detailed challenges in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi war forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government pipes under Obama's instruction to change reports, it shows how the Analysts looked at the pressure of their provisions to draw a more optimistic image of the Islamic State threat, even known as ISIS or ISIL.
"When the first half year 2015, many Central Command Communications, Opinions and Congress were clearly positiver before the Congress than it corresponds to the facts."
For example, a Centcom, a military reservoir of Mosuls could already begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second larger city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of submissions, it is so clear." Mike Pompeo said, republic representative of the Congress of Kansas, in a opinion.
From the middle of 2014 to half of 2015, the springs of the Central Command changed the services reports to play the risks of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicians called the Force in life after playing them that analyzers were concerned about the manager of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge during the reports.
In addition, further reports of the Centcom reports are by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence in Gange.
The Democratic Members of the Notification Committee published their own knowledge on Thursday convened by some of the conclusions of the Republical Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom has created a superstrictly limited process for the establishment of service assessments to ISIL and Iraqn security services," the highest democrat in the Committee, member of the representative of Adam B. ship, in a opinion.
This process, as Mr. ship, "lefted the publication of service reports," the Moral said under Analysts and "Gived a little room for deeper views."
But Mr. ship and the democrates gave no indication to be found on the entry of the white house at the Centcom Analysts concerning a "determined political opinion".
The provisional results of the meetings of the Congress were published on Sunday The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times of Exhibitions reported by the Inspector of Pentagon, who were taken after the complaints of Centcom Analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press speaker of the Pentagon, said that the Ministry of Defence would not comment reports of the Congress while the reports of the Inspector was still in the course.
But he also added that "Experiences sometimes have a comprehensive view on the interpretation of comprehensive data, and that the news and the Ministry of Defence welcomes a conflict debate of these important issues of national defence."
The submissions have reactions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leading in Iraq and Syria (one claim that is made by an increased number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, the complaints of the past year have raised the question, as the President Obama can leave the Central Command for Evaluation of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The critics regarding the secret information on the Islamic State remember suspiciousness of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker presented a letter on how the timely government under George W. Bush faces the recommendations of many Analysts only a small set of appreciation in Iraq and a little time to think about the impacts of the invasion of 2003.
Mr Hooker also played a key role in opposition against the current report on the Islamic State.
Last year, Mr Hooker has noted that Raffiners had no significant impact on the financial position of the terrorism, since these provisoric refrigerations had been taken in operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcoms, a timely commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislation because of its extreme positive assessment of the war situation in a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin went to rest in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen Joseph L. Yourel.
The U.S. win the fourth Match in the Hockey field, a showdown with Britain
One day after she had scattered three tours over a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two tours for the American fieldhockey team of women in a Match on Thursday, that the Americans had triaged with 3-0.
Five tours in two games should actually provide an important performance, but Bam (27) said they couldn't remember what they have ever done.
"I don't know." She said.
I don't listen to people who keep their tours in memory.
However, she knows that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic Weather Championship and are equally in their group with the Brittines on the first place that remains disappeared after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britains and the United States will meet each meeting on Saturday on the last game of the first round.
Both managers have already qualified for the fourthfinal, the game will be decided that the two of their groups of six teams will reach the first and second place.
The first placed will go to the strong high-level countries along the way that takes the other group.
As well as we can get the game on Saturday, the Americans have made a surprise of their success story, four years after they landed at the past of London games on the last 12 places.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey slaughter (and two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player in the United States, the recentest in the history of the Team.
She passed the olympiade in 2008, since she could not qualify herself for the cadeau.
Then the year 2012, where she and her team appeared everything for her and her team.
In the next year, Craig Parnham, an English, trigger of the National Team, began to turn the things to better.
"An cultural change, a mental changing and a physical way," said Bam.
We didn't have the job fees in London, which we have now.
We have been able to cut the ruder completely.
On Thursday, Bam opened the Torreigens in the first half of the game with a back in the middle of the area.
When it was without travel in the Turner, but the team appeared surprisedly and held the status of the game from 1 to the third quarter until Bath took the game into their hands.
She filled a sprint with the flash ball over the left flanke, then went into the middle and shot the ball into the gate to provide the Americans a two-0 drive.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final door in the middle of the last vessels.
The Shutout was the first tourist of the United States tourist, Jackie Briggs, who had to visit every gate in the previous games.
She's got a move.
Like Bath.
"We're in a good position," said Parnham, but how well it's going to depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
In the rage of the Olympian games, the Zen of the Trampolin
Whereever you are, how later it is, there are the Olympic games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steadily and uncertainly, a rare step between competition and strife.
It's like the olympic fackel itself a breathing stage that is sufficient from the arm powder to the turtler to the triat.
You can't enable the televisor to read a newspaper or hear your neighbour in the coffeshop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's still Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who was the first time in the Olympic games and is a female warming with green, could be through these known names who are sent to the first time, built by sponsors and well-being TV warning, if he would be a weak, tourer or even feather.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights at the olympic trampoliturn on gold.
The olympic flame is not equal to any event.
Moreover from the center, partly in the shadow, the sports types that are not generally recognized: air-pistole shooters, trees, bathminton, Taekwondo.
We'll always have the breasts and might be able to dominate for a long time.
But if I have to do different arguments for my own pleasure, then let me give attention to the discreet character of the trampolin.
Although the trampolin has already been an olympic event when it had been in Sydney, it was so gladly recognized that many of the ones I asked didn't know that it was an olympic sport type.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the US Athletes sent to the Wetkampf, it has never gained a medaille in the trampolin and had a athletes that had made it until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians approve to share the prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada this year will defend their gold meal from London.
The trampolin strip has a certain external card, partly because it is more appropriate for the uncovered ear to a clown school than the Olympic games.
In this place, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just a heavy democracy.
It has a humorist potential - the cartony cetters of his skill never want to end up - but also the thanks to the tour and shopping, the two sports artists that are in the essential way.
The word "Trampolin" consists of the Spanish El Trampolin, which means so much as "springbrett".
Turning over on a huge trampoline, nearly 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (thirds, heats and saltos) before them on the feet of the country.
They will be evaluated according to the official Olympia program after execution, hardness speed and "Flug time".
Athletes of 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will be attracted in Rio.
The most common olympic vector is out.
Mededields must go further to gold, faster, upstair and over, sometimes to the target, sometimes and sometimes back, top and down to the game place.
They do not only the objective or the exit line, but also the transmission of the television also is another housing goal: the world or the olympia record.
The targeted struggle is noble, wonderful, even fantastic - and it's enough to push a survey to dreams.
But it's also what I myself recommend in view of these games as something of encouraging.
The trampolin offers a Atempause.
The vector of the trampolinspringer is upper.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she goes, seems to be hard like a astronaut, goes up, then to down, then we're molling again.
There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but while the delivery there is no hectical attack on the goal, no wood in the television, only the dream, elegant uprising of time and weakness.
It's how the competition can only be in the Olympic games.
The qualifications and ends of the women will be held on Friday afternoon, at the streaming of about 13.00 East Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00 p.m.
NBC is exhibited as part of a afternoonblock on two days from 14.00.
In the olympia manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one who is likely to be overviewed in general tumult.
If the conscious increase can be reached only by the fear and the objectivization of male athletes - how the men's tourists are about the The Wall Street Journal shortly - then Mr Dooley is waiting for his ringing to the air, new flags.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, a member of the United States
Violence-active Protesters in Ethiopia
Demonstrators who call for political changes in Ethiopia have been strongly opposed by the government.
The Witnesses say that thirty protestants were killed during the congress with the police in shoes.
Are the Ethiopia to break up?
In the last ten years, there was one of the most strongest African countries, a solid partner of the West, with a fast growing economy.
But in the past months, the country was protected against the government and the country was continually disappeared in more areas.
Last week, thousands of people moved on the streets and needed fundamental political changes.
The response of the Government was unfortunate by human rights organizations.
The Witnesses showed that policemen were shot and killed at thirty unwashed demonists.
In the course of videos of the protesters that are likely from the last or beginning of this year, show how secure people killed young people with rocks, while they were encouraged to make a stand against a wall.
The Chief of the United Nations Authority for Human Rights now requires an immediate investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together, and to the future it will be even more difficult", said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of African Horn of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most popular African country and its stability of the West.
American military and secret services are working closely with the Ethiopiers to fight terrorism over the region outside, especially in Somalia. Only few countries in Africa, if most of all, receive so many western assistance.
The Ethiopia economy has extended considerable time.
His infrastructure has been drastically improved - there is a new pending tour in the Adis Abeba capital.
The streets are usually quiet, secure and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was all other than a form of democracy - human rights organizations have continued pressure by the Government - the opposition in the country was limited, and disidents have been effectively harmed.
Many were sent to the Exil or prison, killed or thrown into the towns of the wilderness.
But this could change.
"When you're angry, and these no other options do not have to protest it," said Seyoum Teshome, a decent in Central Hiops.
The whole youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from the ground use until the warrant attack in relation to the power of the regimental coalition.
After a widely critic election last year, the government parties and their members received the last seat of the opposition and are now 100 percent of the Parliament.
At the same time, the crossings increased by the border in Eritrea; a fight for this sweet, contrary line requested hundreds of life in June.
Analytics fear that Separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Bord or the National Liberation of the Ogad, who have been more or less damaged in the past years, could protect tours and re-arrhoes.
Several factors explain why feelings of defence now explode in years before the surface.
The first seems to be harmful: Smartphones.
For the first years, many Ethiopiers were able to communicate with social media, as the lower smartphones were always more frequently and improved the Internet services.
Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular cases, especially in protesters, many people can still communicate about Internet proxies, which hide where they stop.
Several young Ethiopias indicated that they were gathered to protesters.
The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and the EN, the two greatest Ethiods in Ethiopia.
The orromoses and the enemies are not natural enemies.
Since Eonians prospered the Ethiopians who come from Ethopians over the major Christian greenlands in politics and economics while they emitted the oromos, many muscles and live in Flachland areas.
But it's just changed.
"We are about to coordinate under a shooter," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protesters found in the areas of the Asian and Oromos.
Many the Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which are about 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and policy.
The third reason for the unlawful is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebellenist leader, was until his death at a not public disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia Prime Minister.
He was seen as a tactical genial, a man who could think about ecks.
Analysts say that he was particularly obliged to fulfil the early signs of unfriendly and to use special advocates to edit hurts and to do them inevitably.
"The current regime does not fail on this basic fashion," said Mr Abdi, a conflictanalytic.
The Ethiopia new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Declarations, has been selected from relatively sensitive reasons to accept the position of Mr Meles.
Otherwise, Mr Meles, who came out of the north side of Tigray, has come to Hailemariam from the south.
Analytics say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more damage.
The last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an injury in 2005, after thousands of protested against elections, which appeared to be paid by the government and then stolen.
During the following razzis, many protestants were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and that time of injuries had been relatively fast over.
Developing experts encouraged Ethiopia leaders for their visional infrastructure planning, such as the new penalty, and for their messable progress in poverty fighting.
But obviously, this does not prevent the intensification of the internal misfortunect of the Ethiopia Government.
And she takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month Protestants in Gondar, a Ammonian city, a business conducted by Tigray and hate is always more usual in social media.
Analytics say that the Protects bring the United States and other Western participations to their own position.
The American Government used Ethiopia as a base for drug flights on the nearby Somalia, even though she had recently shared that she had closed this basis.
During the Western, he clearly wants the democracy to support, he doesn't want his participant to join in an already full area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "It's a very dark growing."
Donald Trump explains that Obama has founded ISIS was "Sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried to disperse the last controversies that he had destroyed his campaign by showing that his more frequently republication, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not have been the "Grender" of the Islamic State.
This clarification made new questions concerning the competitiveness of the Presidency scenario of the Republics to communicate with the American public.
It also brings his fellow workers to take him in protection during a achieved phase, to explain the own position of views that he couldn't have agreed.
After he had made the meeting at an electional event at the middle of the meeting, he called Mr Trump on the signing on Thursday and was found in Interviews that he was really not intended to say, the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in a morningday, Mr. Trump said he's just sarcastic.
The second was the opposite to the previous day, in which Mr Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accused is completely serious.
When the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr Trump to disappear the statement by recalling him that Obama ISIS wants to destroy, the republic Presidencyskandid was nothing to know about it.
The last stage of the critics went down to Mr. Trump, while he tried to focus his campaign because of deep survey values to the economic situation.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.
He warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and he found their words long.
Mr. Trump has already submitted Sarkasmus to his defence.
At the end of July, he made strong criticism, when he said that the Russians should put up Mrs. Clinton's Emails, but he later explained "naturally I mean the sarcastic."
This method allows Mr Trump to move the speaking borders into the policy and then back to need.
"I think it's one of his methods of testing how some news are taken from his branch, as they arrived, and then "while" according to the reaction, "he said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert that observes the language of both candidates.
I also believe that it is clear enough to keep his comments enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of enforcement of the tone for the presidency elections, Mr Trump adopted a more recent tone, since its survey values have continued.
A new survey of NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leadership with a great prejudice in the Federal States of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-and-capf series in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries to not be defended for his provocative exceptions, he often accuses his criticians to disappear his expertise or to understand his humor wrong.
But while he increased the focus of the attention in the last months of his presidency campaign, Mr Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal fellows to the incompatible situation to stand on him, depending on how proof it might also be his explanation.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former citizen minister of New York and one of Trumps, has a great effort to defend candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I think what he says is legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked for the truth of Mr Trumps Exaction whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
In this sense it is true that before Obama ISIS was a almost unknown, small organization, he called her barriers, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he was off the troops from Iraq.
Most of the Mainstream Republics try to argue that the Government under Obama, in Mrs. Clinton, served the Foreign Minister, it allowed ISIS to spread by enlarge the situation in the Middle East.
Before the electoral events in Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and commanded them to refer every word to him.
He admired the "arms, daily" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the democrates have been excused by Mr Trumps as a further evidence that he was unfair for the President.
Once the price is disappeared from the market, Café returns to Greenpoint
By Café was a fine coffee in Williamsburg where you could only pay bar that had no Wi-Fi, but that's why he served a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were disappeared from his Bedford Avenue loadfront.
The Soap Cherie Business, which was replaced in the summer 2014, sold Sefes in form of Cupcakes.
The homes have been afflicted as a last loss in a gentified city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know that New York is changed, but I can't still believe that CBGB is dead and the Chelsea hotel is now an affair."
But if New York's change, it's also new-fiction.
A Remote Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a half north of his original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same workers and a similar slight atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-year worker of the old coffee, the owner and manager of the new coffee.
He began to work at Beb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When he offered a customer to prepare money for a new outside, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, helps many.
Verb used the same distributor for the baths bought the same Espresso machine model.
It's even using the same lamps from the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.
He brought new additives.
On the food card, Sandwiches are with specifics and kitchen and there are garnages like capers and saddled kibels.
There are natural rivers.
The coffee does not serve any bier, so there's fresh seats.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noted a road flower of old stammels.
"So many old customers were also disappeared by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
On Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived early in Williamsburg and visited regularly.
Even after she was moved to Greenpoint, she would take the way on herself.
After the lock, she opened the coffee drink, she said.
"Mir was obvious that it was on the coffee and the culture in the bottle that pleased me," she said.
Now she drunks coffee again, even if she was presenting her usual Iced coffees a Blended Chai Tea, which is another new addment.
Tom Rosenthal has been a further long-year- and faithful client since the end of the Verb in 2003.
He went there before the work and was unresolvedly always the same.
"I came four after seven, every day, like a Swiss powder and they prepared my everything bottle with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and take new adds into the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still receives his usual order, but sometimes he changes its everything beach with specific, ei and kitchen.
Rodriguez said he didn't hurt a lot about that the duty took the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie were shipping to create a special weight for Blee with the coffee coffee of the coffee as an additive.
"I think we'll still go to her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional, political and political residents Greenpoints also accepted the Café.
A new customer has translated the food card to the Poland and said Rodriguez that he would like to get them quickly, so his new neighbors welcome.
The location also has further actions.
A local Saftlocal wants to fill and sell the coffee coffee in flats.
There is a chance that the coffee has expanded a nearby building.
For many customers it's enough for a new connection to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a stammel and said he was destroyed on the ground when the coffee was closed.
When the new Café opened, whitt said that the attraction of the local and the design was a new café as a home return.
"I had to cry," he said.
The deprimative food of the economic crisis in "reaching season"
In March 1933, shortly after his upcoming to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his summer at the Oval Office.
As a Feinschmecker, the President Roosevelt had a fabel for raffined delikates of the Fifth Avenue like Paste the grass and Maryland waterschildkroten suppe.
His menu at this day was something more distinguished: filled eggs in Tomatensauce, cartofflephore and as desert a flaming pump.
"It was an act of kilinary solidarity with leading people," said Jane Zegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added," it was also a message to the Americans as they should eat."
The husband lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both foodhistorics.
Coes last book "Chop Suey" acted from the Chinese kitchen in the United States, while Ziegelman tells her "97 Orchard" about life in a living house in the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Its recent cooperation, "Every Feed Time," appearing on Sunday in the Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of the American kitchen during the Great Depression.
They showed kulinarian solidarity when they met a reporter in the Iisenberg's Sandwich shop at the dinner, a small, black imbiss in the Flatiron district, which has already been in the business since the Börsencrash 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, was prepared a frish and wake with oil vessels, while coe, 57, Truthahn with cartophel peppers and meats.
When the reporter was designed by the Hackbrates, this found the couple for a debate on the food in the sane of the Great Depression.
"Retail foods were very loved," said Segelman.
There were Erdnus brots, Leberks and Bodenbrots.
They were prepared out of an additive and some picture that strives the accommodation.
Be careful to eat so many earthquakes that they serve them as dinner.
Green cooking.
"It must have been put in the moon like Blei," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in a American budget, especially in rural areas, a All-You-Can-Eat-Buffet.
Women's manage was bought for male field workers and it was fresh back feasts for dinner, dinners and dinners served.
They were Americans who sent food for hunger Europeans during the first World War. "A Square Meal" means the ways that the country moved to be no longer the country.
"It was a time in the food for the Americans, a centrally relaxed topic," said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Genuso was the new budget: secret foods such as bread and coons were made on basic foods that were recognized as "wonder kind of food," she noted, since the cups of non-opathetic ingredients could hide under a creative sauce.
Frisches object was replaced by the payment of the trocken object.
The meat, which was for the years of the middle of the American cuisine, was a rarely served luxury.
Personal miscarriages were tried because a harmful and nice warming priority had been made in the case or even healthy kitchen understanding.
During their search for the book, which also includes receptes, a trial prepared a court of this epoche, backened kibels with a landscape.
"It wasn't a favorite addition on the middleman," said Coe.
"It was surreal."
Earth bottles and back bottles do not match each other.
It was typically for many of the households.
As never before or ever, three budgetary economics - including Louise Stanley, Leader of the Federal Office of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the habits of the country are thirty.
When they were published receptores and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to be "inside the maintenance policy" and the challenge of transforming pamps like creamed Spaghetti with Karotts in the coastal season.
A Square Meal is a festival of historical leckerbiss.
In particular, the reports of the Government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Cook-Ethe-Agency.
While he opened the simple Yowa farmer coke of his kitchen, he spent as the millions of the world's men to whom he became.
"He loved continental kitchen like fish with gurkensauce," said Coe.
He ate in a almost loose food room and took a smoking.
He was a great reality gentleman.
The President Roosevelt might have started the same error if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to put it in a form of compliance with his master.
As described in the book, the hosts of a household with no interest in the disagreement offices by Mrs Roosevelt produced the most longest food in Washington, but also one of the most unfortunately prepared."
Many of the species of medicines of the Great Depression to get out of food, was rejected as soon as the country came back to the feet.
The memory is on our continuing focus on Kalories and Foods, she said Zegelman, as well as on how science was used on food.
The couple in writing to the book had better understood the customs of woodman's mutters - for example, how she couldn't throw food.
"They had a real fear of the disappearance of food," said Coe.
Zegelman remembered, "She did people really sick."
There was the wind-shirt case.
After the Tellers were disappeared at Eisenberg's house, they went and Coe made a desert that they had prepared at home: the plantist of the President Roosevelt was eating on midday.
"It will be called Prune Whip," she said, "and added that it was a usual trick to deal with the receipts a sending name.
There were no struck shoes, only plants, something meal, sugar, water and weight.
Everyone bought something contrary to a liver in the sweet, brauning lebbers.
Surely, it wasn't bad.
Coe took a trip.
As a Can-Do Budgetier, he said to his wife, "A few hungry Walns would help."
At the Bomben attack, he was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life on the game to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the heroin of Aleppo: Khaled Omar teared his life to the people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others.
Now the 30-year-old has died at a fasbombben attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civilian protection group, which had been saved by about 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers put their own life on the game to leave people from dispersed houses and to provide the first help in the war area.
You're the army of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civil shelter that showed him at a 11-year-old rescue of a dream from the dreams of a house, 2014 went around the world.
It made the Syrians to light the symbol in the green of the war.
But when he had never seen himself, he said, 'For me, this is the real Jihad.'
"If I die to save life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Soon before Omar himself fell on the victim, he spoke in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria.
The Helikopers have thrown four fasbombs over the Alzadia-Bezirk, one was filled with Chlorgas.
A woman and two children died, seven people lead to Atemnot.
"We now eliminate the gifts of the bomb so that you don't play children," the image of his last words before he died.
The death bomb of the Asad regime had to meet terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest wirbelier is almost 400 years old
Look at you.
Greenland will only be in the winter to the surface.
This has continued after an investigation on the board of the research ship Sanna to the sea.
He was born 1624 and weighed with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to today.
Greenland gets 150 years afterwuchs.
The Greenlandhai is along the north Atlantic basis, in a hour he reached a average of 1,220 meters.
Only if it comes on, the five meters long animal will accelerate satiate 2.6 km/h and is so fast as a robbe.
This lifestyle offered by longness, but it seems to be a patent caption for a high age.
Julius Nielsen by the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the Science magazine of a Greenlandhai who could be 392 years old.
"Wahnsinn", commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, these life margins, which means a world record for the currents.
Although the evolution biologue has been changed for a long time that Greenland has been stoned.
Only they missed the evidence.
Greenland is difficult to observe, and finally, they live in the islander before the thirst coasts of Canada, Greece, Norway and Spitzbergs.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees of Celsius, they're on the surface mostly opening only in the winter.
The Greenland Haii knows little about the lifestyle of the researchers.
Their time of lights were made when they had equipped six animals with a sender before splitzbergs.
These hairs do yet: researchers found the surroundingest of a robe, one other had spent the kifer knees of a young icebber.
They may be sleeping animals or paintings on the basis of the eismant and seeking cadder that drag out of higher water storys.
July Nielsen and his colleagues have now studied 28 Greenland Hai who had fishers from 2010 to 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen as a participation from the team of the North Atlantic Atlantics.
The smallest ha was 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters.
To produce the age of the animals, they analyzed with the coal-14 meteode the linsencers of the hae.
This center of the eye is already originated before the birth of the hairs that contained proteins will not later be renewed.
The two smallest hairs had a lot of carbon-14 in the lion corner.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when larger numbers of these radioactive coal substances in the atmosphere were injured.
In the length of 220 centimeters, third-party animals include a low overseas of coal substance-14 from nuclear weapons in 2012, so its 50th birthday should be produced.
All the larger Greenland hai in their licensers were normal coal 14 females, which rises by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the coal 14 center for a 493 centimeter long Greenlandhai was a age of 335 years, while the rekord-hai was 502 centimeters even 392 years old.
This Greenlandhai-weapon until then they followed, when they were more than four meters, it was known.
Now the researchers were able to order a age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters has probably been determined to the sex trip and his age was 156 years old, Greeceland Hai is clearly to increase at least one half a century.
This should also be the current World Record.
This is not a case of such methusiasm, especially in their waters.
The present recorder, a 211-year-old Greenlandwal, in which a 120-year-old Harpunenspitze was taken before Alaska.
The low temperatures often also takes the organism of the living animals on sparflows.
So they're moving later - and elderly slower.
In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also particularly large.
For the volume grows much faster than his surface, through which the animal warms.
The loss of warming of a gramm mouse is therefore much greater than at a gram Elefant.
Another benefit: you have less enemies.
"A smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on the most likely possible to have many seeds."
A very large animal should have to invest its resources more in a long life.
Foundation in Double Package
With the topics around the Bauen, the municipal Council has focused hardly at the recent meeting.
It was easily easy to make the report of the citizen Robert Putz that “the marketing of the recently exposed habitats can start.”
Following the foundation, parking and conclusion issues and the applications could be made on measurement, the sale of the basic areas in the habitation areas "Straßlway" and "Schönau-West" (Brich Binderstraße - Educed Section 1) is nothing more on the way.
The Communities Council is convinced that the buildings in the rurally imposed and peacefully living in the beauty of young families and sore seniors are similarly.
As it said, Budget can immediately be informed in the Council's House, the Council will be consulted at its September meeting.
In order to also be requested for the admission of further farms related to the creation of jobs, the Communities Council decided to re-change the plan of ground use created first in the spring of this year.
Thus, in the area of time, the green area already extended by two parcial directions in the State Street 2112.
Frankfurt benefited by Brexit
The city on Main then has the best opportunity for employment and firms from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It's very likely that Frankfurt benefits most of the Brexit Votum," says Michael Veltländer, the manager of the competence area's financial markets and the real estate markets of the IW.
Following the Brexit Record, it is uncertain whether money homes may be able to operate further from London from financial businesses throughout the EU.
For the EU's so-called passport, they have the authorisation in Britain.
It's just using large US banks.
More banks have already announced to delay jobs.
The "Frankfurt Main Finance" associated with 10000 new jobs on Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW, speaking of the European Central Bank (ECB), is responsible for the monetary policy and overseeing of the largest eurozone banks, and other important authorities such as the European EIOPA insurance Surveillance and the ESRB risk Council.
In Paris, the organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its main session, but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The neighborhood of the notice bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision", says the Professional IW.
However, Luxembourg has hidden a large fund sector, but it is worse than Dublin in the infrastructure.
Frankfurt is very easier to reach the great airport.
Further points the city with easily available water accommodation.
"In Paris, it is not so easy to find free high quality offices", says Viutl countries.
In addition, the mixes for first classized watermmobilities are approximately 50 percent of more than the main.
Furthermore, Frankfurt offers higher life quality than competition through good medical and infrastructure and less criminality.
In a ranking of the company management Mercer, the city has risen to seven places, Luxembourg on place 19, Dublin at 33 and Paris at 37th place.
Although life quality is a question of the preferences: "For its already strong position as a financial position for the European market, Frankfurt could take further banks and investors," IW follows.
However, although the Brexit-Votus is the most important financial centre in Europe, my economic researchers will remain.
For this reason, the forces are also speaking: In London, the numbers of the country bank Helaba end of 2015 were about 144000 people in the bank market, in Frankfurt were 62,500.
Gilead retains the right costs from the Hepatitis C Patent Street with Merck
A US Officer decided that Gilead Sciences Inc approximation to the recovery of the legal costs you have taken from the Hepatite C right Street with the Pharma company Merck & Co Inc.

During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find on the country selection list of the hotel.
However, the country was not listed between countries that could be called directly from the hotel.
How is it in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, possible that Israel was eliminiated and removed?
He wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Compactsi Bristol offers a possibility of selecting Israel about a own call Center.
After a searching declaration, the director turned to the hotel reseption.
The answer he received there, "whocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel officer said that the measure was a "perspective decision of the manager of the complasski hotels".

The Israeli messenger in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called it a "grown shame", reports the South Deighty Journal.
We were disappeared from this event.
It's really very terrified.
The fact that this has been made in Germany exactly in this hotel chain is even a greater damage.
This does not require any declaration.
We hoped the hotel 'the right conclusions' said the officer.
The case of the case, a very great resonance on the internet, in which people called the whole scanal.
Some signed the Festivalski hotel that it would be the pleasant requests of the Arab guests.

During the hot days, the group was endorsed in the deep sea in Maul sources, which had come to sprongs, dances and planets.
Kulinaric children and Beters were used to prepare their body speeds with themselves, such as the saffy springs, the Seebrous, Isleshauser Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tubinger Bolognese.
In Workshops, beautiful shots of pearls and stones were created or produced from wood a Roman mule game.
Further height points of the free time were the case in a nearest tea, the evening on the fire and the final "Baunt evening".
On the day of the home trip, the sun and the children and youth returned satisfactory home.
Haagloch: Pilgers to the lack of mercy
The ministers of the season care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way of a fourthday pilgrim migration of multilingling to Freeburg.
Commonly, four steps were deployed.
In order to overcome the time to the next Romwall trip of all ministry for two years, he decided to prepare and implement a multidisciplinary pilgrim migration.
Various flood objectives were tried and finally decided to the Bishofsstadt of Freiburg, where in this year a special pilger’s holy year of mercy had been ordered to open the barrier at the Freeburger Münster.
16 Minis from prayer sources, Gruol, hair loch and sanctuary came on the way.
On the evening before, the pillar of Storost sent the pillar out in a small feast in St. Anna, blessed the pilger crowd and divided the pilger segment.
From Horb, by train to the starting point Villingen, where a Münster of Our Love woman was, and so the pilger road was reached from the munster.
The individual daytimes were overwhelmed by a short impulsion with various prayers, ladys and Scriptures.
But also under the way, the mins of field crystals, caps or churches were always raced to sing together a song of their own pilger loeding.
For overseeings, each of the local park homes were available.
At the past goals, Alexandera Burkhardt and Heidi Faller were kept for a huge and strong dinner and breakfast.
It went on the second day about Furtdays to goodsbach.
At the end of the day, the Etappes went to St. Peter, which was the most stretching way, but at the beginning, at about 500 meters of skills had to be removed and then returned.
The lower reward was finally a common singing on the bathroom.
After the morning in the fourth Pilgrim Day, St. Peter’s imposing Closter Church went to the clash apps to Freiburg.
It seems to be easily easy and happy that the ministry took place on the afternoon day at the Freeburger Münster and overthrowed the lacks of mercy.
With a small impuls, God was thanked here.
The ministry of cooperator Markus Obert in the garden was welcomed at the Pilger target at the Pilger.
After God’s service, the pilgrims were able to visit the Sakrists and the high-altare.
The next day was still time for the Breisgaumeter pool.
After middleday, he went back to Horb.
Finally, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were imposed.
Schotte Callum Skiner runs home when Brite Gold for Radsport
Shottland's Callum Skiner store store last night in the male team print in Rio Velodrom to rest, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old of Glasgow took the anker role that his landsman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself in himself. The young man made the sweet stomach when he moved to home to find a victory of the favorite New Zealand.
England suggested a shocking victory four years ago, while Today took the fifth of six Olympiagoldmedalens.
They reiterated the trick after they took in March at the railways in London, although Hoys' return was only a separate sixth place.
The problem between Peking and London was the replacement of the carrier Jamie Staff.
They did this at time as a Hind.
Hoy's tranquility created a lie that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man where they stayed when they saw the potential in the shadow that had now disappeared.
Indeed, Kenny - who had four years ago scattered with Hoy - and scene set a Olympia record, but in the standard mountains the new countries in the first round.
And the British trio win the dull with gold.
After his rock, Kenny took the team back and skined it.
A strategy change made a large part of the transformation, when the hinds went into a higher gap to enhance him and allow Kenny and especially the scene to keep the time.
Hoy looked out of his position as BBC experts and fell down Skinner, Kenny and Hinde, when they drew on the podest.
The 23-year-old scene from Glasgow said, "It's a massive comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and to make me a name.
We've built an olympia record in the end and the world managers have seen.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph, Kennys and Hoys added Hindes that after a weak start he fell on the train.
He returned this statement later and there was no invoice of England's Rivalen.
There was no such problem at such a surprised success this time.
Hind said, "It feels like all the GB Flagges on the tribe like London."
We've come together in the last three months as a team.
We came out at so many world titles so bad that it was incredible to gain again at the olympiade.
This is an event, a gold meal for the nation that has been won seven of 10 titles in Peking as well as in London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months that we have been looking for successful five days in the Velodrom.
With the form Kennys it is in the area of the possibility that he repeated Hoys victory of three olympic gold medles in a competition.
This would be for Kenny - the exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on 23 March (a apparent date for the British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - an exhibition of six gold meal and a silver meal.
That's the same of Hoy.
Kenny takes part in the printing sprint, which is starting today and going over three days.
The 28-year-old of Bolton said, "I just enjoy this for the moment."
The team experience is always the best.
You can win it with his colleagues.
It feels like one thing to win alone.
He said, "If he wins other two gold meals, he should be killed to the river."
It was the only medal lawyer of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clacy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were qualified with the fastest performance in four kilometers.
They came in 3:51.942 to the goal.
The World Record winning in London 2012 was at 3:51.659.
The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the Weather Review, where Wiggin will stand on the focus.
He had acted with complaints before qualification when he called to functionaries to measure his body size.
In the relevant law, which is continued and ended in the morning, awarded Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavi in World Record in 4:13.260.
The GB team leaves on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympian games and bring a crash to Medaillen.
Following a real extraordinary presentation of absolute Dominnz in Peking and London, the expectations for Rio were encountered.
The Drama played in the background, so the return of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April in the middle of sexism and mobbing preventions and the rest of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks soon as the current legend GB's call, which has reached its height at the perfect moment.
The future of the shipment of Portland on the basis of the resumption of the Energy Agreement
The future of the aluminium cells of Portland in Victoria - as well as of the hundred jobs of workers - is on the game, since the supplier has announced the energy delivery contract and in order to uphold all the delivery contracts, as shared by the delivery energy company.
This step followed the decision of the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year to grant no additional subsidies to the operation of the attachment.
A subvention established for 20 years is issued in November.
Before 2000's jobs in the installation of Alcoa in Portland are on the game.
Not less than 2000 jobs - directors and indirects - could be dangerous at a closement.
Furthermore, it could happen to the effects because the wheel grain consumes approximately 10 percent of the whole stromer production of Victorias.
2014, Alcoa concluded the point Henry Schmelzerie, which led to close the English power tool last year.
Alcoa in Portland lost money and risks closure.
This step follows the recent speculations in respect of the future of the installation, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last, on the basis of the fuel price for the installation.
AGL, which provides the large aluminium mixture with his Loy Yang A powerwerk in Latrobe Valley, shared that three other owners would announce their contracts.
The installation is available in most of the possession of a Joint Venture of Alcoa and Alumina, which keeps the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marbuni Corps smaller.
"AGL provides that the installation in Portland will continue to operate, which means another physical demand for the flower by the shelter," the company shared.
AGL continued to demonstrate that the contracts referred to as "security laws" should have entered into force since November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month declaration period so they will end 2017.
"AGL therefore indicates that the agreements will be contributed to the income year 17," said the Strom leader.
All potential impacts on AGL's income from GJ 18 are currently limited by the perspectives of the powerful deadline markets for large trade prices.
AGL reported that it has already been described in its annual decrease of $187 million in "Attention of a preaching" in $ 187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to describe the contracts to the "capacity of Alcoas... to operate the furniture or to ensure the fuel supply to the cell" does not affect.
The United States Sub-Commission said that it was 2010 a 20-year-old contract with Loy Yang which would have entered into force by November this year, even if there was still a declaration of the fact why it was backed from the Treaty.
Analytics warn the bad economic circumstances of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland sleeve in Victoria and the Tomago building near Newcastle.
Concerning the comments of the analysis beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both plants were disappeared from the market, it would mean a significant reduction of the demand on the [Strom market].
And for us, as a stromer producer, it wouldn't be good," he said.
More than a cardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the week of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Clans crisis is on the cover of the dedicated September of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the Markenbotschafter of Estee Lauder, and traveled to the Fashion Weeks in Miland, Paris and New York, announced the news on its instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room of full people I love brought me the view of this cover to wine," wrote Kendall.
The enthusiasm of the Covers followed a stranger (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians?), scripted reality-Video, which shows the whole cardashian-Jenner family (excluding the problems of Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most loved showbiz objects and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forget the Cover of her sister and that with a classic behaviour: they have all planned a supervisory party.
This makes the clinical behaviour near every birthday episode (Seacrest gave the order, "You thought we had forgotten?"," with the honor of a sign of a tiny knife on an sending place at 8:00 a.m.), but Kris had to allow her other girls to participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September of Vogue, a new medicine of the Kardashians has started securely.
Kendalls, great sister Kim, could have killed what is going on the Vogue Cover (these and her husband Canye West were to see it in April 2014), but the Cover of the publication of the magazine is a liga for himself.
The September expenditure for Vogue is the most saled expenditure of the year.
With a range like a image band as a modern period, the outputs include a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista was from the 832 pages of the forest 615 pages Werbung).
The deterioration of his Coverstar is so valuable that in the last two years the journal's images have still been in the form of the official note.
Women who were already on the cover included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In the past few years, there were clearly more "Beremtheaters, models" as "modells that are beasts" on the cover.
Oscar Pricepartin and Dior-Markenbotschafter Jennifer Lawrence were on the cover 2013, after year after Lady Gaga was honored.
But even at the low opportunity that Ms. Jenner, which is described by the magazine as the "Durchbrochmodel" of her generation, falls under the previous category, is in a good society.
These festivals are not faced with famous people or reality Stars or youths today who know how to look at a good Snapchat Video (such as if all of them is to Jenner).
They are really talented women that describe themselves in the conversation sector.
Beyonce, appearing on the last cup, had published Lemonade one of the most successful years of her carrier.
Of course, Jenners does not like any success.
With her reality TV story, Jenners had always been a position in the modern world.
In June the other Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid cried her "the mixture of the moment."
These feelings rise again when the message with the Jenners appeared on the oak Cover.
But it seems to pass on the mismut on the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the caver's expenses of the Vogue.
She is a supermode in the most real sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacob's.
She makes a publication for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
You and all their sisters sell pictures of yourself on their respective Paywall apps.
She sold from her made pictures from Cindy Crawford's daughter to the LOVE magazine.
And in their free time it is to see her in reality TV. It's probably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
Show community rights centers annually 160,000 people
More than 160,000 of the country's support needs will be rejected annually by the community law centres, while the industry has been enclosed on the impact of further Mediterranean reductions on already overlayed transactions.
In Queensland, there are already three of five people - most of older persons, immigrants, employees, victims of violence and those who have no resources for unfair dislocations and similar -- when their requests are requested for free legal and legal assistance.
The legal services of the community, which have already been overtime charged, are prepared for further shortcomings.
Since June the next year, the legal centres are intended to lose further 30 percent of their federal resources.
The Director of the Common Rights Centres of Queesland James Farrell said that the last upcoming of the National Agreement of Common Rights had shown that thousands of people are rejected every year.
Farrell said that the situation without a decrease of the Federal Government’s decision would only be worse.
"The Queens country community law centres are chronicly underfined, which means that thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected," he said.
People who leave forced relations, people with unvisable and disappointed crimes, families who go through divisions, workers who have unfairly solved -- all these people have problems of legal kind and this exhibition show that they can not receive the help they need.
From June 2017, the Federal Government will cut the funds of about 30 percent, which means that thousands of people who need to be dismissed from Queensland will be able to agree with their legal problems without any assistance.
We call for the General Container and Federal Justice Minister, and Senators of Queensland George Brandis, to resolve directly these medium accelerations, so people can get the help they need to get in legal problems.
Last year, the country Government satisfyed its allocation to the national average resources.
It is now time to see the needs of communities and their customers and that the Government of Palaszcsuk invests in this important work.
Donald Trump selection campaign applauded after employer's well-being weapon
New York: Donald Trumps campaign has been appealed because of an unactivity, after she was shared that her campaign leader for North Carolina in February has assigned a gun on a worker while they were in February in a Jeep.
The case is described in an appeal which was introduced by Vincent Bordini in the middle of the country guide by Charlotte, a former software programer for campaigns in this Federal State.
Bordini had been waiting for months that the matter would be regulated within before he realized that "not happening."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "Good a pistole, put his right scener on the scene, and recorded the course in Vincent's Knischehle," gave Bordini in his complaint.
After he had evaluated the local and regional campaign campaign, Bordini found that at least four other people had already done the same experience with Philip, he was in the appeal.
"Backs must not be dismissed to hurt," said Bordini.
The complaint is only two days after the republic presidency skidded, when he said that the "Scod Amendment Humans" should take measures if his rivalin Hillary Clinton should be chosen and judges.
Trump's campaign cleared that the media would have escaped his words from the context and that he wouldn't be pushed to violence.
Bordinis complainant requires a disaster of the campaign for the violation of the careful commitment and Philip because of the abuse of body and remaining self-related damage.
Trumps Press speaker Hope Hicks was not to reach a opinion.
Try Philip to contact the slaughters likewise.
WCCB, a local newsman in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is not a longer employer of the campaign.
At calls at its advice, Innovative Consulting Services were not reacted.
The Republical Presidencyskandidat Donald Trump has taken a controverse campaign.
The procedure lays down Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Request for country warnings: lose SPD and CDU
The elections in the Federal States of Micklenburg Forums (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) include significant losses for government parties SPD and CDU.
This provides representative surveys of the INSA opinion research Institute for the "image" chart (First Day).
While red black government coalition could continue to rule in the north, it is impossible after the survey values in Berlin.
In both federal countries, SPD would be the most strongest party and would have a good opportunity to continue the government heads.
In Mecklenburg Warmers, SPD was 35.6 percent to 24 percent ago.
The parties shall therefore define the survey only before the CDU that could return to 23 percent.
The third place is interference between the left and the afD.
The left will be 19 percent (for example, 18.4 percent), which AfD would be represented by 19 percent first in the countryday.
The green remains even though easier losses with 6 percent (fore 8,7 percent) again to the Summer Land Day.
NPD and FDP would not be represented at the countryday with 3 percent.
At the Berlin Deputy House election, the SPD is only 23 percent of the survey (Whl 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU has reached only 18 percent to 23.4 percent.
It is still behind the green (2011: 17.6 percent), but the left with 15 percent (fore 11.7 percent).
The AfD would first be 14 percent in the Deputy House.
With 5 percent, the ADP could hope to return the pirates would be contrary to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in timelupe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The followers today dominate the world - his producers made a deaster.
The device was almost half kilogram and was more than four times as hard as a iPhone 5.
It was dicker and greater, so it wasn't well in the hand.
In contrast, it was very obvious.
The constructed memory was first eight megabytes, which would today be rich for about two selfies with high solution.
A iPhone is equipped with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, in business - and it was the first smartphone.
For some euros, favorites can buy the devices in the Internet, but they are some of the rock time of the Internet.
However, 20 years ago, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone producer had announced the product a few months before the computer cebit in Hannover as "Büro in Westentasche format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could have been able to be sent and received by Fax, as well as the Communicator.
Even the access to the web site was possible by HTML browser as well as slowly.
A tailer was available, a digital address book and a electronic calendar.
There was a small foundation, and the mobile could be touched like a laptop.
Then a small key and a black wheel screen.
Indeed, the price was of 2700 D-Mark, so approximately 1400 euros.
The average sale price of a smartphone in Germany was in 2015 at 392 euros.
No one could say in August 1996 that the Communicator of the start of the Smartphone Eras would be.
Since everything is different.
The clue phones are a success history, even not for Nokia.
The telephone section of the feet experienced a deaster without playing, finally sold and developed to Microsoft.
The market manage today providers who are all more later than Nokia.
Being online and everywhere, this is for many people today.
2015 there was about two billion Smartphone number worldwide.
It was sold approximately 1,4 billion devices, Samsung and Apple, only 555 million pieces.
The global exchange with the devices is about 400 billion euros.
This is the good business of non-numerable app providers and the telecommunication concerts.
Run around the smartphone has been a whole industry.
The decisive breakfast to the mass market came first beginning of 2007, and Apple Chef Steve Jobs announced on the Mac-World introduction of the iPhone.
He spoke three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and a Internet communicationsger, easy to use everything via Touch screen.
Apple's trip started, yet today the iPhone is the most important product of the conzern.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who controlled the market, had the search.
Finally, blaberry has to fight.
The words now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The Smartphone is a self-detection 20 years after his exercise.
At the end, every German looks at its mobile 88 times today.
"We all have to learn to get off the smartphone even once again," said Janina Kugel, in the Siemens term for staff responsible.
Permanent availability shall apply to average as a fluid and blessing.
England must lower the olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring not only into our local communities and throughout London, but also in the whole country renewing and prosperity.
For me, this was the greatest Heathrows attraction in London, as well as once in 2012, when we worked a great stage to ensure that all our nations and regions have benefited from the games.
Olympiade offered great benefits for Stratford and the eastern End.
And this will be reached by creating new opportunities for local and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will only create 10,000 new teachers, 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport.
As they had passed for us in London 2012, it will give them those who will think that the challenge of Heathrows is too large.
I was told that England would never be prepared for the games and that we'll be blamed on the world's bottles.
The seconds had injustice in 2012 and they will also lie to Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question.
As the Olympic games is Heathrow for many and not for individual infrastructure projects.
The extension is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion to white growth and to reduce capacity and employment as well as to leave airports and throughout the GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion by infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5, the five years in follow-up to the best airport end of the world until T2, which was built within the two most of the world's biggest rates.
Now they are ready to provide a third rate, which is supported by £16 billion in private investments.
Londra's games in 2012 were a great success for GB and I am sure that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time that we lay down this olympic spirit and extend Heathrow and ensure our future trade and create a weakness of firms and employment that can be bound by England.
Lord Paul Deighton is President of the Heathrow Boards and former Trade Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Katz and Mouse" game concerning display blocking
For firms winning money with online delivery, according to one of the software producers trials to lock the display blocking, a "Katz and mouse game".
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block show blocks on his desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blogpost in which applications could upgrade their filters in the program to block again publication in social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook informed that his desktop site would change the code on its advertising notices, to recognize the concept of which part of the page advertising is to be advertised.
But Adblock announced that there was a new way to move the new codes.
In a Blogpost, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "the kind of Hin- and-Her-Campa between the opened Community and the survey already since the creation of show-blockers is in the Gange," and that Facebook is possible soon with a new solution.
The fact that the world's greatest company for social media has entered into the fight is a strong Indian on how careful government blows have been made for the industry.
Using a study from the last year of Page Fair and Adobe about 200 million people showing blockers, almost four times so many 2013.
With 1,03 billion active users daily access to Facebook via their mobile finger devices, 84 percent of the admissions of Facebook.
The company did not have any effect on Facebooks mobile app for the social network and instagram.
Publication on Desktop PCs provides a sufficient share of revenues so Facebook appears that the investment of such a step as a loans value.
On Tuesday, Facebook informed that it would be updated to make people more controls on them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks would be careful for new filters because they would also block content on the page which are not an advertising.
"For users it does not provide positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," shared a Facebook speaker in an email communication.
Show-blockers are a flood fund, so we have focused on developers' tools like Ad preferences to put more controls in the hands of people.
Women's with a chance of self-admitting on Swiss car
The victim was in midnight on the carway.
The police calls for witnesses after a woman had been moved on Thursday on Thursday with a vulnerable self-use of several vehicles on a car road.
The case occurred on the A1 near Morges in Kanton Waadt shortly after the north.
A woman put on the street in the darks "in an act of disappearance" on the street and was taken by several cars, the police said in Waadt.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman who was old of 49 years, including a car was overcoming, wanted to kill himself.
She's still gone out of the place.
Several drivers have already been identified, but some have not yet been identified, the police said that they and all witnesses of the case were requested to report themselves.
There was an explanation procedure opened which is a "local" step in such a situation, participated in Gilles Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains expected if one of the drivers is shown.
Was a cohesion unable?
That's something that the State Defender must decide," said the Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not responsible.
In each of the two cases, where a person moved to the carway, was decided that the car cars should not get out of the fact that a footer walks middle of the night on the carway, as it said in the newspaper.
Last year, a policeist was discovered of the forced murder after she had overcome a man and killed the A1 night in August 2014 near Pairne.
The 22-year-old sacrifice was drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court was taken.
The court stated that the police - who had responded to an urgency - had been justified and justified, and that the presence of a man on the road was an "external and unprecedented situation", the judge said.
Any other information on the case of the event on Thursday near Morges should be reported to the police under point 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44.
NASA Klimaamodell: Venus was one of the most available
The Venus was probably one of the most useful projects of a NASA Klimaamodell.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Students of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms, such as climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have shown one of the same conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-divers atmospheres.
Scientists previously pointed out that the slow reverse of Venus could be explained by their deep atmosphere.
But the latest simulation states that Venus could have had a dark, dark atmosphere and even slowly disappeared.
The model also lighted the topografie of the early Venus.
The planet probably opened more dry areas than the earth, but had the first enough water and geographical variable to hide life and protect from rapid disappearance.
The early Venus also benefited from a 30 percent of the sun.
"In the GISS models, Venus has exposed its sun page for almost two months," GISS scientists Anthony De Genio said in a press communication.
This strengthens the surface and produces rain that creates a dick shape clouds, which operates like a rain screen to shoot the surface of a large part of the sun warming.
The results are average temperatures which are some degrees cute than those of the earth today.
The model introduced a history of Venus, similar to the evolution, which was tempted by planet researchers before.
Although she was most likely usual, the Venus was in the course of more billion years -- too many heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans were disappeared and their water clothes were burned from the ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogens were evacuated only a dinner atmosphere of carbonoxide with a death-house effect -- the Venus, as we know them today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus Klimamodells in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy acts as a trainer of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy became a trainer and Vice President of Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche on Thursday and made a low-related right to the decision process of the team.
Alternativ President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the agreement will be searching immediately for a new trainer.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my obligations as Chairman and Vice President of Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, suffering and disability," said the 50-year-old Roy.
I was thinking long and many of how I could improve this team in order to give him more levels that it needs and to bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the Trainer and Vice President of Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly assigned to the organization.
It must also have a right of co-ordination in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions shall not be fulfilled at the moment.
Sakic, who had earned Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick has informed me today about this decision," said Sakic.
We appreciate what he did for our organization and wish him for the future only the best.
Roy was designed during his work at the Avalanches 2013-14 as the winner of Jack Adams Awards as the best trainer of the Liga.
He brought the Convention at 112 points and the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was killed at the first round of the playoffs of Minnesota and passed the aftersaison in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches marked a 39-39-4 brand in the Saison 2015-16 and fell behind the wild for a second Wildcard Spot in the Western Conference about five points back.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy had four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Canadiens and the Avalanche.
Northern employees take again discussions, drawing out stress
Working wars relating to the deployment of northern oil workers will be implemented while all the parties of the battle for a new conversation course on the table said negotiators.
Streiks against the oil field service barrier Wood Group were performed sporadly on platforms in the north sea operating by Royal Dutch Shell.
"When a group and the United Nations and RMT offices can confirm that we have been forced to restart the process of the current fight," it says in a common explanation.
We will stop some complete meetings in the next weeks that will begin the beginning of the next year to resolve the problems.
The officers said that their last street, which is the first in 25 years, was a test against possible loan operations from up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut the Councils to his contractors in the North Sea around 9 per cent because of negative market pressure.
The rate of the company is 10 percent decline for Onshore recipients in 2014.
The company said that additional shortcomings were given to the company the necessary space to come through the decline of the market.
Shell has decided for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to provide its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries, since it is rationalised by its business activities as a result of his mega-based meetings with the British Energy Company BG Group.
Energy undertakings are based on the lower prices of road oil, increased by the decision of the Brits in June, the European Union.
The Schott Parliament Member Dave Anderson met with employees this week to discuss one of the greatest jobs held since a generation in the north sea.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the northern sea and the whole country we need a economy that operates for many and not only for little," he said in an exhibition.
2016, less than $1,4 billion for expenditures for new projects in the northern Sea are waiting for average about $7 billion in the last five years.
Beautiful rotation race of stars in the starbage of the top
The latest mission with the Quepler World Space Telescope has helped to collect Astronoms to the fullest catalogue at rotation roads under the stars of the stars of the Almighty.
The new data helps to understand the astronoms why stars are rolling in the star roads and where the rotation periods are with the planet growth.
"We hope that by comparison of our results with other stars, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his sun system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Process and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press communication.
The stars of the Most Highs are 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this starbage, which risen about 125 million years ago, are now reaching the adult age.
Now you're moving faster.
These road stars have increased large amounts of star winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic areas of the stars, they have a breathing effect on the stars.
If a star changes, his rotation race begins to be shot.
Together, it misses the rotation rate of every star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognised starflower flower -- like sunflowers.
The last catalogue of rotation wheels shows that massive stars are slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with tanks, with larger stars of slow pirouettes as smaller.
"Im "Ballet" of the Most Univers we see that the long roads are to be massive, where the faster roads are to be very light," said Rebull.
As the star road is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare more star qualitys such as rotation wheels.
"The stars of the top offers an anker for theoretical models of the star rotation in both directions, younger and elder," said Rebull.
It is still much about what we want to learn more about how this, when and why stars require their rotation roads and then turn their "tangling".
Rebull and their colleagues have reported out in three new reports of their recent analysis of the highest rotation rates which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A overwhelming Baseball Star
The dreams travel faster than Alex Rodriguez in best days of Base to Base.
Following his emotional disappearances, the 41-year-old Profi is the last time the Trikot of his New York Yankee.
"I love this game and this team."
"I'm saying 'Goodbye' on bothm," said the 14-time all-Star Game Teilers of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times Rodriguez was chosen to the most precious player of the Liga, 2009 he received the World Series with the Yankees.
His subtitle under a ten-year contract provided to him for 27 million dollars since 2007.
To the end of the contract, on 31 December 2017, he was the future as a consultant and youth coach, in full holding.
As a player, it paid a long time back with performance.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and Yankees made some miles of stones since 2005.
With the Hall-off-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays only show two other Baseball players in the most important statistics similar values.
Nevertheless, the 41-year-olds should not be taken in the bar of the Baseball.
For so successful Rodriguez - Splitname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so surrounding is his attitude outside the place.
In 2009, the Superstar was allowed to take steroids prohibited between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, it was closed for 211 Parts on a development in so-called biogenesis candle to end 2014.
Rodriguez is applicable as a principal deputy, for years through an anti-atging clinic in South-Florida performance funds.
After a legal basis, the Sperre was still reduced to 162 meetings.
"The Liga could even have done a pleasure for the 2014, because I've played 20 years without pause," Rodriguez said sometimes.
Its disaster's day also is not slowly lost.
During many Baseball leaders in their last games, Rodriguez had to be seated often on the bank.
"My job does not contain a departure tower."
"My job includes the trial to win every game," lady Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.
Rodriguez, who was married with the player Cameron Diaz and was considered the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the player Kate Hudson, sympathy bindings from Yankee-Errivale Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the applicants sang at the 4:9 node of the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Indeed: means of a positive Doping test cannot start adrian targetinski from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympian games 2016 are overviewed by the first official doping cases.
A consequent athletin would almost win a medal.
The first official doping cases have been known by Olympian games in Rio de Janeiro before the seventh day.
The Chinese summerin Chen Xinyi, 3000 meters-thinderniscanquisite Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polynian weight Adrian Zielinski were discovered positive and excluded in Brazil - directly before the beginning of the Critical Live-Lectic Watchtower.
Chen was already shown in the past Sunday the diureticum hydrochlorothiazid was used as a maskive resource for Doping Substanties.
The International Sport Guest Court of CAS confirmed its conclusion of the Olympic games on Tuesday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-year-old had the fourth place at the end of more than 100 meters, only 0,09 seconds, and the Bronzemedaille was pushed.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the projects over 50 m of free style.
Chen asked for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) the opening of B test and an hearing.
The National Trade takes the question "such serious and requests a full cooperation in the investigations", held by Xinhua: "We will work together with the International Sport Guest Court of CAS and accept the judgment."
The first time in the story is not the IOC but the CAS for sanctioning the sporters with positive cases.
Anyway, in the night of Rio, the message of the positive test at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went into the opening.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," that was "unglazing shock," she said to the white TV-Sender BNT.
It is unschuldable, "the only declaration could be food-related," said the easy atletin.
In accordance with the report, it should be conducted in the prohibited substance of the EPO blood dumping.
Danekowa has been expectedly, as BNT also needs to be outlined positively.
President Bojko Borissow, President of Bulgaria, directly reported to the Athletin's words with critics.
"I don't understand why the sporters don't take the right clash," he said, "We are under observation, so many have been excluded."
Thus, all the weighters of the chronic duping chargers may not participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, as his brother Tomasz had been visited a positive three days before the anabbased Steroid Nandrolon.
Boths shall prevent the receipt, but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the easy acts, the case Danekowa is a further severe gun for reputation of all sports types.
The IAF World Trade had undertaken the complete Russian manager to except through systemtic dopings the start, also produced Kenia shopping many bad news in Rio.
Furthermore, the previous stakeholders in China for strong disputes were also provided between the Athletes.
So the French Camille Lacourt took the Chinese Olympiasian Olympicer Sun Yang.
"Your Yang paint lily."
"If I see the podium over 200 meters of free style, I'll be delivered," said Lacourt in French radio.
Sun also standed in the middle of a comparison with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for Doping Defender," said this.
Sun was presented in 2014 with the Chinese masters on the stimulans trimetazidin, but only a three-monthic sperre had to be disappeared.
Data class: Thus perfided Hacker pressed their lion money
The programers of repressing software are currently targeted by enterprises - and are successful.
According to the current survey of Malware-spezialists Malwarebytes under 540 enterprises in North America, British and Germany, 40 percent of the requested companies in the last 12 months, more of the victims of an attack with an erpressive software.
In Germany, about 20 percent of the company had already been a target of ransomware expression.
40 percent of the victims were ready to pay the leather requested by the cells to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The thresholds specialize their emphasis software according to the observations of Malwarebytes attractions in firm networks.
If it is successful there, the potentially affecting leather money is significantly higher than in private uses.
"We are currently watching a huge fast evolution of the Schadsoftware", says Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "Women".
2008, most Malware Programs were still designed to send advertisement.
Then the tables discovered the software for themselves.
The first goal of private users were the goal, but the weight to business attacks was rapidly hurt over the past months.
Ransomware is working on a simple template: once active on the computer of a victim, it is looking for renewed files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as to archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and remove the originals sustainable.
Following this, the software represents the demands of the Erpressors.
To get the end-encryption code to the files, the victims of money have to be transferred in the form of the Bitcoin Cryptowship.
However, where private uses the personal photo data bank is on the game, it is in firms about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production will be still.
Indeed, the damage is higher when a ransommware is attacked.
22 percent of the German company concerned reported exchange losses by ransomware, 13 per cent had to even completely interrupt business activity, in a case people in life-related risk.
In Germany, several of the victims of attacks were already affected by loss of hospitals.
"We're always saying to the victims: don't pay, you're only fostering the problem," Kleczynski says.
However, 80 to 90 percent of the companies paying receive their data again.
For manager, it is difficult to decline the demand of the tanks in the operation.
The Hacker knows this again and try to build a good reputation.
In a current study, the security researchers of F-Secure have studied the user area and contact with the emphasis and have come to the result: the machines are actually trying to build a type of customer service to take more money.
They explain their victims by chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, make a free accessible support sites one or decrypted using the most example files.
And private persons will be solved after payment of few hundreds of euros, enterprises have to negotiate hardly and pay five-numeric amounts to return their data unencrypted.
In view of the potentially high and relatively unrealised benefits from ransomware expression, the Hacker will always be engaged and shared in the work, explains security expert Chester Wisneywski from the Antivirus provider Sophos: "A individual person can write a ransomware about a week."
However, it is likely that it is about three or four persons.
The programers then sell their shopping software in the form of a software case to the actual emphasis.
The present malware kits were seen by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a single, fixed price between 1000 and $10,000.
"The delivery part is an adaptation tool so that smaller configuration, view and blocking can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The empires are then looking for further hackers to disseminate the fresh buyed software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you are logged in one of the Fores in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and provides another to install the software on the most possible of many PCs.
The payment is carried out for infected computer.
"Of course, the crimes are overcome with the dissemination", says Wisniewski.
The risk of ransomware is among others known in many enterprises that ensure their data better.
More than 50 percent of the company-IT responsibilities in the Malwarebytes Request to allow Ransomware to disappear file-ups and scanner-software.
Of course, the thresholds have already followed new strategys.
"When the encryption of data is not only sufficiently damage for successful consideration, the cells follow with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," says Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski.
This is the damage potential, according to the type of data, a lot more higher than before.
The thorns could also take completely new objectives in the Internet of things to corn.
At the Hacker Conference Defcon, security researchers have been demonstrated, as they could receive a thermostat related to the Internet.
In the middle of the winter, the free maintenance of a sort-blocked heat could be valued by some victims from a lone payment.
If the cells then block a whole set of preparation in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a subject in industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and every day
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to take all: a little SUV, a little couped and even the diversity of a ministry.
King is quite overloaded, but the HR-V, built on the same new platform as the new jazz, is actually shown as flexible every day.
Although only 1,60 m high HR-V more small, the passengers have been in the first line and in the foundation a lot of place, it does not work at any place.
The materials of the internal space are well processed and acted, only the Cockpit site leaves something.
Multilaterally than comparable vehicles is HR-V at the stauraum.
It is available not only a quarter of 453 l at high and 1026 l for overlaid back, but there are the "Magic Seats".
It's less slow than it sounds: the seats of the backbank will be mounted as kinossels and offers a stauraum from the ground to the cock 1.24 m high.
The carrier room can be loaded well, however, the load height of 650 mm is some more high than when comparable Peugeot 2008.
The dedicated 1.6-l-Thesel with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates HR-V by the HR motion from up to 300 Nm in far-record numbers.
Yet, he needed to make something leader.
The daily consumption of 4,7 l/100 km.
There is another engineering: a 1,5-l benzins with 96 kW/130 PS.
A alrand tribe is not offered.
Training is equipped, a good compromise between dynamic and comfort.
But the lending should be something more direct.
The exhibition does not wish to open in the shown Top Valution "Executive".
The City Notbrem Assistant (working up to time 32), the collection warm system and the spring assistant.
The Collission Warner is sometimes irritating because it assess many obstacles as "heranasing objects".
Several reliable work is the telelimitist.
And the intelligent timeregler reacts to the identification of transport signs and drasselt when needs the speed.
The full connection is only for the top exhibition: 7-Zoll touch screens, Navi, App integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI books are under the arms and are therefore something to achieve.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-developed top is okay.
Whoever does not want to invest so much will receive the Benzinger from 20000 euros, this is from 23000 euros.
The engines fill the euro-6 gas standard.
With HR-V Honda, Honda offers a multi-party and everyday car.
Airline does not stop: Airgast pressure
A airline does not arrest a passagier on the airport pressure.
Since an appeal is only thinkable in danger that are typically for air transport, the Supreme Competitor Düsseldorf argued (As.: 18 U 124/14).
The complainant had broken a knife at the storm.
However, the case could happen everywhere - it was a general risk of life, the court.
The airline should not have paid to the man.
The case of sickness: If the student pays
The patients who are sick after their trip will only be back to money if the cause of the disease is unfortunately found in the hotel.
But this is only the case when more than ten percent of guests show the same symptoms.
In the case of negotiated, a family was in the second day of its Turkish vacation was seriously sick in accidents and crimes.
She almost had the whole holiday in the room.
Their disease, the vacants, have returned to a defect clargy, which probably had polluted the sea water.
The family was thinking that the trip was unlawful to this - and was rebelled against the agency.
The complaints had no success before the court.
Besides, the clark was indeed defected.
However, the Institute found a short time before the complainant's dealing out of it.
He had to find out that the sea was okay.
He therefore did not have his information obligations, the judgment.
At least, no contaminations were found in the tests of the water.
The disease of several hotel hosts - whereas it is possible by relaxing each other - listed to the general risk of life.
From 691 guests, only 38 were sick.
The Maizière said that after the warrants of violence in Würzburg and the attack in July, many people would be worried about further attacks.
The State must approximately respond to terrorism.
Surely, our country will not respond to the violence of the thorns with hate and disappearance.
This triumph is not going to deal with the terrorists.
If criminals have to leave the country faster, the security and reinforcement of the population of refugees should also be increased.
The Maziière wants to implement the proposals until the Federal Section 2017.
He also announced another personal strengthening of security forces, "in average four-year size regulation".
The sympathy of terrorism should be again subject to criminality.
Video supervision will be improved that the law of arms will be notified so that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the Internet will be enhanced.
The last many discussioned duty obligation for doctors should remain in keeping after the Mazaj words.
However, he wants to seek solutions in the dialogue with the doctor, how the danger of citizens could be reduced, he said about psychic opposites.
In order to participate in racialization of refugees, the Minister will take a better social concern for the need.
Learning forces should be better prepared on the transition with traumatised people.
For persecution of crimes in specific areas of the Internet (Dangnet) Maizière plants the use hidden Ermittler.
SPD-Chef Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to speak about everything that is intended to increase the security."
It is important that the Internal Minister has clearly spoken against actionism.
"It was an earlier for the clothes in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel said the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (First Day).
The Maizière had reiterated a call from the Union after a burka prohibition and the abolition of the double nationality.
A general prohibition of full disappearance is a matter of constitutional law.
You can't prevent everything you're dismissed, and I'm leaving the burka stage.
It is possible to speak about rules such as in the road movement or for the Witnesses.
Green-Chefin Simone Peter warned the Minister, he wanted to simulate with the new anti-terror package power and conductability.
Left-Partec Bernd Riexinger said: "Flottes and an enhancement of the right of residence brings people to this country no longer security."
Best transport flows on the car wheel
It was regularly on the road of transition - here is a picture of November.
However, this should be changed: the legal abbiepur must be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers who stand on the environment road every evening in the stain when they go over the car road (A 43).
The country-based road construction extends the next Sunday and Wednesday (16./17 August) in the area between the Hammer Street and the Weseler Street, the legal abbiegerspur around 700 meters.
Then cars can directly fill from the hair road right.
The great advantage: the transport is in the early time, and the overall end is improved in the multi-related section of the Federal Tray 51.
The idea with the extended outcome had the CDU Group in the Munster Woest divorced.
The driver's car rental moves on the driver, especially between 17 and 19 hours.
The day of work the backstap will be able to press over the albersloor, and sometimes also outside it.
That's why the Nadelöser is shortly on B 51 before the departure of Weseler road.
From here, the transport is only indirectly on the car ticket.
The second screen had to be rebuildinged before the end of the year.
The reason: Statistical calculations had indicated that the press was no longer having the needed trag force to take a double purifying the burden movement.
As long as this approach and the employment rate related to this, the competent country operation cannot say.
Nevertheless, it is to be calculated with years: for the press has an official retail period until 2034.
In order to extend the legal abuse, the country company has noted the highest time of transport in schools because it is estimated with disabilities.
The transport is conducted on Sunday and on middle at the building.
Intercultural travel: Cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the theatre property "The invisible house".
The Verein Nima's and the boy theater are now planning a music project.
The Verone Nima's allows youths to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "class International" of the Wald School Children House has visited a presentation of the priceful part of the "The Invisible House" of the boy Theaters Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Travel" initiated by the Verein Nima's "Intercultural Travel" 19 students visited the inscension in the small house between 11 and 15 years.
Since the beginning of the year, the agreement, which set up the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee, is the objective of schools with welcome classs, will be able to visit cultural institutions within the framework of this project in Münster.
Most young people of the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, among others from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and talked little German.
However, the choregraphy, scene pictures and video animations had been possible to follow the course of action, so the press communication of the young theaters Munster.
The Verein Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprrakel, and the boy's teater will work in the coming time of playing in a music theater project.
From October to December, youths must receive the possibility of visiting professional courses in the fields of speech, tanz, play and music from 14 to 20 years.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre game and theatrale speech delivery are planning.
The "Intercultural Travel" project continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the agreement with many classs who want to participate.
Rain instead of stars: hope on weather improvement
The weather has made the stars of skills in South Western Germany in the night to Friday a street through the account, but there is still hope.
The night was bad about clouds and rains to watch the sky spectrum, the President of the star Warzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Tuesday morning.
Our hope is in the night on Saturday.
The weather will be good, then we'll see a lot of stars in the sky.
The stars are persediates with 216000 kilometres per hour to the fastest swimmings.
They have their names because they appear from the star image of Perseus, which comes on the north east.
Awful night: Tips against sleepings
By night you'll be around around, night you're laughing up, tomorrow is not to think about sleep.
That's all the other thing as possible.
However, with such problems are in good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, a quarter of adult sleepings has been made and more than ten% recommended their sleep often or sustainable than not.
How are sleeping problems or sleeping disappearances?
There are several forms of sleeping disappearances, and they can have a lot of causes, focusing on Hans-Genge Weight, the term member of the German society for sleep research and dream medicine.
What you understand landlessly, but insomonia is, so a dreaming and sleeping.
In fact, the breakfast recommends many people as unfriendly or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, Condition member in the German home contract with Praxis in the lowland Varel.
What's going after sleepings?
The causes of dreams are complex.
Inter alia, organic, psychic or maintenance factors can steal, but also medicine.
Not rarely the breakfast of sleep is the expression of another disease.
"More early watch is especially often at a depression," says Week.
And it may be that different factors are sleeping each other.
For example, who has a band ship case can lie badly, waiting for two to three hours and then starts to smooth over all dinner problems and skills, there is an example of weight.
This leads to relaxation, and sleep is not yet possible.
From when should you get sleeping to the doctor?
If you have a period of a month in at least three nights per week not sleeping and worried on the day, you should go to the doctor.
The disappearance can be seen very different: you are struck, mocked, disappeared, have difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily revealable, has smoking events or physical disasters such as magen or heads.
In order to leaving the sleeping, it is important to find out whose causes.
As treatment options, among other behaviour changes, cognitive behaviour or medically - classic sleeptables only in the exception and highest for two weeks.
The lower bed medicine is in Germany, betont Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep center of the Charity University Medicine Berlin.
This is why you should first turn to the household with problems of sleeping, as well as food.
It can explain whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who'd be in bed, and what's going on?
For the study in the bed work, the medicines, for example, in snowing with atematics, in sick daily patience, in sleepers or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disappearance, explains fietces.
There is no need to be prepared for the investigation.
You should make the day normal.
"Let you don't have to sleep in the middle of the morning," says Fietze.
After the box, you're in bed at his normal time.
Besides the electricals on the body, a nest brown, a bridge, and a fever on the finger.
Furthermore, a camera puts the beds on the cover.
How can those concerned get the problems in the griff?
There are a lot of places in which you can add for better sleep.
Whatever means: Regular sleeping and upper-times, not too long sleeping in bed, not sleeping in the day, not far away to sleep, alcool mys and don't look at the night - then you're starting to count immediately, and it's all and not forbidden.
What the dungal camp has with miserable medals in the weakness
The former German swimming pool Markus Deibler has exposed to Olympis with Facebook the enthusiastic disagreement of the DSV team.
In December 2014, he took gold at the short-term world offices in Doha first, and put up its first World Record at the same time.
Now the former DSV atlet Markus Deibler has defended his former teams in the critic.
"In a country where a olympiasee receives a premium and a twice of $150,000 should not be wondered about misfortuned medicines," the 26-year-olds in the night on Friday on his Facebook page.
The promoting system is bad and the Doping Controls are very good.
This is why we can't competite with countries which are very much to promote and doping's topic is not so accurately or even to do it.
"I don't say that the controls should be put here," he continued.
He wanted to start a comeback, to be informed about nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency, Germany (NADA).
It should also be held with countries.
"When any time is not able to be controled by WM/OS of independent WADA/FINA controllers, it cannot be part of the election Hamburger, which is in the middle of a railway.
Airport: fixed packet bands
Professional Denbe at the Airport Düsseldorf
Thursday, two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years were civilians of the Düsseldorfer police.
Those defenders began a few bands of tackles and bags.
Further than 21:30, civil officers recognized again a band that was known to the policemen from the past furniture disasters.
Two women and two men have started several delicts since mid July this year and have been engaged in the Community, working and specially professional.
The Specialists of the Criminal Commissioner 34 may demonstrate four acts to address criminals to Germany.
They had over 15,000 euros.
High buildings, a few linen woods, between a rest of head stones: The Rigaer Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain is not on the first view, but the police counts it to the "related places" of the city.
If you're going on the street from east to West, you're going to play spaces, a fresh children's garden and a bioload.
Somebody looked at the Fassade of a green house.
On the contrary to a member that will also be discovered, it is already built: until 2017 there is a house of high windows and 133 new food apartments.
Articles concerning this "third city share", as the responsible real estate of Friedrichshain is called, but in the past few weeks are preferred with breathing cars.
For the reason it is the house with number 94: one was set, in the middle of the inhabitants, in the ground, there are still rooms and used for events.
Specially the Inensensator Henkel has spoken for a hard attack of the police against the project, which was designed as the "No-Go-Zone" for policeists and the 94 as a starting point of autonom violence.
After 22 June, the rooms in the landscape, which were celebrated by 300 police officers, the police had retained three weeks of official experts by 30 to 40 officers and three manager cars on place, cut parts of the road and kept visitors to attend the house number 94.
During renewed construction workers at the command of the unknown household the rooms.
On 13 July, a manager of Berlin decided that the ruling was illegal, and a day later, the police and the workers were held under the jubile of sympathistics and inhabitants.
On this summer afternoon, the road is peacefully operating: parents are going to walk with children, people sitting on the steel before the homes in the sun, others keep the form of the late.
A basic school and child markets are directly near the house projects.
Left violence is not the main care of many inhabitants: Kerstin new constructioner who lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, which is a larger one of three children here, are particularly the presence of the police.
With the residents of the household projects, they share the concern of increased food and geneticization.
It doesn't seem to be a choice that most of the police's protection of the lefts.
The grave which the inevitator of Berlin and the police between households and their neighbors is not so clear.
Friedrichshain in Eastern Berlin was actually a traditional worker, which also has a low medium agreement and high poverty risk today.
Also, home provisions and living projects have been born for a long time to select: 1990, numerous houses were appointed in the former DDR, including nearly all the mainzer street near the rigaer.
Much of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized under the large police offer in a regular road fashion, and today they were part of the people who had been engaged in 26 years ago.
At the same time, the city share has become increasing to the magnets of tourists and electoral liners from the world: with them, inhabitants of DDR weathers and former household owners are shared with their choice.
This also takes note of the foods increased since 2009 in refrigerations by almost 60 per cent.
Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer will be attacked as symbols for this development: you can recognize them on infilled grass or fresh fass that were designed with color-sufficients.
No other street has been mentioned this year so often with the words "link autonome violence".
A reason that not all neighbourers may be that they are not inevitably affected by criminality: criminals such as corporal crime are statistics almost exclusively against police.
The largest part of the criminals exhibit drugs which tend to meet the new constructions and fresh renovated houses.
For Kerstin's new constructioner, living in a mixed house by the 94 surroundings, there cannot be a speech of uncertainty for 17 years.
With regard to violence, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbors, who were not determined.
The famous cars also have no longer given it in the rigaer.
For the studyed architectine, its road is no criminal brenn point, in contrast: "There is helping each other, living together on the street and get more than wherever."
New buildingers are known to the rigaer road - and remained.
Therefore, it was so important that the inhabitants returned their roads: from the police, the policy and the media, who were all in July at the same time called on the city's part.
However, in the eyes of residents like new constructioners, the road will continue to take them: by viewless reconstructions in ancient buildings that disappear the old inhabitants.
"They are finally owners who are not interested for many here - here dwell more people who don't visit so well," she says.
"Manage and disastering I can't absolutely pronounce."
But what do you want to do if someone ever listens?
This places for all pages of flagration, also for the police and the inhabitants.
For added ones who are hungry about colorbooms, Kerstin new constructioners has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene are part of the kitchen.
He who comes out should be aware of him - just like someone who goes into a neck quarter can be worse there about the laughing.
All persons presented with the names only have asked not to be called in their right name
Urbach: Annika Godchle is a new refugee payment
Annika Godchle is the interview partner in business integration and organization.
In addition, she is social worker.
Since July, Annika Godchle is the refugee payment for Urbach.
The Social Pädagogin supports the management team for Ahim Grockenberger.
It seems to be a complaint for all actors: refugees, workcree of refugees, management, authorities and others missed.
Regine customers state that the honorable persons are more grateful than that Godchle is now, the weird Wollmilchsau, which has mostly a problem.
Thus, some - less spontanely than much more on the number of tasks in the skills, were designed, when the management wanted to describe the position.
A manager force was visited with a talent for languages and people related to a long-year experience in the social work, as well as an outstanding Wollmilchsau.
However, management work is not its central area, Annika Godchle.
In particular, it is about organization, work with people on the place, as well as behind the skins and the network activity.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It was a 50 percent rate for three years.
"It was the highest time," says Regine Client that Annika Godchle is supporting the principal actors.
There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding.
Balls are new containers in the washing trace
A serious problem is for some time to find apartments for final flowers who are recognized.
The communities shall be responsible for the conclusion.
You need to undertake the refugees in your own or allowed living rooms.
The costs for construction, honey or renovation of these accommodations must bear the communities themselves.
The response changes from the Council on Commons and Working Centres.
Problem: There are free objects, but not each owner wants to offer its apartment.
The search has been made for some time as very difficult.
The fact does not find private apartments.
It doesn't work until now, so Godchle has been shown on private accommodations.
Therefore, common apartments are needed to be made as well as it is beautiful.
So the new containers are soon designed in the washing trail.
But only with apartments it wasn't done.
Perspective is the word, Regine customers and Annika Godchle are unique.
Besides a festival, there are practical places, training facilities, schools, one-euro-jobs and exhibition activities for refugees and migrants that must be found or established.
"That would be good places," reported Regine Kunde.
Many work in the building area or help housemasters, who have common work - and it is motivated and very ordinary, as Annika Godchle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external impact.
This is "no employment therapy".
The work is not only a job.
The day you need a festival structure, telling Godchle and customer.
People must develop a feeling of nationality.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with home and especially speech courses.
Professional courses are rare.
This is how to get manager and honorable here.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are encountered and welcomed in Germany.
The long time of the procedure is a problem.
They need to explain to the refugees that it is long and that they can specify the time reasonably, for example with speech courses.
If anyone develops the feeling, he can't help anyone in Urbach, it should not work and be inutil, it will never be integrated.
The clear majority is motivated.
However, there are also problems, says customers honestly, "lease where nothing happens."The work of divine and customers is therefore always to motivate others.
All this is a "Mammutation".
A difficult question: are the two of them in the recent events fearing racialization, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," Regine Client says very clear, "What some of them may be called naive." A restrival can, but you don't want to exclude it.
It's sensitivised if the help is already.
These cases are also the subject of refugees.
They would have feared that the attractors were fully calling them.
"You want to show that they don't have anything to do so," says Regine Client.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
It is therefore necessary to keep main and honorates on the place and in the region for the explanation of activities.
They have always found that a new weight of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany make a high limit?
It is clear to answer this question.
In fact, it's unfair to make them help.
"In Urbach we haven't come to where we're going to get", says Annika Godchle.
No new refugees, that would resolve the situation.
Regine customers also makes clear that the urbanists are also designed to integrate the current people.
These are now about 100 people, overwhelming young men.
But if people are in need, you should help them, both women are unique.
It is so complicated that there is no simple answers.
