Imperial Chinese / Requests
The Chinese Social Network TikTok has the prices of video-related videos, which are mentioned by the Tunian area, the independence of Tibeta or the prohibited religious group of Falunguan, tells The Guardian.
The documents mentioned in the publication indicated that the owner of TikTok (BatteDance Communities) has moved the objectives of the external policy for China outside the country.
The main part of violations relating to China's policies falls under "abortion."
In each case, TikTok provides unprofit publications in the context of the general rules to ensure that social network actions should not be cleared.
For example, prohibition at the critic of the social system of China is under the general prohibition of “Critics or attacks on policies and social rules of any country, such as the Constitutional Monarchy, Parliamentary System, etc.”.
The prohibition of the incidents on the Thyaminan or Genozide area in Cambodia is under "Cambodia's history of China or other countries".
The document also contains a list of the names prohibited by the twentieth " national leaders or State Deputys," including the northern Chin Ira, Kim Ir Sean and Kim Chin, the Indian policy of Mahatma Ganda, the President of Donald Trump and Barbaka Obama, the Japanese Primeer of Sindso Abe, the South Korean President of Pack Kin Hin, the President of Joo Vido and the Indian Premier Narrador Modi, as set out in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories as set out in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by the Associate Administrators and may be blocked by the user.
The second category of violations are not too series of violations: such publications remain on the web, but their proliferation is limited by TikTok.
The representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules were set up and no longer apply: "We are currently used to modify a localized approach, as well as to the independent local specialists."
The Russian user TikTok has no special limitations for publication, tells the Foundation of the Prostitution Centre by the Royal Goddan.

It is agreed with the founder of the Office of Our Didgital Roman Zarifs: "The fundamental rules for users of TikTok are renumbered in the user's agreement: you can't set a spot containing discrimination and further."
However, under these rules, any account that doesn't like modelers is not known to the Rules.
The Zarippo Agency is another Russian partner TikTok.
According to TikTok, its number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of which are less than 18 years old.
By the user agreement, you can use TikTok only persons older 13 years.
Society administrators check their ages through an artificial intellectual integer. It analyses the persons and determines how many years a person looks like, tell Goddans.
If the neutrality decides that the poorer user can remove his accent, he adds.
