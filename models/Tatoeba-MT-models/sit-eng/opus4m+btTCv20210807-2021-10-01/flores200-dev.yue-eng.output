People hit with a chair, but the window is not broken.
The survivors, Francis Coval, said, “One of the glass was finally broken, and they began to escape from the window.”
Stars can produce light and heat because when zinc atoms are fusioned together to form more heavy elements, they generate energy.
Scientists are working on creating a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
However, this problem is very difficult to solve, and it takes years to build a useful polymer reactor.
Steel needles are floating on the surface of the water because of the surface force.
The force of the surface, derived from the attraction between water molecules on the surface, is more attractive than they are between above and above air molecules.
Water molecules form a surface that is not visible on the surface of the water so that things such as needles can float on the surface of the water.
There are two blades between the modern iced shoes, and there is a pit between the blades. Double-grained sliding shoes can also be more solid to catch the ice surface even when it’s bending.
Because the bottom of the knife is slightly curved, when the knife turns to one side of it, it also bends on the side of the ice.
This enables the ice-shoes to turn around. If the ice-shoes are turned right, the ice-shoe will turn right, if the ice-shoes are turned left, then the ice-shoe will turn left.
To return to the original energy level, the atoms must remove the extra energy obtained from the light.
They do this by launching tiny photons called photons.
Scientists call this process \"stirred radiation\" because the atoms are under strong light stimulation, leading to lighting in the light, while light is one of the radiation.
The next picture shows atomic radiation. Of course, in reality, the photo is much smaller than what it sees in this picture.
The photons are even smaller than the materials that form the atoms!
After hundreds of hours of use, the lamp in the bulb will eventually burn, allowing the bulb to be no longer used.
And then the bulb needs to be replaced. Be careful when changing the bulb.
First of all, you need to close the lighting circuit or cut the cable connection.
This is because if you touch some of the metal bottom of the socket inside the socket or light bulb still contact the socket, the current that flows into the socket (i.e., the location of the light bulb metal section) can make you very powerful.

Some scientists believe that dragons eat iron, which is a common plant.
These plants seem to be a small palm tree, with a scaffolding scaffold.
The Dragons may use their strong scaffolding leaves before eating a tree.
Other scientists argue that these plants contain dramatic poisons, so it’s unlikely that any dinosaurs will eat them, but other animals such as today’s balm and saliva (the offspring of the dinosaurs) can also eat toxic leaves or fruits.
How will the earth’s gravitational force pull me? If you stand on the surface of the wood, it will be less heavy than the weight of the Earth’s surface.
One person weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth and weighs 36 pounds (16 kg) on wood. Obviously, the land of wood is smaller.
The sun doesn’t have a Earth-like shell that allows you to stand above it. The whole sun is made up of gases, fires and lightnings.
As far away from the center of the sun, the gas becomes thiner.
The outer part we see when we watch the sun is called the “lightball layer”.
About three thousand years later, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei observed Venus as a failure in 1610.
Venus (or the moon) is only lighted on the side of the sun, so there is a loss. Venus's profit proves that Gothni has proposed the theory of a planet’s rotation around the Sun.
Then, years later, in 1639, British astronomer Jeremiah Horox observed Venus Day.

However, because the Navy is concerned that ships will be attacked by German air, only a few Royal Navy ships are standing near a larger route of invasion.
Let’s start with explaining Italian plans. Italy is mostly German and Japanese “brothers”.
Even if they had just built four new ships before the war started, its military and naval forces were still weak.

Japan, like Britain, is an island country.
The submarine is a boat designed for a long time to navigate and stay under the water.
The submarines were used during World War I and World War II. At the time they were very slow, and the range was very limited.
In the early days of the war, most of them spent their time navigation on the sea, but with radar development becoming more accurate, submerged ships were forced to navigate under the water, avoiding being found.
German submarines are known as U-boats. Germans are very good at navigation and operation of long submarines.
Because they were so successful in submarines, Germany was not trusted to have many submarines after the war.

Another well-known Greek is mathematician Petagoras, the most famous of whom is theorem about the dominance of the angle.
The number of people who live in Indian languages is estimated to be different. The Indian language is estimated to be the second to fourth language used by the world’s largest.
The number of people in native language is different depending on whether or not they are very close to the language.
It is estimated that there are 340 million to 500 million language users, and up to 800 million people can understand the language.
In everyday conversations, users of both languages can generally understand each other.

Learn to create interactive media calls for regular and traditional skills, as well as tools available in interactive classroomes (Series Boards, Audio and Video Editors, Stories, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to re-estimate the assumptions about media production and learn to think in a nonlinear way.
Interactive design requires that each component of the project be connected to each other, but can also be a single entity.
In order to reach a certain focal point, compared with the focus mirror, the drawback of the lens is that the complexity of the focus and the higher requirements for the number of elements of the mirror.
This is becoming more and more difficult, as mirror manufacturers have been able to produce a higher level of lenses.
This allows the lenses to take pictures of the quality of the mirror.
Another drawback of the lens is that the maximum photon (speed) of the lens is usually lower.
This makes it difficult to use cheap lenses in a low-light environment without a flashlight.
When trying to convert a movie into a DVD format, one of the most common problems is overscan.
Most of the TV shows were produced for the public.
Therefore, all the shows you see on TV, the top, the bottom and the border on the side are cut off.
This is to make sure the image covers the whole screen. This means overscan.
Unfortunately, when you create a DVD, its boundary is likely to be cut off, and if the video’s subtitle is too close to the bottom, they won’t show it completely.
The traditional medieval castles always inspire imagination, fight, and the sight of a party with King Arthur is in front of the eyes.
Even in the waste of thousands of years of history, it still smells the smell of war, hear the turrets on the lyre, feel the fear sent in the prison.
Is our imagination based only on reality? Why is the castle created at the beginning? How are they designed and built?
At the time, the Castle of Muslu was actually more like a strong house than a real castle.
Its large glass windows and thin walls are unable to resist lasting attacks.
In the 1480s, the castle was built by Lord Hastings, when the nation was relatively peaceful, only to defend against the rape of the thief.

Cells are the basic units of all organisms, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
Cells are the foundation and key of life, and in fact, they are often referred to as “the cornerstone of life.”
The nervous system sustains the body’s balance by sending neural mutations in the body, allowing blood to continue to flow unstoppablely.
These neural shocks can be quickly transmitted across the body to help protect the body from any potential threat.
Compared with other strong storms, the tornado is smaller, but they can destroy everything in their path.
The tornado lifts the tree, pulls off the ceiling on the building and rolls the car onto the sky. Two percent of the strong dragon’s wind can last for more than three hours.
These giant storms have up to 480 km/h (33 m/s; 300 miles/h).
For thousands of years, humans have been making and using lenses for amplification.

The earth is filled with animals, they have holes in the earth, some of them swim in the ocean, some of them in the sky.
Cells are the most basic structures and functional units of biological life.
The word cell comes from the Latin word cella, meaning the small room.
If you look at living under a microscope, you will find that they are made up of many small squares or balls.
English biologist Robert Hucker observed a small square structure of a soft wood under a microscope.
They look like a room. He's the first person to observe dead cells.
Elements and compounds can be converted from one state to another and remain unchanged.
Although nitrogen is gas, it still has the same characteristics as liquid nitrogen. While liquid states are higher density, but molecules are the same.
Water is another example composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, belonging to compounds.
Whether the gas, liquid or solid, the molecular structure is the same.
Although its physical state or its state will change, the chemical state will not.
Time has been around us and affects everything we do, but it’s hard to understand.
Religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars have studied time for thousands of years.
We're in a series of futures, now to the past events, to feel the time gone.
Time is also the way we compare the length (long) of our activities.
You can repeat events by observing the repeated events of the weekly period from time to time. The weekly event refers to what happens regularly.
Today’s computer is used to handle images and videos.
Computers can create complex animations that are increasingly common in television and movies.

For a very long time between the 19th and 20th centuries, it was widely believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Mauris, who lived by hunting a giant bird known as a fear bird.
The theory has also established a concept that the Mauris took a large fleet of crews from Bosnia and Herzegovina to take over New Zealand from the Moriorians and develop a agricultural society.
But there is new evidence that the Morioris were actually a group of people who moved from New Zealand to the island of Chatham and then developed their own unique culture of peace.
There are also other tribes on Chatham Island, who are Mauri emigrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves Moriolis, after a small conflict, the Moriors were finally destroyed.
People who have been involved over the past decades have helped us appreciate our own strengths and passions, while at the same time considering difficulties or even failure.

When assessing success and realizeing failure, individuals and all-in-one participants will discover more deep values, mission and dynamics of the agency.
In this case, looking back on past corporate behavior and leading its successful practice can help people accept new changes in local churches and move forward in a new direction.
This success story reduces people’s fear of change, while making people more willing to accept future changes.
A polynomial thinking model is a difficult solution to collect different ideas and patterns and find solutions.
The focus of this mind is on speed, logic and accuracy, and there is also a fact-aware, reusing existing techniques and collecting data.
The most important factor in this mind is that there is only one correct answer. You’ll only think of two answers, that’s right or wrong.
This way of thinking is linked to some scientific or standard procedures.
People who think in this way have logical thinking, able to remember the ranking mode, solve problems and conduct scientific tests.
Human beings are the most able to understand other similar ideas today.
This means that we can successfully predict the perception, intent, belief, cognitive or hunger of others.
Understanding other people’s intentions is particularly important in these abilities. It enables us to better identify the differences that arise from the body’s actions.
For example, if you see someone breaking the window, you have a great chance to assume he's trying to steal someone else's car.
If he loses his car keys and tries to break the window, he needs a different judgment.
Magnetic resonance was based on a physical phenomenon called NMR, discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Persel (from Harvard University).
In this resonance, magnetic fields and wireless waves give the atom a weak wireless signal.
In 1970, Dr. Raymond Damadian found the basis for using magnetic resonance images as a medical diagnostic tool.
It was granted a patent after four years, the world’s first patent for magnetic resonance.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first, full body and magnetic resonance scanner, which he called \"100 percent.\"
Non-synchronous communication provides time to reflect and respond to others.
This allows students to learn at their own pace and to control the rhythm of the indicator information.
In addition, the number of flexible working hours reduces the time limit. (Bremer, 1998)
Using the Internet and the World Wide Web can allow learners to get information at any time.
Students can also ask their teachers questions at any time of the day and are expected to get a quick response without having to wait until the next class.
After modernism, the way to learn about modernism provides absolute freedom.
In fact, there is no single good thing to learn. The interactive experience of learners with the knowledge shown is the learning process.
All the self-experience we have now, as well as the learning television show that presents information, just tell us this.
Many people will find themselves watching a TV show, and the process and experience it shows is the knowledge we will never participate in or apply.
We will never renovate the car, build a fountain in the back of the house, go to the ancient sites or change the neighbor’s house.
