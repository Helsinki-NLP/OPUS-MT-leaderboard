Parliamentary Parliament of Wales is worried about ‘Looking up as if it were a sign.’
Some lawmakers are surprised by the proposal that they call it MWPs (Wals Council) to be changed.
This is because the name of the Parliament is to be changed to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of various political parties are worried that they may be making fun of each other.
One member of the Labour Party said his organization was worried about “that’s how much Pwp is with Twp.”
For readers outside Wales reference: Twp means stupid, pwp means foolish.
A Welsh member of Parliament said the organization was \"unhappily\" and proposed an alternative.
A Welsh conservative said his organization had \"openness\" for change, but pointed out that from MWP to Ringo occasionally had only a short way in its mouth.
In this case, the WW speech is similar to that of York County U.S.U.
The Parliamentary Committee is currently drafting legislation to introduce a name change, which states: \"The final decision on any description of the names of the members of the Parliament is, of course, determined by the members themselves.\"
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gives the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee announced a public consultation on the proposal and found general support for the Parliament as the Welsh Parliament.
On the question of the nickname of the House of Commons, the Committee tends to Congress of Wales or WMPs, but MWP receives the most support in public consultations.
It is clear that the House of Commons has recommended that it be adopted, but that it is difficult to achieve a common sense of well-being that the President of the Parliament, Eline Jones, has a headache, and that he expects to submit a draft legislation on the change within weeks.
The legislation on reform will include changes in the methods of work of the Parliament, including the rules on de-defectation of the membership of the Parliament and the design of the Commission system.
During the argumental legislative process, members of Parliament will finalise the question they should call for.
Macedonians hold a referendum on changing national names
The electorate will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change the name of the country to the North Macedonia Republic.
A referendum has been established to resolve the disputes of Greece with its neighbours for decades, and the Greek province is named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighboring country represents its territory and repeatedly opposes its accession to the European Union and the North East.
Macedonian President Gölgaivanov said he would not vote.
However, supporters of the general referendum within the Prime Minister Zorlan Ev believe that the change is only a price for joining the European Union and the North Testament.
St Martin's Church's voice was silenced in the Halling block.
Adams says: \"In history, there is a bar and a church in each corner that I have talked to.\"
“The house, both of them, has nothing to do with it.”
She said the missing bar is understandable.
He said: \"The way the family is social is different.\"
\"The bar does not contain a community room where people often visit.
As for the church, she was concerned that the money sold wouldn't continue as long as the leaders expected,\" and that they would soon return to where they had begun.
She added that the church may be replaced by an apartment building, and that the apartment is filled with those who do not wish to help the rest of the neighborhood.
\"Most people who buy apartments in these buildings are white,\" he said, \"and therefore, these churches will close very quickly because most of those who move into the apartment are not likely to be members of these churches.
Both churches were built in 1870 by whites before becoming black metropolis-majority communities, while St. Martin's Cathedral ten years later.
The first white council meeting was moved out in the 1930s.
A black conference which has been doing her work around a week has acquired ownership of the building.
The Black Church of St. Martin, led by Rev. John Howard Jackson, led a campaign to resist the 125th Street retailer, a major shopping street in Harling, which refused to hire or promote black people.
A large fire in 1939 destroyed the building, but when Father Jenson's parish residents set up a reconstruction plan, they commissioned the fire to produce the clock.
Rev. David Jackson, the successor of St. Martin's Cathedral, is proud to call this clock the \"Hell of the Poor\".
In July, experts at the clock called it \"Cultural Tales\" and \"The irreplaceable Historical Instruments\".
The Tiffany Ng expert at the University of Michigan noted that this was the first clock in the world played by Black Musicist Dionisio A. Linde 18 years ago when he moved to the govt church.
Mr. Merriweser said that the Church of St. Martin did not replace him.
Over the past few months, St. Martin's Church has performed a complex story about architects and contractors, some of which are brought by the church's non-religious leaders, some from the parish.
The parish committee, composed of non-religious leaders - wrote in July to the parish, was concerned that the church would set up a method to transfer fees to the parish council, although the parish committee did not participate in the construction of buildings and contractors that were sent to the parish.
Some of the teachers complained about the lack of transparency in the church.
The 13-year-old boy in California was bited by sharks when he was diving.
Officially, on Saturday, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark while scuba diving on the open day of the Dragon Season in California.
The attack took place at 7 a.m. near Becken Beach in Nsinitas.
Chathamer spoke to the KSWB TV station in San Diego about Saturday morning when he and his friends were diving around half an hour while he heard the boy call out for help, and then took a boat with a group of people to help pull them out of the water.
Romer said that he thought that he was just a fan of the dragon, but then he realized that he was shouting, 'I was bited!
I'm hurt!'
Its entire lock was torn apart,\" said Hamer, who noticed it to the boy.
“I’m going to ask everyone to leave the water: ‘There are sharks in the water!’” said Hamer.
The boy was sent to the Red Child Hospital in San Diego, where he was listed as being in a state of emergency.
The species of sharks that cause this attack are unknown.
Life-saving team captain La Rijars said a fish was found in the region a few weeks ago, but determined that it was not a dangerous species of sharks.
Jairs added that the victim was injured in the first half.
For investigation and security purposes, it has closed 48 hours' access from Ponto Beach in Casabland to Svamy Beach in Esinitas.
Jaels points out that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Seansbury plans to enter the British beauty market.
Cairnsbury is competing with Boutique, Super Drugs and Debenham to open 100 store-style beauty channels and equipped with professional assistants.
As a part of the British $28 million beauty market, the market continues to grow while fashion and family goods sales continue to grow, and larger beauty racks will be tested in 11 stores across the country if the proof is successful, next year it will be held in more stores.
In investing in beauty, supermarkets are looking for ways to use furniture spaces for TV, microwaves and home appliances that were once charged.
Seansbury says it will double the size of its beauty products, reaching 3000 species, including brands like Luwau, Esey, Dissieman, and Dr. Mutsu.
The existing series of products, such as Eurea, Breeze and Bee, will also get more space, whose brand area is similar to that of brands in shops like Boeing.
Supermarkets will relaunch the collection of cosmetics that make most of the products belongs to a vegetarian friendly type - this is one of the increasing demand for young shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer Finhan stores will try to operate on two stores in Seensberg, where the first store opened last week in Creek in south London, and the second opened in the second half of Birmingham in the second half of this year.
Changes in online shopping and the daily purchase of small amounts of food at local convenience stores mean that supermarkets must do more work to persuade people to visit.
Seansbury CEO Mike Cooper said that as the supermarket attempts to counter discounters Aldi and Lidre with more services and non-food, these stores will become more and more like 100 stores.
Since its acquisition of these two chains two years ago, the company has set up the Agos Olettes market in hundreds of stores and introduced some of its properties, which says it has promoted the sale of grocery stores to make the purchase more profitable.
This supermarket previously attempted to transform beauty and pharmacy to fail.
At the beginning of the 21st century, Cairnsberg attempted to establish a joint venture with Bosch, but a dispute arose on how to allocate revenue from the supermarket's stock shop, and cooperation between the two parties thus ended.
Three years ago, Cairnsbury sold its 281 stores' pharmacy business at a price of £125 million, a home chain owned by Selezio.
Lloyd will play a role in the project, adding a series of luxury-care brands at four stores, including La Creek's.
Paul Mills-Hix, Business Director at Cairnsbury, said: \"We have changed the appearance and feel of the beauty channel to improve the environment of our customers.
We also hired trained colleagues to provide advice at any time.
Our brand series is designed to meet a wide variety of needs, inducers' environment and convenient location and to challenge old shopping styles while our home is a noticeable and beautiful destination.
Peter Jones exits the deal of £11 million on Holly Willoby 'Greet'
After TV show host Holly Willoby withdraws from his lifestyle brand business £11 million, focusing on a new contract with Martha's goods and standalone TV, Dragon Cemetery star Peter Jones 'Anger'
Willoby has no concern and their home uniforms brand Truly.
The two businesses were once compared to the Cupé of Gwinnis Patlow.
The 37-year-old morning column host announced on Instagram that he would leave.
Holly Willowby exits their profitable lifestyle brand business at the last minute with a focus on new insurance contracts with Martha's goods and standalone TV, allowing the dragon cave star Peter Jones to collide.
It was reported that at a press conference held on Tuesday at Marriott's Business Empire headquarters in Platinum County, Pennsylvania, the TV industry's acclaimed actress admitted that her new contract was worth up to £1.5 million - meaning she would not have invested enough time in their home clothing and decoration brand Truly, and Jones was very angry with it.
This business is compared to the Cupé of Gwinnis Patlow and is considered to have doubled the wealth of around £11 million in Willoby.
When Willoby, 37, announced on Instagram that he would leave Truly, Jones left the United Kingdom by plane and went to his vacation home.
\"To date, the primary priorities of the Trolley family are:
This will lead to its long-term future, and can be seen as it will evolve in the coming decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday is so close to going on.
There's a warehouse in Malo's headquarters that contains goods that are ready to be sold.
Experts believe that as one of the UK's most valuable stars, the departure of column hosts this morning may lead to the loss of millions of companies because the company's investment in products such as sitting down and sewing to clothing and home clothing is very large and may be further delayed.
And that might mean the end of a long-term friendship.
The three little children's mother, Willoby, and husband Danbodwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Taracap.
Willoby founded the Trolley Company with Cap in 2016 and joined Jones as chairman in March.
Here is a 40 percent stake in this couple's holiday, where Jones owns a TV production company in Baldwin.
Willoby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPalin as the host of an independent TV station.
A news source near Jones said last night that \"we won't comment on its business.\"
I'd like to talk to you, 'And then I'm in love.'
She joked that since she had published comments from some people as \"non-President\", as well as the attitude of the leader of South Korea, she would be criticized by the media.
Did President Trump give up so much?
Trump uses a voice in his simulation of \"News Broadcasting\".
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting held in June after the first meeting in Singapore, and said that Trump commended South Korea for its step towards denuclearization.
But there's a deadlock in denuclearization.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, South Korea's highest diplomat, Li Yong Ho, spoke to world leaders at the United Nations Congress on Saturday, and did not want to accept any form of debate. The UN General Assembly said Saturday that North Korea did not see the United States response to early United States disarmament operations in North Korea.
Instead, she pointed out that the United States is continuing to impose sanctions to keep pressure.
Trump has taken a more positive view of his talk.
\"We're doing well on the Korean issue,\" he said.
\"We're going to fight in North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
And my relationship with you is very good.”
He said that he made positive results in improving his relationship with Kim Chen-in's, ending rocket trials, helping release humanity, and returning the remains of the U.S. Army to the United States.
He also defended his own approach to matters relating to Kim-in's relationship.
\"It's too easy to be president, but it's not that 10,000 people are trying to get outside and that's where about 200 people are standing,\" said Trump.
Indonesia sea level and earthquake destroyed an island and caused hundreds of deaths.
For example, after an earthquake on the Long Island, foreign non-governmental organizations were told not to need them.
Despite over 10 per cent of the population of Long Island, no national disasters have been declared, which is a premier condition for promoting international assistance.
\"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so they have some challenges.\"
Although helping children is building a team to go to Palu, she has not yet been sure if foreign authorities can work locally.
Mr. Sudopo, National Disaster Agency spokeswoman, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Peru to determine whether international agencies are allowing it to contribute to the assistance process.
Despite ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country's anger against nature remains unprepared.
Although they were built in Aceh, they were not common on other coasts.
Despite the entry into force of the International Maritime Organization, it is clear that Palu has no seams, and that is likely to be one of the reasons for the loss of life.
Traveling between many islands in Indonesia is a challenge at the best.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A medical vessel in the treatment of the earthquake was heading to Palu, but it took him at least three days to get to a new disaster scene.
President Zocovido will improve Indonesia's infrastructure for infrastructure for damage as a core component of his campaign, where he invests considerable funds on roads and railways.
However, the funding shortages have been disrupting Mr. Zoco's government and will face another re-election next year.
Mr. Zoco is also under pressure from religious tensions that Indonesia is not going to make, and most Muslim members of that country have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
As a result of the use of knife in the streets by Christian and Muslim groups, archers and other rough weapons have fought, more than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes.

The Clenwill statue of the Parliament became the most recent memorial event of \"reforming history\"
For those who believe in his Taliban, the destruction of many British culture and religious art, the expulsion of more symbolic meanings.
However, the Clernwell Association described Mr. Rick's proposal as \"stupid\" and \"inspired to change history.\"
John Gold Smith, Chairman of the Clenwill Association, noted that \"the remove of the Olyvrell statue outside Westminster as a target is inevitable in today's discussion.\"
The worship of the Saints in the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out.
Or the wrong Clunwill will be sacrificed because of what his first-century Zotomas did in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Sonicrovt’s great description of Kronwell’s 19th century has proved to be part of the history of many people who are considered to be worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith wrote to Sunday: “Many people, in particular at the end of the 19th century, thought that the Clenwell Parliament had a guard to resist external stress, of course, the monarchy of his time.”
This is a complete and accurate statement that remains on the subject discussed in history.
It can be determined that the 17th century conflict resulted in the development of our country after the Day, and Clenwell was the representative of the other party to which he was considered to be a conflict.
Its achievements as a guardian also deserve our honor and remembrance.”
A Chinese farmer was killed by a pig.
According to local media reports, farmers in a southwestern China region are bited by a pig in the market.
According to the South China Morning Sunday newspaper, the man's name \"Yun\" was found to have been found in the 6-story water market in Fuzhou Province, where he died in a severe collapse.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farm in Xinning, Qinghai province of China was preparing for a pig injection in the pig field.
He had intended to go out from the isolated province of Linan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found his body and found that the door of the pig's house next to him was opened.
According to him, there's blood in the pig's mouth.
According to the report, the FDA confirmed that the 550 pounds of public pigs had been bited into the pig farm.
\"The evening of the Assassin's report refers to the dead man's cousin Yuyuan, who said, \"My cousin's feet are bited into blood meat.\"
Watch videos showing that Yun was in the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
About an hour later his body was discovered.
The pig who bites the man’s name does not belong to one or his brother.
Market administrators told the late news that the big pig had been stopped to prevent it from attacking others, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
A family and a market manager said they were talking about the death of one of them.
Even though there were few, there was a record of a pig's attack on the human family.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband in the farm and caused serious injuries to her husband.
10 years ago, a 650-pound pig pressed a Welsh farmer on the ground until the farmer's wife was scared of the pig.
After the time a farmer in Oregon was eaten by a pig in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba and the CBC News said pig typically did not perform an attack, but the smell of blood led to a change in the situation.
\"They just want to play.
They are only pigs, curious pigs... they don't want to hurt people.
You just need to show them proper respect,\" she said.
The rest of the storms bring widespread rain to the southwestern United States of America.
As predicted, the wind is gradually shrinking as the colder waters move to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the next time the rains will continue to bring heavy rains to northern and south-west Mexico.
As of 5 a.m., the winds reached 85 miles per hour. East Time Sunday, and located 385 miles south-west of Punta Ugginia, Mexico.
Predicting Sundays will move north.
At the same time, a low-pressure slot over the Pacific is being formed and is heading east to the west coast of the United States. A hot storm near the California Islands will bring deep hot water to the southwestern United States.
Monday morning will bring rains of up to 10 inch in Mexico’s local areas.
Next, due to the impact of hot water and near low wind interactions, there will be a wide rainfall in the southwestern region.
1 to 4 inch rains in the local area will cause a flood of mountains, as well as mud streams and mountain slidings.
Hot water vapor will cause rainfall in some areas to reach 2-3 inches per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwestern region, especially Arizona, the rainfall is up to 2-4 inches.
An explosive flood is extremely likely to occur as a result of the dispersal nature of the hot rains.
Heat with rain conditions strongly recommend not to risk walking to the desert.
The heavy rains will cause the valley to become a flood river bed, while the thunderstorm will bring local winds and dust.
A low-gas condensation that is about to land will bring strong rain to local areas along the Southern California Coast.
The total rainfall may reach half inch, leading to small silt flows and humiding roads.
This rainfall will be the first rainfall in the region.
A few zero-star heat- bringer will reach Arizona on Sunday night and Sunday, and a wider rainfall will be on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains will be covered on Tuesdays and next Wednesdays.
In the United States, with the cooling of the Arctic in October, there have been major changes in temperatures across the United States, but the hot zone remains relatively warm.
A sharp change in short-term temperature is sometimes caused by severe changes in temperature.
An obvious example of this is the strong temperature difference experienced in the middle of the United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebrasca, and St. Louis, and Mounes, Iowa, it is close to 20 degrees.
In the next few days, it will come back to a larger range of summer heat.
It is expected that most parts of the Middle East will be warmed in October, covering 80% of the southern plains to the north-east.
New York City temperature up to 80°C on Tuesday, up to 10°C above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that in the first half of October, the temperature in the United States will be higher than the average.
Over 20,000 people have seen Bretcanova's hearing
More than 20 million people on the six television channel looked at the testimony of Black Carnova, a Supreme Court nominee, and women who accused him of sexual assault.
At the same time, there is a political deadlock, and the TV interrupted the last minute of the regular show on Friday: an investigation of the charge by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which was drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Fleek.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that she was 100% sure that Kanova had been drunk at a high school team and tried to get rid of her shirt.
Carnova said in his warm testimony that he had not happened.
According to Nelson, it's about 20.4 million people.
The company statistics the average value of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data, including PBS, C-SAPN, and Fox business spells, failed to statistics immediately.
Usually, Nelson will not be able to figure out the crowd watching in his office.
From a certain point of view, the number of this audience is probably similar to that of the football season or the Oscar audience.
Nelson said 569 million people at the hearing all day saw the discussion host of Fox News Channel strongly backed Kanova’s identification.
ABC received the second for 32.6 million viewers.
NELSON said it had 3.1 million CBS, NBC was 294 million, MSNBC was 289 million, and CNN was 252 million.
After the audience, the audience was still very interested.
Flek is the central character of Friday's drama.
After a statement by the Republican Party office said he would vote for Kawano, on Friday morning he was haired by CNN and CBS’s camera, and when he tried to take the elevator to the judicial committee for hearing, the protestor shouted at him.
CNN lives for a few minutes because he's been deplored.
\"I'm standing in front of you,\" said a woman.
“Do you think he will tell the truth to the people of the country?”
He said, “You have power, but many women don’t.”
Fleak said his office had issued a statement that he would talk more at the committee hearing before the elevator closed.
A few hours after the live streaming of online television and radio networks, the judicial committee voted for Kawano’s nomination to vote in advance of the Senate’s entire vote.
But Frank said he did this just because he understood that the FBI would investigate allegations of nominees next week, but a few Democrats have been urging to do so.
Fleak and his friend Democratic Senator Chris Courens were persuaded to speak to him.
After talking to Coin and several senators, Flek made a decision.
Flek is the right to choose because it’s obvious that if there is no investigation, Republicans won’t vote for Kavano.
President Trump has authorized the FBI to investigate Kawano’s allegations.
British Prime Minister May criticized critics for his comments on Brexit’s “Toying Politics”
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Texa May criticized her plan to leave the European Union for saying \"to play politics\" undermines Britain's future national interests.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrived in Birmingham on September 29, 2018 to attend the Conservative meeting.
In an interview with her on another front page, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called Chex Brexit program, saying that Britain and the European Union should impose tariffs on each other, completely ridiculous.

Mexico City volcano sprayed out of the fire.
The volcanic ashes from the Bocaterpiler volcano have reached the southern community of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday that after the volcano activity, do not approach the volcano, the volcano has recorded more than 24 hours of more than 183 gas and volcanic dust emissions.
The center is monitoring the sound and shocks several times.

On Saturday, thousands of people from Barcelona participated in a protest against Catalonia's independence for a week, with six pro-independent protesters fighting against the police.
A series of cover-up dividers were trapped by violent police who threw eggs and powder into the violent police and burned up smoking on the streets of the streets filled with tourists.

\"We've been through the best of our lives in the past.\"
I saw my parents crying because they could hold a referendum, but we were trapped.”
Despite the fact that in December old December was a key victory in the regional elections, Catalonia's support for independent political parties today is also working to maintain this trend, although many prominent leaders are either exile or are awaiting a hearing due to the organization's referendum and the proclamation of independence.
A 42-year-old electric worker recorded protests supporting the police with his mobile phone and claimed that the conflict was caused by two politicians.
“The situation is getting worse,” he said.
Olylpun Kras, one of the nine leaders in the pre-trial prison in Catalonia, announced on Saturday that he would participate in the elections next year.
\"A candidate for European elections is one of the best ways to criticize democratic values and the Spanish government we see,\" he said.
Derry, London: A man who was arrested after a car crash
Three years after the crash of a house in Delhi in London, men who were 33,34,39 were arrested.
The event occurred on Thursday at 19:30 p.m. in Balinagad.
The incident caused damage to the door of the house and to the body.
A flicker was also found on the car.
Monga's goal is to make Livingston a 1-0 team.
Dolly Monga's first goal is to make sure Davidston wins.
Ben Malivenston was shocked by the wanderer team as a coach at the Ibrox Club, the second time Steven Gerald lost interest in 18 games.
Dolly Monga's goal proves this difference, Gary Holt's team name moved to Hebernian and second.
Gerald's team still won this season's Super League, and next Sunday they'll face their 8-point leader's team.
Prior to that, the Wanderers team will be on Thursday's European Terrace home against the rapid delivery of the team.
At the same time, Livingston will expand its stand to six, and since replacing Kennedy Miller last month, chief coach Holt is still in defeat.
Livingston missed the chance of a warless guest.
Holt's team's straight way into a wide variety of problems for the wanderers, and they should have led a lot ahead of the goal.
Scott Robinson tried to take the ball through, but over the ball door, and then Alan Risco had to try to shoot it down, Craig Harkt took the ball and passed the ball door.
The team knew that they were able to make trouble for the crew on the ball, and that they would be able to attack by the wanderers in front of them.
That's the key way to play.
The Wrathers sent Livington an arbitrary ball, Livingston made empty files, Declan Garah and Robinson together to pass the ball to Monga, and the latter played in the zone.
At that time, the wanderers held the right to the ball, but found that the main team had a strong defense against the wind, and that the gate was almost unsurpassed by Liam Corey.
Despite the fact that Alfred Morelos forced Corley to make a rescue, the model continued to be in the second half.
Wanderers lined Aaron McGreg to stop Scott Pittman with their feet, and Risgo was at another position in Livingston.
Livingston’s ban is always in the middle of the ball, and it’s still broken, while two points, Harkert, blames the team’s supporter, Grace Midlton and the handball.
\"Excellent\" Livingston Analytics
Alasdale Lamont, a BBC company in Scotland, at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Livingston won with extraordinary performance.
For someone, they are excellent, and they continue to have an unexpected performance on this rising track.
Since his return to the top event, their game styles and people have almost changed, but this is due to Holt, because he’s inspired the team after his arrival.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Harkert's ability supergroup, organized wells with a line of defense, and Monga lets Conna Goldson and Joe Warlar stay alert to him at the very beginning.
However, the mob lacks inspiration.
Under Gerald’s leadership, they sometimes perform well, but they’re not far from those standards.
They lack one foot. They only tear the main team door once. This is a little like a watch for the mid-travel wanderers.
Erdogan's reaction in Cologne is not in vain.
Saturday (29 September), the weather is clear, Turkish and German leaders smile full and have breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day President Erdogan visited Germany - with the aim of repairing relations between the North American Union.
The issues they argue about include human rights, freedom of news and Turkish membership in the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to reveal a whole new major mosque.
The city is the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25000 people from gathered before the mosque, but as a result, many supporters met their president nearby.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurdishs, also expressed their hearts, who condemned Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to welcome his visit.
The two sides’ struggles reflect their differences with visitors, some German Turkishs praised him as heroes, and others condemned him as dictators.

The road is closed, the bus is changed, and the car driver is advised to avoid this area.
Chief Lati Prison: Six police officers were injured in the improbable.
Police officers said six prison officers had been injured in the impeachment of a hard-hit man.
On Sunday, at 9:30 p.m., HMP governor Lati prison in Uster County was devastated and was continuing.
The “Dronal Wind” expert was involved in dealing with the chaos, and eight prisoners involved were detained in the side room.
These faces were treated in the face of the ill-treated police officer.
The prison service agency spokeswoman said: “The prison court that has been trained has dealt with the ongoing HMP Chief Lati prison incident.”
Six injured police officers have been treated.
We hate violence, and we all know that those responsible for it will be transferred to the police, and they may spend more time in prison.”
HMP Chief Lati jailed more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
It is reported that in June the jailer was treated by a prisoner after an attack.
Last October, the anti-bacterial police were arranged to be held in prison to deal with the serious riots, where the police were attacked by the ball.
Windstorms cause a mountain flood, threatens Phoenix City, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, which can benefit from dry areas.
Although the heat with low air pressure attacks are rare in Arizona, it could just happen early next week, as the storm’s residue of energy through the Southwest desert will pose a risk of a storm.
The National Weather Service has issued weather alerts of a fire on Monday and Tuesday, from the western state of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, south-east of California and Utah, including Phoenix City, flag town, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that the storm will pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and there will be rains later on Monday.
The National Weather Agency in Phoenix noted that “Since 1950, within 200 miles of Phoenix, only 10 hot-tempered winds have remained hot with storm or low air pressure!”
Wind Cartina (1967) within 40 miles along the AZ border.
The latest model of the National Wind Center is expected to have two to four inches of rainfall, and only six inches will reach the Mogolon edge of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southern Desert, including the central and large basins of the Lollen Mountains, may have 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, and the total rainfall in other regions may reach 4 inches.
For areas other than the risk of floods in the mountains, the rain of the storm may be a pleasure because these areas are suffering from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some rainfall will likely benefit from the current dry environment in the southwestern part of the country.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring center, more than 40% of Arizona’s regions are at least extremely dry, which is the second highest level,” reports weather.com.
First of all, the path of the storm passes through the Mexican Peninsula, landing in California.
The storm is still in the wind on Sunday morning, the largest wind is 85 miles per hour, 385 miles south of Mexico, and moving to the north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm found colder seawater in the Pacific, and thus reduced.
Therefore, it is expected that it will land in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the intensity of the storm.
Rainfalls in some parts of Mexico can be very large, causing serious flooding.
“The total rainfall in the northwestern part of Sonola, California, is expected to reach 3 to 6 inches, with a maximum of 10 inches,” reports weather.com.
The storm will cross north in the form of a hot storm, and then on Tuesday morning, it will reach the border of Arizona in the form of hot low-pressure pressure, then up through Arizona, and enter southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The main danger of predicting the storm or the residue of the storm is the storm in the northwestern Sonola and the southwestern desert in the United States,” the National Storm Center said.
Forecasts of these rains will trigger a flood of life-threatening mountains, desert sludges, and mountain slopes.
Medsaminoton Attack: Four Killers
After a 16-year-old boy was found injured in Sammersett, three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for alleged murder.
On Saturday, about four o'clock in the summer of the United Kingdom, a young man was found in the Excelsiotlers area of Midsamernoton.
He was taken to the hospital and is currently “stable.”

Trump said Kawano was “infuriated” by the Democrats and “infrequently angry.”
Trump said at a conference in Wellington, West Virginia, that \"The vote to Judge Kawano is a strategy to reject the Democrats' insatiable and arrogant\".
Trump said Kawano was \"slow\" and \"greed\" by the Democrats during the nomination process.
Cavano testified on Tuesday before the parliament, strongly and excitedly denied that Christin Bryce Ford accused him more than a decade ago, when they were still teenagers of sexual assault.
Ford was also in the hearing to testify to her charges.
On Saturday, the president said, “The American people saw Kawano’s talent, virtue, and courage that day.”
He said to a group of supporters in West Virginia, “The vote to judge Kawano is one of the most successful legal talent in our time, a judge with a record of high-level public service.”
The President spoke about the importance of Republican voters in the mid-term elections, with a sharp reference to Kavano’s nomination.
“There are five weeks of important elections away from our lives.
I didn't compete, but I'm really in the race,\" he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for the great candidate everywhere.”
Trump believes that the Democratic Party’s mission is “to resist and prevent.”
A Republican senior leadership assistant informs the U.S. online news network that Senate will hold the first key programme vote for Kawano’s nomination not later than Friday.
Indonesia earthquake and seafalls killed hundreds of people, and the number of deaths is still rising.
On Saturday, Officially, Indonesia's Surahvisi island was hit by a large earthquake and a seafall, a massive wave hit the beach, and a stand-up, killing at least 384 people.
On Friday evening, hundreds of people celebrate on the beach in Palou, at 6 m high (18 ft) on the shore of a massive storm, swept many dead and destroyed everything that came to them.
After the 7.5 earthquake.
“At the time of the threat of the seagull yesterday, a lot of people were still operating on the beach without immediate flight and becoming victims,” said Sutobo Pvo Nugroho, spokeswoman for BNPB, Indonesia’s national disaster relief agency.
Nugroho said, “The seaside is not just its own coming, but it drags cars, wood, house, everything on the ground,” and, before the attack on the coast, the seagull crossed the open sea at an hour of 800 kilometers (497 miles) per hour.
He said some of them survived to the trees to escape the sea.
About 1,600 people were expelled to 24 centres in Palu.
A photo of the aircraft released by disaster relief agencies shows that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, the bridge is deformed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday's day, the earthquake continues to rock the coastal city.
24 million people live in this series of earthquakes.
Indonesia’s Evaluation and Technical Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the power released on Friday’s five-day earthquake was about 200 times the number of World War II launch atomic bombs in Guangzhou City.
It said the city is located at the end of the long and narrow bay, and such a geographical location may extend the size of the seamount.
Nugroho used “great” loss and also said thousands of houses, hospitals, stores and hotels fell.
He said that the bodies of some of the trapped victims were found under the stones of the broken building, 540 wounded, 29 missing.
Nugroho said he was located 300 kilometers (190 miles) on the northern coast of Palu, nearer to the shock, and the number of injured and the loss could be greater.
Nugroho said that he was “completely ingrained, without any information.”
More than 300,000 people lived there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its employees and volunteers are moving to affected areas.
It said, \"It's a tragedy, but it's probably going to change.\"
On Saturday, the agency was generally criticized for not informing Pulu of the attack, although officials said the waves had arrived during the pre-war hours.
To share a rest of the video on social media, a man on the building level can hear people shout crazyly to the people below the street, warning everyone that the sea is coming fast.
Walls generally crash into the shore in minutes and take buildings and cars.
Reuters can't immediately prove the truth of the film.
The earthquake and the seafall caused a large power stop around Paru, communication cut, which made it difficult for the authorities to search for relief.
The authorities said the military began sending aircraft to transport aid funds from Jakarta and other cities, but the withdrawalers still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport is only rebooted for rescue work and will remain closed until October.
President Zoco Vido arranged for a visit to the Palou Centre on Sunday.
The number of dead in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
It's very bad.
Doseba said the world has announced that the police force of Guadalajara has arrived safely in the city of Palu, in the office hall, to avoid the oil cloths they have built, on the road through the disaster.
He said, “They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed.”
It's very bad.
When the rescue organization began its rescue work, some complained that a highly qualified foreign aid officer had been prevented from going to Paru.
According to Indonesia’s regulations, the funds, resources and people of the country can be opened only when the disaster is declared to be a national disaster.
It's not yet announced.
“It’s still a provincial disaster,” said Olya Aliani, an Indonesian Red Cross spokesman.
“When the government says, ‘Well, this is a national disaster,’ we’ll open the door to international assistance, but we haven’t yet arrived in this state.”
After the earthquake and seafall on Friday, Palu welcomed the second night, and the family and friends of those who lost their loved ones supported the storyline that changed the natural disaster, hoping that the miracle would occur to those they loved.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the waterway.

Canye West: The Singer has changed his name.
A singer named Canye West changed his name.
On Sunday, he announced a change of name on Twitter, writing: “The official name available is Canye West.”
The 41-year-old Wester used it as a nickname for a time, and he also used it as the eighth album, which was released in June.

The show's founder said he replaced the show's singer, Elena Grande, with \"Perfecture Reasons\" who cancelled the show.
In addition to his current career name, Wester once said that it had a religious significance.
\"I believe the word \"ye\" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and in the Bible it refers to \"you\", \"Wester\" in the first half of this year discussing his album with the radio host boy.

The U.S. should double its AI funding
In addition, investors and artificial intelligence enthusiasts who previously worked in so-called bells, Microsoft and Apple said that as China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research spending in the field.
These comments were published after various parts of the U.S. government issued AI announcements, despite the lack of a formal AI strategy throughout the United States.
China introduced its own plan last year: Its goal is to become the top of AI's new field by 2030.
Lee said: \"There's a lot behind all other countries, and double the AI research budget will be a good start, and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI.\"
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee repeated how many times the funds can be doubled in the U.S. for next major AI achievements.
Lee, author of his book Artificial Intelligence Super countries: China, Siem Reap and New World Order. This month he was published by Hotton, Mivlin, and Hakott, the CEO of China's new investment company, invested in Face++, one of China's most famous artificial intelligence companies.
During the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University, where he developed an industrial and intellectual system that gave him the highest rankings of a U.S.-based board of chess, later served as executive officer of Microsoft Research and as president of Song China branch.
Lee can compete in technical competitions of the former U.S. government, such as the Robot Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Program and ask when the next competition will take place to help determine who is next far away.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding.
Lee said: \"The majority of academic leaders are not Chinese, but are business.\"
Facebook, Google, and many other tech companies have worked on artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. strengthen its AI work.
She said, \"I think Dr. AI should get a green card.\"
In July 2017, the Chinese Department of State released the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Program.
Lee said that the National Fund for Natural Sciences of China provides academic institutions with funding similar to those of the National Science Foundation and other government agencies to U.S. researchers, but that it is of low academic quality in China.
The U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to attract partners from industry and the academic community, and the White House announces the establishment of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a plan called AI Next.
As of the National Science Foundation, more than $100 million is invested in artificial intelligence research each year.
U.S. legislation has tried to establish a National Security Council for AI, but it has not taken action for several months.
Macedonians conduct referendum on whether or not to change their names.
On Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum to decide whether to change their name to the North Macedonia Republic, which would resolve the dispute with Greece for decades, which had prevented Greece from joining the European Union and the North Treaty.
Greece is a province known as Macedonia, who insists that its northern neighbor's name represents its territory and rejects its accession to the Treaty of North America and the European Union.
The two governments signed a deal under the new name proposed in June, but pro-nationalist opponents argued that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of most of the people of Macedonia.
President Gölrki Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that the resistance rate was doubtful whether the referendum would reach a minimum of 50%.
The question with which to vote is \"Do you support joining the North American and European Union and accepting the Greek agreement?\"
Prime Minister Zolan Oyef, in his internal successor, said that a group of countries that appear after the fall of Yugoslavia, such as the European Union and the North Federation, would be worth the price.
Oliver Georgeyevska, age 79, said: \"I am here today for the country's future voting for young people in Macedonia to live under the protection of the European Union, because it means that our lives will be much safer for us all.
Despite the lack of legal constraints, enough members of Parliament said they would comply with the voting results and make them decisive.
The change in name requires a two-thirds majority of the Parliament.
According to the National Electoral Commission, as of 1 p.m. there were no reports of violations.
However, the voting rate was only 16%, compared with 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
Gjos Tanevsky, age 62, is a candidate in the capital of Scoppi. He said: \"I came out to vote for my little child, and Europe is where I am.
Maciton Prime Minister Zoran Seyev, wife Zorika and son Duschko, held a referendum on 30 September 2018 on changing national names in Macedonia and will open the way for Macedonia to join the North American and European Union.
Vladimir Kavardakov, 54, was preparing a fine-tuning table before the Parliamentary Building in Skop, and he was scrutinizing the tent built by those who opposed referendums.
Kawadakov said: \"We support the North American and European Union, but we want to join them in the wake of our mind without passing the service door\".
“We are a poor country, but we are very proud.
If they don't want us to be Macedonia, we can help other countries, such as China and Russia, to become part of Europe.
Prime Minister Majev said joining the North Testament would bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, with a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
\"I believe that the majority of people in general will agree because more than 80% of our citizens support the European Union and the North Treaty,\" Yerev said after the vote.
He said that the result of \"agreed\" will be \"confirmed for my future.\"
A poll released by the Macedonia Institute of Policy last Monday indicated that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum - lower than required voting rates.
Another poll conducted by a Marshall Talmar TV station showed that 57% of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they would vote.
The referendum wants to be successful, and the voting rate must reach 50% plus one vote.
A referendum failed to take control of the Western government for the first time since May of last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguro of the Manchester City team across the entire line of defenses across the Brighton team for a ball
Saturday, in Manchester, England, at the 2-0 Great Brookings in Manchester, Sergio, Aguro, and Rahim.
Aguiro looked back at the ball in 65 minutes and was easy to believe.
Argentina's predecessor received a ball in the middle field at the start of the game.
He ran between three Bristol guards and then head to an empty place.
Aguiro then found himself surrounded by four green shirt players.
It surrounds a backdoor, and then goes beyond the border of the Britton Block.
Then she sent the ball to the left, and found Stalin.
The British frontman used his first touch in the ban zone to send the ball back to Aguero, and he shot the ball at the right foot to the right side of the ball, and beat Matthew Ryan at the door of the ball.
McGraw, head of the Manchester City team, said to reporters: \"Aguiro is struggling for his feet.
“We talked about her playing 55,60 minutes.
That's what happened.
I was lucky, and he hit a ball at that moment.\"
However, in the British Premier League mix, Stalin has given the Sky's blue team a chance to gain initial advantages.
This ball appears in 29th minute.
Aguiro received a ball in the defense area of Bristol.
He sent me a good forward on the left.
Sain made several touch balls before he shot at the remote column door.
Sky's blue team's forward enthusiasts came into the net before going out of the field.
At 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday, the Manchester City team played their Premier League at the Rhineka Hall and the Hofenheim team at Rhinem, Germany.
Shertz wants to play the destroyer in battle, the Loki.
With the national team being eliminated in the post-season race, there are no more reason why the team should restart.

Trump held a meeting in West Virginia.
When the president talked about the importance of the Republican election in mid-term elections, he mentioned the case of the Supreme Court candidate Rent Kavano.
“Everything we do is threatened in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is a very, very important part of the system -- I was not in the race, but I was in the race, so I fought around for the excellent candidate.
Trump continues: “You see this very, terrible Democratic radical group, and you look at it and you look at it happening at home.
They decide to take back power through any necessary means, and you see the depravity and flow of behavior.
They don't care if they're going to hurt the other side, they don't care if they're going to have to die in order to get power and control, but if they want it, we're not going to give them power and control.\"
He said the Democrats' mission was to \"response and prevent\".
He said: \"In the last four days, you can see this,\" and called it Democrats, angry, defiant, and false.
He referred to the first Democratic Party in the Senate Justice Council, Diana Stanstein's name, which gave rise to a crowding.
“Do you remember their answer?”
What do you mean by this file?
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Yes, no, no, no, no, I'm looking for a closed body language - one of the closest body languages I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
She can't tolerate those people who tell their thoughts.
It's not surprising when I'm in the local party's \"modular\" radicals vote against me.
After all, in a group of Labour MPs, I'm the latest to be told that I'm not welcome -- because we've made our own ideas.
My parliamentary colleague, José Ryan, was treated the same way they were determined to fight anti-Semiticism.
For my part, I criticize that I do not agree with Jeremy Corbin's point of view.
In terms of the importance of responsible economic policies, in the area of national security, there is a contemporaneous notion that Jeremy disagrees with previous leaders on a similar issue.
The notice at the Eastern Labour Party of Nottingham said: \"We hope that meetings will be inclusive and effective.
This is what happened at the GC meeting on Friday night during the eight years I served as a local Labour Party member.
Sadly, today there is no basis for many of the meetings, and the \"friendly and more peaceful\" political commitments have been forgotten, if they did.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that different views are not acceptable within the Labour Party, and that each opinion must be judged based on whether they are accepted by the party's leadership.
This situation started a little too soon after Jeremy became leader because I used to think that colleagues who had similar political views began to expect me to be a 180-degree change in taking a position that I wouldn't agree with -- whether it was in the single market of the European Union for national security.
Every time I speak about the public development -- in fact, I'm not important -- there's a social media, and there's a \"growth, call for an election, call for a mid-middle-party politics, which says I shouldn't join the Labour Party.
And this is not my experience alone.
In fact, I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, because my comments are often political.
I'm very afraid of the professional spirit and determination of those colleagues, who have to face discrimination or ethnic discrimination every day, but have never receded.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that the degree of damage has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are not going to belong to any of the general churches, but rather to a narrower party, with each change of \"untrust\", motion or selection rules.
In the last two years, I have got a lot of advice to urge me to act low, not so loudly, and then I'll \"do nothing.\"
But that doesn't mean I'm in politics.
A 32 years ago, I was a small student, and due to the neglect of the Charles administration, my comprehensive school system did collapse, and since I joined the Labour Party, I have been trying to fight for better public service for those most in need, regardless of whether as a local lawmakers' department.
I will never hide my political position, including in the last election.
In the East of Nottingham, no one would question my policy position and differences with the current leadership.
For those who pushed on Friday, I just wanted to say that when the country is working hard to achieve Europe, it would damage the family, business, and public service, I could not understand how to waste my time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leaders.
In fact, though, I would like to convey an information that is not part of Nottingham's movement, but rather that my electors are not members of the Labour Party: I am proud to be able to serve you, and I promise that no such re-election threat or political advantage will prevent me from acting in accordance with what I think is in the best interests of all of you.

Two later attempts may make the last result very poor, but with no question, El deserves a victory for the interesting Tanant Supersystem here.
They are the only team in 10 teams with no success.
In the end, they've been excellent in defense, and they've got a better chance of winning the team, coach Peter Mudge having the right to be happy.
“So far, we have been tested in the game and we are still not lost, so I must feel happy,” he said.
Robert Cristo of Melros said: \"That's how much better they are than I can grasp.\"
Grant Anderson's attempts in 14th minute were led by Fraser and Cristo, but Scotland's captain Lauri Huss ate a yellow card, which was released by the Warriors and made Melrose's team take over on the number of people, and Jason Bagter caught an untimely attempt.
Christo extended El's leadership by using a dot ball, then at the end of the half, he scored it with a single try, and changed it to 17-5 when the midfield break.
But Melros was not right at the beginning of the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to score the gap down to 5 points.
Later, when Ruyarid Notte was making a mistake for a long time because of his heavy injury, Ehr's attempt to lead further through Taford McDore, he was scored by Kremo.
Al team chief Bill McFresson was then punished by yellow medals, and Melros once again paid for the team's replacement, but after the fierce end of the pressure, Bruce Colvin's attempts didn't score.
The main team returned, however, when Strand Hathson was beaten by a yellow medal when he fell out of the ball line and fell into a ball.
After taking over David Armstrong's square ball, the left-wing player Grego Henry was hit with a fifth try, and Kremo was nearly re-recorded when the game was re-launched.
The film's Still Game star appears to be preparing for a new career in the restaurant industry.
Still Game star Ford Killan appears to be preparing for the hotel industry, and has previously been found to be a director of a licensed restaurant company.
This 56-year-old actor plays Jack Davis in a popular BBC show, which is starring in her role and co-star Greg Hemsill, a longtime actor.
This partner announced that the upcoming ninth season of this series will be the last season of the series, looking at the life that Kirnan is living after planning for Craig.
According to the official list of records, he is a director of Alif Moon Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but sources of the Scottish Solar News suggested that Kirnan wanted to participate in Glasgow's emerging dining industry.
\"The Ocean is our own\"; the Bolivian hope that the Tribunal will resume its journey to the Pacific Ocean
Mariners are visiting at the command of the Navy who covers the rope in Labas.
A flag of sea blue is placed on the top of public buildings.
From Lake Carcason to the base of Amazon, we have a slogan: “The sea belongs to us according to the law.
Recover is responsible.
The desire to navigate over the Pacific again over the Pacific Ocean, along with the desire to strip the coasts of Bolivia into conflict with bloody resources in the 19th century.
These desires may have reached the highest level in decades, as the decisions taken on 1 October after five years of international court review such as Bolivia.
Robert Kalsadi, a Bolivian diplomat, says: \"Blivia has conflict, a spirit of union and a spirit of constipation, and, of course, a lot of hope\".
The State will have a large screen to view the decisions of the International Tribunal through which the The Hague International Arbitration Tribunal supports Bolivia's claim, which has been concluded for several decades. Chile is a responsible partner for approval of a powered port in Bolivia.
Evo Mollales, who was an amazing President of Bolivia, faced a controversial election last year, with many decisions on Monday.
He swore at the end of August, \"We're going to return to the Pacific.\"
However, some analysts believe that the court does not make a decision that is beneficial to Bolivia, even if it does not change.
United Nations agencies in the Netherlands do not have the right to decide Chile's territory, and they provide for the outcome of a possible conversation.
A Chilean expert on international law, Paz Zarate, said that the International Court of Justice, after having heard the final argument, decided six months in advance to describe the situation \"not too much\".
Moreover, over the past four years, the number of countries in Bolivia has not been promoted, but it may have been blocked.
Zárate says: \"Tonhai's problem is that the current government of Bolivia has been kidnapped.\"
He believes that Molales' provocateur speech has gradually wiped out all the good will that the Chileans left behind.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to keep the discussion together.
In 1962, both countries had not sent diplomats to each other.
The representative of Bolivia at The Hague Tribunal, former President Edward Rodriges Belsa, and the Tribunal, for its decision, decided at an unusual speed.
His speech will take Bolivia, a very difficult opportunity to open the New Year's relationship with Chile, and one of the \"controversys with common interests\" held in 139 years.
Kalzadira, one of Latin America's most popular presidents, has also denied that Molales is using maritime issues as a political confidence.
Bolivia will never abandon its right to the Pacific Ocean.
\"This decision gives us an opportunity to understand that we need to go out.\"
South Korea says that unless the United States can trust them, nuclear weapons will not be realized.
South Korea's Foreign Minister, Li Yun, said that if his country did not trust the state, it would not be possible to eliminate nuclear weapons first.
Lee spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He asked the leaders of both countries to follow the commitments they made at the Singapore Summit.
He said this because Secretary of State Pompeo appeared to have been on fire for three months after meeting Kim in Singapore with South Korea.
Li said it thought that it would be possible for the United States to end the Korean War with ongoing sanctions to make South Korea a \"assuming\".
The United States has a prudent attitude toward consent.
Kim and President Donald Trump both wanted a second summit.
However, South Korea seems to be the only way to secure its own security, and there is a general doubt that it is ready to abandon nuclear weapons.
The Pompeo program is scheduled for the second Kimet Summit, which will take place shortly next month.

John Edward: The most important language skill for the world's citizens
The independent school in Scotland maintains an academic record of outstanding performances, which was renewed in 2018 by another excellent test, which was shared only with individuals and groups in sports, art, music, and other groups.
These schools, which represent 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are committed to providing their parents and students with the best possible services.
The objective of independent schools is to help students adapt to education that is much longer-than-more, and to locate the activities they choose from and become citizens of the world.
As a department of education that can design and implement custom school programs, we believe that modern languages are still popular and required programs in school.
Nelson Mandela says: \"If you speak to her in a language that the other side understands, content like this leaves an impression on your mind.
If you use its language to talk to him, it will touch his heart.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot simply rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From recent tests this year, the highest rate of language in independent schools is seen on the top of the list.
A total of sixty-eight per cent of students learning foreign language gained a higher level A.
Data collected from 74 member schools at SCIS show that seventy-two percent of students achieve higher level A in Chinese subjects, while seventy-two percent of German students with sixty-nine percent of French students with sixty-thirds of Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland use foreign language as their primary skills for children and adolescents in the future.
Language as a discipline choice, programs in independent schools are arranged with the same emphasis as those in STEM courses (science, technology, engineering, mathematics).
According to a 2014 survey by the British Employment and Skills Commission, 17 percent of employment vacancies that have been attributed to employers are due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, it is increasingly important for young people to prepare for their future careers.
More promising jobs require multiple languages, which are very important in a world of globalization.
Whether one chooses to career in a career or not, if he learns a second language, he will benefit in the future from having skills with him in his life.
It is possible to communicate directly with foreigners, which automatically enables many speakers to lead the competition.
According to a poll conducted by YouGov 2013 on more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, seventy-five percent of people were not able to speak openly in foreign languages, and French was the only language using more than two-thirds of adults, reaching 15 percent.
That's why investing in language teaching is very important for children today.
In particular, knowledge of multiple languages in the developing world enables a child to have a better chance of getting a better job.
In Scotland, every school language is different.
Some schools are focused on more traditional modern languages, while others teach those views as the most important language in the UK by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whether your girls' interests are correct, there are many languages available to choose from in an independent school where experts in the field are employed as faculty staff.
The independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment for children to adapt to the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
There is no denying that a global business environment is still very important for the future of a country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered \"International Exchange of Skills\".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, which is diverse and well-known for their young generation in Scotland.
That's what we have to do.
John Edward is Chairman of the independent school committee in Scotland.
LeBron began on Sunday in Santiago, where he played for the first time in a Lakers' team
The fans at the first season of the Los Angeles Lakers finally came to wait.
Lakers coach Luke Warlton announced James would appear in the pre-season opening ceremony on Sunday, Santiago, where his opponent was the Denver Gold team.
But he didn't decide that she would go out for a few minutes.
Walter Washington's official website for the Lakers said: \"The time to go out is less than one minute than 48 minutes.
Lakers team journalist Mike Trudell posted Twitter that James might have come out for a few minutes was limited.
During this week's training, James asked if he had planned for the Lakers' six-season pre-season program.
He said, \"I don't need to prepare for the pre-season season in my home country.\"
Trump competes in West Virginia at the time of the race, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts his multi-sport event tonight in Wellington, West Virginia.
Trump plans to hold five races next week, the first in five, including staying in friendly locations, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump's elected Supreme Court judges are already in hand to confirm the number of votes, whose next goal is to get support for the upcoming mid-term elections because the Republicans may have lost control of the parliament in a November vote.
What's going on in the game competitions in West Virginia tonight? Do you look online at this point?
Trump competes in the City of Wellington in West Virginia at 7 p.m. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch the competitions in West Virginia online via YouTube.
Trump may have spoken at the hearing of the Supreme Court's judge, Bret Kawano, this week, as the Senate's confirmed vote was charged with having an improper sexual act one week while the FBI was involved in the investigation.
However, the primary goal of the current regular campaign is to help the Republican party in its coming November elections.
According to Reuters, the President's team is therefore calling the next week's five competitions \"inspired and supportive\" because the Republican Party is working to keep and increase most seats in the Senate and House of Representatives.
A spokesman who did not disclose his name to Reuters said: \"We are in a busy race, and parliamentary control is important in the president's plan, and he wants to travel to as many states as possible.\"
According to West Virginia Metro News, the contests planned for tonight will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wellington, Ohio, along with media reports from supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Trump will be visiting West Virginia for the second time in the past month, and he won over 40% support rates in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate Patrick Morrisi, who is behind the polling.
According to Reuters, West Virginia's political scientist Simon Haeder, \"the president is trying to help her in civil order, something that won't be a good signal for Morisi to do.\"
2018 Red Cup: The U.S. team, in order to keep hope, shows its determination to strive for a Sunday's singles game
After the three-part games, the four players on Saturday may already be required for this occasion.
A clock-strengthening force can be a completely formed sport concept, but the athletes really agree with the term, especially in such a game that an unprecedented belief exists.
So they're going to be able to talk at home?
“They led the first six points, while the home was four, so I felt a little bit less of a situation than we were.”
Of course, there are advantages in Europe, which are already four-quarters ahead of them, and more than twelve are in the race.
However, as Spits said, the U.S. team was of interest to them because there were a lot of things that gave them confidence that there was a co-operative match between S.S. and Justin Thomas throughout the day, and everyone made three points in four.
Spice's been a great model on the golf field.
When he turns around to Spyth, he chases the game into four-quarters with a key push, and the cheering around him is more loud, while he and Thomas go for two consecutive mistakes.
In 15 holes, he threw them into the ball so that they won the game and got the same cheer that you knew he believed the U.S. team didn't go out.
\"You really have to do all you can to focus on your own game.\"
All athletes are interested in this.
An extraordinary 18 holes can be achieved.
The only members of the sports team that oversaw the last two days were Francisco Morinary and Tommy Flitwood, legends of the Ryde Cup.
Europeans are a team that is celebrated and loved by the world, winning four and never made a mistake.
Whether Friday is the second half of a Friday's Friday or on Friday's Friday, the \"Moliwood\" is the only combination that hasn't played any more than one click.
During that round, their energy flows to hot-air audiences, where a Sunday-winning athlete is a fixed game, and when the sun shines at the National Golf Club, there are no other stars that could be European won.
It's better to synchronize both on different holes.
It's a long time before Europe's glory.
Bamba Watson and Weber Simpson win Alexander Norren and Sergio Gassia's team against the four players of this game, Sergio Gacia.
The last half hit a supersonic blow that led to the fall of Spanish and Swedish players, making it difficult to climb back and forth again.
Although it's Sunday, no one can help you get back to your place.
The 4th and 4th games are wonderful because there are interactions between combinations, which make it possible for them to get along well with uncompromising suggestions, and the strategy of a change in war that is worth looking at.
To date, Europe has seen better as a team to play its final day with obvious advantages entering the game, but in the fourth season, the American team has also shown their ambitions for the game, although some people, especially those in the United States, had previously held suspicions.
The European team led 10-6 in the last day of the Red Cup.
After the European team takes the lead in the American team at 10-6 on Saturday, the European team will enter the last day of the Rhyde Cup with obvious advantages.
Encouraged by this film, Tom Fletwood and Francisco Morinali won the struggle for Tiger Woods in two wins, they drew their score to four points at the national Golf Club.
On behalf of the European team, Thomas Bijon, on behalf of the European team, meant to take back the two-year-old Hazeltine lost, and to win the fire in the four teams today.
Although the U.S. team won two games in four players, it was still impossible to change the back.
Jim Fox, on the other hand, wants to keep a medal and must win 8 points in 12 singles on Sunday.
Flietwood is the first European team to win four points, and he and Morinary's combination \"Moliwood\" became the second pair to win four points in the initial four matches in the Riddle Cup history after a vibration weekend.
After scribbing Woods and Patrick Red in the four-ball game, they perfectly joined forces to beat Woods and his new American team, Bryson Deschmbo, in 5 & 4.
He played for six and two games at a time, but lost 19 out of the four games and 7 out of all four players.
Justin Ross took his four-seater break in the Premier League, once again fighting his film, Henry Stenson, in the four-players to win two & 1 World rankings first and third Dasten Johnson and Brock Copka.
The European team in south-west Paris is not a round-the-sand-story.
Three Great Winners, Jordan Point, and Justin Thomas, have set a two-point base for the U.S. team on Saturday.
They won 2 & 1 for Spain's Jon Ram and Ian Boltt then returned to the stadium, where they won both holes in the four-player competitions at 4&3.
Despite the fact that Frick, the holder of the award, can keep a trophy by contrast, only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, are teams that can move back from 4 points to one player.
However, they are both row two on Sundays, and the counterattacks on Sunday appear to be far away.
South Korea claims it is absolutely unlikely that it will not be possible to lift weapons alone without trust.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions were deepening South Korea's confidence in the United States, where there was no possibility of North Korea giving up on a single hand.
Lee Hong has told the United Nations Annual United Nations Congress that South Korea has taken significant good- will action over the last year, such as ending tests and guided tests, and eliminating the site of the test and the promise that it will not boost nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said, \"We didn't see any response from the United States.\"
\"If we don't have any confidence in the U.S., we'll have no confidence in the security of our country, and in such a case, we're not likely to start uninstalling our weapons single-sided.\"
Lee repeats the Korean set of discontent with China, which has gradually become unnuclearized, and should be awarded a prize, but the progress of this \"stational\" has not been seen. His statements have been tasted and not rejected by the Chinese people as a result of the ongoing practice of the party's negative nuclear weapons.
Lee referred to a joint statement that was made at the summit held on 12 June in Singapore by Kim-in-chief Donald Trump, which was the first time he held a meeting with the U.S. President and leader of Korea, when Kim-in-chief promised to proceed with the \"non-nuclearization\" of the Korean Peninsula.
Korea has been seeking the formal end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has to give up nuclear weapons first.
The Republic of Korea has also resisted the call for strict international sanctions on Korea.
Lee said: \"The United States has maintained \"first non-nuclearization\" to achieve their purpose or even reject the declaration of the end of the war.
\"I think that sanctions will cause me to yield to those who do not know me.\"
However, the issue is the continued sanctions that further strengthen our confidence.
Lee has not referred to any plans for the US leader's second summit, the gold and Trump, as highlighted by the United Nations in this week.
The foreign minister also stressed that in the last five months, South Korea's leaders have met together against him three times, saying: \"If the issue of denuclearization was not the case in South Korea, Korea's denuclearization would not have been deadlocked.\"
Even so, Lee's remarks differed greatly from those of the old years. In ancient times, the United Nations General Assembly said that his aim was \"the rocket\" in a self-sacrificing mission, but Korean rocket targeting the U.S. continent was inevitable.
In ancient times, he also threatened to \"completely destroy\" the courage of Trump in South Korea this year to take action to lift his armor, although he also said there is still much work to be done to keep sanctions going until Korea achieves denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying: \"Two years, three years, or five months.\"
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should recognize the actions taken by the United Nations.
U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: \"The sanctions of the Security Council must continue to enforce without delay until we are fully assured that they have been nuclearized.\"
The Security Council has initiated a consistent implementation of sanctions against Korea for the purpose of cutting funds for the non-Proliferation nuclear and missile-guided programme.
Pompeo met with Lee at the United Nations General Assembly venue and said he would again visit wonderfully next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited Korea three times this year, but his last trip is not successful.
It was claimed that progress had been made in July, but that South Korea had condemned it for making the same request as the one that had been made in several hours.
At this month's meeting with the Korean side, if the United States takes \"recommended\" actions, it will destroy a missile field and a nuclear complex.
Prior to its claim, Mr. Kim was told that the \"recommended\" was a security guarantee previously pledged by Trump in Singapore, as well as actions to normalize relations with the House of Commons.
Harvard student training courses on getting enough rest
A new program at Harvard University this year allowed her to train more of her undergraduate students, with the aim of fighting an increasingly difficult Han culture with the power of caffeine.
Scholarship studies have found that students in the world's No. 1 universities often don't know how to take care of their most basic common sense.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, designed this program by women's hospital specialist Charles Czeisler, who believes that for the first time in the United States, there are these programs.
A lecture on the impact of sleep shortages on learning was started after the program was inspired.
“At the end of the talk, a female student said to me, ‘Do you understand what I’m going to say first?’
He never told me about the importance of sleep. I was surprised.”
This program, which was first introduced this year, gives students good sleep habits that enhance their physical qualities and help them improve the physical quality of their studies and exercise performance.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and executive director at Harvard University Health Center, said the school found that students had decided to launch this program after they had severe sleep shortages from Monday to Friday.
The course takes one hour, including a series of interactive tasks.
One of the rings is out of a room picture, where students click on coffee cups, windows, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effect of caffeine and lighting, as well as a less sleepy performance, as well as the importance of regular time.
In another round, participants were told that long-distance sleep shortages had increased the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with an interactive map encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
\"We don't know if this doesn't change the behavior of our students right away.
But we think they have the right to know. You have the right to know if you choose to smoke it will have a health effect.”
He also said that his culture of \"Silver Night\" remained, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that the problem of sleep shortages would become more and more serious.
He said that ensuring adequate quality sleep can be a student’s fight against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, and even avoid obesity, as sleep shortages lead the brain to enter extremely hungry patterns and keep them hungry.
A 19-year-old Californiaian, Raymond Sou, in the study of chemical physics, studied at the Czeisler class at the University of Old School, and later helped her design the program.
The program opened her eyes wide and inspired her to expand her curriculum into a school-wide curriculum.
Next, he hopes that all undergraduate students will have to complete a similar study project before entering a competitive school.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students consider setting up alarm alerts to wake up while taking care of the dangers of \"blue light\", such as electronic screens and LEDs, which can cause your bio-week chaos and lead to difficulty in sleep.
Livingston 1-0 wanderers: A ball score who joins Gerald's team
Dolly Minga's one-step shot at Stephen Gerald's team in Livingston, where the wanderers experienced a non-state tragedy.
After Ebrockes won 4-1 in February on the other side of St. Johnston, he tried to record their first victory on the road, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerald into a second battle in 18 games and successfully left his team with 8 points behind the inescapable Premier League leader in Haz.
In addition, seven minutes before the end of the semi-station, there is a lack of peace in the case of wanderers, and the point of view is not on the same level.
The wanderers fell to sixth place, and Livingston climbed to third, just because the goal was to reach the top of the field after 100 years.
Moreover, there may be more trouble with a wanderer who, as a result of the injury on his head, is obviously caused by the injury.
Gerald has taken eight changes in his team's set of goals as part of the World Cup.
On the other hand, Holt continued to maintain the base of Livingston 11, which won one in Haz last week. This trained team could hit the opponent twice and should have made him happy.
The couple had the chance to control the ball, but Livingston was more skilled.
They were able to score in the ball for the first time in two minutes, before Aran McGlegg's goal was to pass Biccott Pitt, but this midfielder used a real mistake.
KGEN JABX saw Captain Craig Harcott after he played any sort of ball, and his defence video was only shot in the back.
The wanderers did control the situation, but for their performance in the border zone, it seemed to be bigger than their belief.
Alfred Morelossley, of course, thought that there should be a penalty when it came to a penalty at the time of his 15th takedown with Stephen Lawrence, but determined that Stephen Tomson refused to appeal for this Columbiaian player.
Wounders have twice the chance to shoot targets in the first half, but for Ebrocks' former defender, Liam Corey, to say that Lasana Curibana's headball and Ovie Eyaria flat-spreading lead to almost no trouble.
Livingston appeared to be surprised at his first entry into the 34th minute, but by their efforts alone, nobody could deny that they were worth it.
Once again, the wanderer loses Jacobs's distance to attack.
When Declan Garach passed the defense line pass by Biscot Robinson, Scott Afield did not respond, and Scott Robinson remained calm and selected Minga to the ball score.
Gerald began his movement at the midfield to replace Curibally with Ryan Kent, who had an impact almost immediately, and a pendulum ball that led to Morelos, but was unable to break out of the defense line in surprise.
Livingston, however, continues to hang up the passenger team in the way they would like to play, and Risco and Harcot have a long history.
Holt could have led them in the last phase of their career, but McGreg kept a good hold on him and put Jacques outside the door before he lost his corner.
The wanderer's successor, Glen Midlton, made another request for a fine at the time of his dispute with Jacques, but Tomson won't take it back.
Inventor of the Year's Generator
The following is an annual page from the Sunday Morning newspaper: On 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, the time has been growing ... This day, future physicist Joanni Willheim Hans and Gaeze were born in Germany.
Gears invented methods to detect and detect electromagnetic radiation, which eventually produced a machine called a gear called a gear.
Since then, there has been no middle-classes in the scientific community, as well as the popular culture, and in the 1950 film Colorado Bell, Roy Rogers and Dee Ivans play no such role as these:
Man: \"What are these things that you want to eat?\"
Rogers: \"Goldeners,\" used to position radioactive minerals, such as potassium.
With this headphone, you can hear an atomic sound from the radiation of minerals.”
Ivan: \"I said, 'I'm sure the house is tight!'
Hans Gaell died several days from his 63th birthday in 1945.
However, this invention, named after it, has been spreading to this day.
New cancer vaccines can teach immune systems, views, and malicious cells
New cancer vaccines teach immune systems, look, and corrosive cells and destroy them.
A vaccine immune system recognizes that malicious cells are a part of the treatment cycle.
The method includes extracting immune cells from patients and changing these immune cells in the laboratory.
They can \"see\" the proteins common in many cancers and then inject them into patients.
Trial vaccines show positive effects on many cancer patients.
After a woman has received the treatment of this type of immune system that identifies the vaccine of malicious cells, she has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
This method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing these immune cells in the laboratory so that they can “look” at a protein called her2 common in many cancers, and then reinject them to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Besseda, Maryland, said: \"Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.
Prof. Berzofsky explains that HER2 will promote the growth of several cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and straight-cut cancer.
In the patient’s extract of immune cells, the immune cells do the same for cancer cells, and similar actions have been applied to the treatment of a white blood disease.
Canye West wore a MAGA hat following a Saturday night scene, as support for Trump was hit.
It's not good.
Canye West, in his studio, was hit by a voice, saying that he performed an unknown cloud show in the Saturday Night scene and praised U.S. President Donald Trump in the show, saying he will compete in the presidency's office in 2020.
She wore the third song \"Let America Be Great Again\" with its song \"Ghost Town,\" shouting out against the Democrats and reaffirming her support for Trump.
\"I've been watching white people many times and they say, 'You know what you're gonna do with Trump?
Well, if I don't mind racial discrimination, I've left the U.S. long ago. \"
\"Saturday Night Attractions\" invited Matt Damon to star in a humor small-scale film in which Hollywood star said that he had lied about what had been done before the Senate Justice Council regarding Christin Brysey's alleged sexual assault.
<seg id=\"8\">Despite the fact that Wester's episodes didn't broadcast the street, actor Chris Lock threw the piece into social media.
It's not clear whether Lock is trying to make fun of West.
West also complained to the audience about his hairdresser, and he was not happy with his back.
According to The Washington Reviewer, he said, \"They're on my back.
They're saying, \"It's not good to wear that hat out.\"
They've got me!
Then they said I was in a sludge.”
West continues: \"Do you want to look down at the lay-down zone?\" Again, it's going to \"Paper on my Superman tent, because that means I don't let you point my hands around and teach me a little bit.\" Do you want the world to continue going forward?
Try with Love.”
At least two calls were made to the audience, and a \"Saturday Night\" exhibitor appeared to be embarrassed, and some of them reported in the scene: \"Catholic\" into a dead room.
West was a very late invitation to replace singer Elena Grande, who died a few days earlier.
\"I Love It\" by Wester's show song \"I Love It\" was like a masquerade in Paris, making many people famous.
West was supported by TPUSA's leader, Candis Tener, who wrote: \"Give the most courageous soul: you are the one who fights with the Uyghurs.\"
However, the talk show host Karen Hunt posted a tweet, saying West, \"It's all right, it's all right.\"
However, I would never choose that person (by buying his music and clothing or supporting his 'art') award, which I think it supports and sprays in the same mouth are toxic to my community.
It's free.
We are all.” he added.
Before the show, the singer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that his home \"is officially known as Kanye West.\"
He is not the first person to change the name of Diddy's foot name, and Diddy is known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P. Diddy as the public.
Speaking of the singer, Snuby Dog, who used the name Snoby Lion, of course also had the late musical legend, the prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then the Prince of Artists.

Kid Harlington plays a sword role in the HBO's violent Mid-Day Fantasy series of power games, Jon Snowo, and is widely known for its role as the HBO.
However, this 31-year-old actor recently struck a lively impression of a hero, who had often felt that he had to be strong enough to be respected.
Kied, for his Sunday Times of Culture, says that he believes that \"some of the errors were wrong\" and that the harmful man's generalizations that were performed during the #Metoo era can be resolved.
The most recent collaborative star in the Game of Power is a 31-year-old Rose Lesley's marry Kidd admitted that she felt \"very strongly\" about this issue.
He said, \"Is my family very strong, or is it a mistake for me to be a man?\"

Kitt believes that a very maleized role on TV could partly strengthen the rationality of toxic men's general well-being.
He continued: \"Allows are natural, but what is later formed?\"
A TV television television television television, which seems to be a way in which teenagers know that a man can do this?
I think this is one of the big problems in my generation.
Because it's obvious that there's something wrong with the baby.
During the interview, he also confirmed that after the end of the Game of Power next summer, he would no longer play any role in the pre-release or re-release of the Game of Power, saying that he had been given enough to fight field and horse.

HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new confirmed cases
China has announced that the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Our country has more than 820,000 people infected.
Almost 40,000 new cases were disclosed in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases have been spread through sexual transmission, indicating previous changes.
Traditionally, HIV infection is spread rapidly through the input of infected blood into parts of China.
According to a meeting in Wennan Province, the number of people infected with HIV had almost reduced to zero by this way.
However, by contrast, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The problem of the spread of HIV through sexual behavior is serious in China's LGBT group.
China’s same-sex society was legalized in 1997, but listen to social discrimination against LGBT groups.
Our country's traditional perspective is conservative and research estimates that 70-90% of men and women eventually choose to get married.
The spread head of many diseases is inadequate sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed to universal access to HIV-AIDS medication as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Marx Walters denied that the party had leaked the data of the GOP and that he had strongly beaten 'potential lies' and 'spouse'.
U.S. House of Commons ( U.S. House of Representatives) House of Commons (Macsin Walters) accused one of being accused of having posted three U.S. Republican personal data to lawmakers on the website of Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrats say this is a very negative right-wing expert and website that have been spread abroad.
Waters has stated on Twitter that there is more \"truth\" than \"treasure.\"
Listed data are available in the U.S. state of South Carolina, Linsey-Greham and Mike, Lee and Olin, Hatch.
This information was sent by a stranger in Parliament Hill on Thursday as part of a House of Commons hearing for allegations of sexual misconduct against the candidate of the Supreme Court.
Three members of Parliament asked Kawano for a secret incident.
According to the House of Commons report, \"Gateway Pundit\" and \"RedState\" conservative media reports that identify IP addresses to the source's office relate to Waters' office and reveal information about Walters's office.
\"This must not be false, it is false,\" said Walter.
\"My Server\" is an official identity, personal data, and security that has been affected by fraud and false accusations, and is completely free of charge.
All false or false allegations are false.
Walter's statement was soon criticized by his colleagues online, including former White House News Secretary Ali Flech.
This attitude is angry,\" Flea said.
He has no gifts at all.
For something not done, it's all right.
You can't pick them.
They can't question the accused's motives.
They have to calm down.”
Flec seems to be more responsive to a floodwaters and the Democratic impeachment of Judge Kawano, who is angry with Kavano during the Thursday hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navaro has participated in the mid-term election to bring Walter down, and has also shown his feelings on Twitter.
\"If it's true, that's great.\" It's Twitter.
In his statement, Walter said that his office had warned them about the dangers of agencies and law enforcement organizations.
\"We will make sure that the accused will be informed,\" he continued, \"because they are responsible for any harm or personal security that they have done to me, as well as to all the authorities.\"
\"Could Beef Agent 3\" Reviews
Analyzing from a traditional perspective, it is now possible to find favors in any new film in favor of Brexit which will be applied to the play of the funny series \"Cell Agents\", starting out in 2003, while the \"Cell agent\" returned in 2011.
Can self-sacrificing content, which has no veiled theme, bring back to the audience?
For the second time in a round, Mr. Bean Agent 2 gets a issued license, with a large eyes, face-to-face expression, and a large variety of comic works, both elegant and cute, as well as its name, can be better than those designed by people in non-English.
He is, of course, that fool's secret agent, although his show of fun and humor is strange, some people like Klussa have a lot of his taste, and the London Olympics have been able to beat a sound in 2012 as part of the London Olympics.
He was born under Eggison as an American traveler and international philosopher who was well-known for his role in the Bakery Credit Card TV campaign.
There are two good shots in the latest JE exit.
I mean, Johnny and Ingli were wearing a mid-century helmet close to the helicopter, and the rotating wing collided with its helmet for a short time.
Egginsson showed great gift in the body language, but was humming enough, and much more specifically, such as 007 and \"Dign in the disk\" and \"Present\" film brands themselves are now serving as flavors for a bold integration into the active element.
This sense of humor seems to be suitable for many of the post-born children. For me, Johnny and Ingli laugh more than ever before, it's as if I were innovative and more sensitive as Eggson's voiceless films.
The current hot deal is that the UK is in a great trouble.
A network hacker has entered the UK's Superintendent Network and publicizes the identity of all field agents in the United Kingdom, making it a big surprise. Notable for this situation, Kevin Elden's strength is weak.
For a proud and four-sided prime minister, this was the last rice-forward which gave her a complete collapse: Emma Thompson's efforts to restore her original role to Teresa May, but none of the characters in the script have the power to produce.
Its intelligence advisors tell her that all active agents have been exposed, and that they must bring a retired agent to work with them.
This means that scathing Johnny and Ingle himself, a teacher of some nobles, is offering an informal class to become a base agent, which adds a joke as Inglea opens an \"Rocking College\" classes.
Ingley returned to the White House to join the emergency report and rejoined with Banboy (who was once again played by Ben Miller).
Boy's family is married to a submarine captain and is a very played character where some of them can't be shown on the show.
As a result, she is the favorite of Queen 007, where she once again has the bat and Robin who break things up and meet the beautiful killer, Ofia Brotova, who plays Oga Corlan's role.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is in a dangerous position to fall into the hands of a four-story technicaire who claims he can do some of the UK's computer failures: evil (Jack Lesy's play) Jason Volta.
Ingle and Bouy started their funny journey: they feigned as a servicer, burned a French restaurant; they built a messy themselves on Volta's luxury boat; they tried to use virtual reality helmets to get themselves familiar with Volta's interiors.
It was the last time I visited, but the whole process was full of joy and great pleasure, but there were still some children's TV taste.
A very sensitive section.
Like any other \"Boy Agent\" film, I don't think: Can't the British film industry create a truly beautiful role in Rowen Eggson?
The Labour Party denied that it was developing a five-day salary plan for the British to work four days a week.
The Jeremy Corbin Labour Party considered a radical plan that allowed the British to work for four days a week but received five days of pay.
The Labour Party is expected to take part in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Revolution and make it possible for workers to pay off for more a day.
Employees are expected to enjoy the weekends of three days of a week off, but are still leading the same money back.
According to sources, the idea is 'compliant with the Labour Party's economic programs and programmes to enable national welfare and workers to benefit themselves.
A change in working conditions for the week was approved by the United Kingdom Labour Union as this allowed workers to benefit from changing economies.
A senior Labour Party official said: \"Saturday Times has announced the outcome of a policy review by the end of the year.
\"This plan will not be implemented immediately, but a four-day working system is a wish that meets the Labour Party's method of rebalancing the economy and conforming to the Party's overall industrial strategy\".
The Labour Party is not the first party to support this idea, and the Green Party should be working four days a week during the 2017 general election.
However, this hope is not currently recognized by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said, \"The party has not considered this question as a matter of four days a week, nor of a non-party policy.\"
Shadow Prime Minister John McDonald used the last week's Labour Party meeting to describe the vision of the economic socialist revolution.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to return to the power of the \"anonymized director\" and \"sinners\" of the public service company.
According to the Shadow Cabinet's plan, it may not be possible for water company shareholders to double their shares, as the Labour Party's government may \"retain\" shares because they are perceived to be wrong.
He also confirmed that it was possible to allow employees to enter the Board of Directors of the Company and to establish an inclusive rights fund to hand over 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who received a share of up to 500 pounds a year.
Lyce Graham and John Gandhi say that the FBI's investigation of Kavano changed their minds.
The Federal Bureau of Investigations is investigating allegations against Judge Bret Kawano that the final vote for the nomination of the Supreme Court judges is extended for at least one week and that the results of the investigation by the authorities affect the withdrawal of support from any Republican politician.
During a Sunday interview, “60 Minute” program journalist Scott Pelly asked Republican senators, Lisa Graham and John Gandhi, if the FBI could find any clues that would change their minds.
Gandhi seemed to be more open than their colleagues from South Carolina.
\"I mean, of course,\" Gonddy said.
“At the hearing, I said, I’ve talked to Judge Cavano.
After this happened, the charge revealed, and I asked her, 'Did you do anything?'
He was firm, firm, and determined to give up on him.
However, Graham’s vote seems to remain unchanged.
\"I've already decided on Garret Cavano, which requires an explosive charge\".
Professor Ford, I knew what had happened, but I realized that Battery had denied it,” Graham added, referring to Cristin Brysey Ford.
\"It's not possible for anyone she mentioned to prove.
They're all 36 years old.
I didn’t find any new evidence.”
Are you sure you want to use this system? What is the relationship between reducing poverty and reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the annual concert of global citizens, and there will be a host of stars to showcase the whole scene, to do their best in public service; and to eliminate the world’s poverty.
This is the seventh global citizenship festival where tens of thousands of people went to the lawn of Central Park to see the performances of Jan Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mondez, with the aim of getting people aware of the importance of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Civil Society (GDP) is an international support group of poor people who are expected to participate actively in the fight against poverty, and in the fight against poverty.
To obtain a free ticket to a concert (unless you want to pay a VIP ticket), the audience often has to complete a series of tasks or actions, such as willing service, e-mailing world leaders, calling or any other meaningful means to raise awareness of their goals to eliminate poverty.
But there are still 12 years to achieve the goal, and how much success can global citizens have at this time?
In a way that gives free concerts a true reward for calling on people's ideas for action, or just another so-called \"net-click actionism\" . Is it really possible for people to want to write online or post a call on Twitter to make it seem meaningful for them to act?
Global Citizen said that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million supporters of the \"action\" prompted many different objectives.
Global Citizens says this move has led world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to $37 billion that will affect more than $22.5 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, the organization presented 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least $1 billion has been paid or collected.
The organization estimates that the funds received so far have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some important commitments include The Power of Nutrition (a partnership company headquartered in the United Kingdom with investors and executives), which is committed to helping children develop their potential fully. After receiving more than 4700 protests from citizens around the world, a $35 million commitment should be made to Luwanda to help end the country's poor nutrition conditions.
\"With the support of the governments of the United Kingdom, donors, governments and citizens of the world like you, we can make the nutrition poor social inequality a historic small clue,\" The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tresy Elman said at an present concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also said that after more than 5,000 calls were taken to improve the nutrition situation for mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funding for a project that would provide nutrition for 5 million women and children.
Recover common problems on its website. Do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?
Global citizens return: \"This will be a long and difficult road. Sometimes we fall and fail.
However, just like the great civil rights movement before us and the anti-racial isolation movement, we are united to become stronger, so we are successful.
Jane Jackson, Weyken, Sean Mondz, Cardi B and Jagarina Manne are participating in this year’s New York event, which will be hosted by Dipola-Le Lee Fornes and Hu Jackman.
U.S. Secretary of Home Affairs said it could use Navy, Block Russia, and block its energy exports.
According to the Washington Watchers report, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Jink said \"if necessary,\" Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from fighting the market in the Middle East.
Zink claims that Russia's participation in Syrian action, especially at the invitation of the legitimate government, is an invitation to the new energy market in Russia.
\"I think they're remaining in the Middle East,\" he said, \"but they're just thinking of themselves as middle-aged people, as in the practice of sub-Saharan Europe and southern Europe.\"
And according to this official, there are a lot of ways and means to solve this problem.
\"With this ability, the United States can guarantee the opening of the seaway through our own fleet, and, if necessary, it can also be blocked to ensure that their energy is not entered the market\".
CINK speaks to participants at events organized by the non-profit Consumption Energy Alliance, which marks themselves as \"Energy Consumers'\" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with the Russian and Iranian problems, noting that they were actually identical.
\"The choice or less use and replace fuels for Iran and the Russian economy\", he said.
In this statement, the Trump administration has been working to increase its LNG exports to Europe to replace Russia (a cheaper choice for European consumers).
For this reason, including President Donald Trump himself, an internal Trump government official, attempted to persuade Germany to withdraw from the North River Pipeline Project, according to a report by Trump, making Berlin a \"principle\" of Moscow.
Moscow several times stressed that the North Creek Project, which costs $110 billion, is a purely economic project that will double its existing pipeline capacity to 11 billion centimeters.
The Cremlin House claims that Washington is from the economic interests alone and is strongly opposed to the project and is a case of unfair competition.
Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, said in Moscow in September: \"I believe we all recognize that energy cannot be a tool for pressure, and consumers should be able to choose suppliers.\"
The U.S. position provoked a strong resistance from Germany, and Germany reiterated its commitment to the project.
The major industrial association of Germany (BDI) is called the U.S. Energy Policy away from the European Union and the BDI agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industrial Association (BDI), and President of the Russian Federation (Russia) Angela Mercel, recently said: \"When a third country interferes with our energy supply, I experience a lot of trouble.\"
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren \"Presentially Consider\"
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would “reasonate” his election to the president after the mid-term election.
Holliok, a town hall in Massachusetts, is a city hall where Warren is sure he will think about the election.
According to the House of Commons, \"The hour has come for women to go to Washington to repair the broken government, which includes a woman who has the primary position.
“After 6 November, I will run for president.”
Warren struck President Donald Trump in the City Hall and told him that he \"takes the wrong direction.\"
\"I am very worried about everything Donald Trump is doing for my democracy.
Warren has been openly criticising Trump and his Supreme Court judge candidate for Letret Kavano.
Warren said on Friday: \"Before we make a decision, of course we will need an investigation from the FBI.\"
However, a poll released on Thursday revealed that most of Warren's own voters thought he should not compete in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by the University of Saffolk's Political Research Center/ The Boston Global Journal, \"Verily 58% of Massachusetts voters are not supposed to vote.
32% of the people supported her election.
According to the poll, more people supported former Governor D.P., 38% of whom supported their election, and 48% opposed their election.
Other potential top-tempered Democrats to be discussed in 2020, including former Vice President Joe Biden and SenatorBerney Sanders of Vermont.
According to a report by the Associated Press, Biden said he would officially make a decision in January.
Sara Pelin is mentioned at the Donald Trump collection as a characterised by Chuck Pelin's insurrection.
Chuck Perlin, aged 26, served in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged on Monday night for domestic violence
He spoke at a conference that supported Donald Trump in Tarsa, Oklahoma: \"In view of the species my son is experiencing, the species he's experienced later in life, I can understand how other families feel about post-injury after the injury and some of the injuries that our soldiers are suffering after returning.
Pelin says that his arrest of his son, along with the rest of the veterans, was very different and became stronger when he said, \"They're coming back, and they want to know if their fighters, pilots and everyone else have been given respect for the country.\"
According to a spokesman for the Vasila Police Department, Dan Bennett was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska, and committed domestic violence against women in order to interfere with reports of domestic violence and alcohol holding guns.
18 states and Washington Districts support the challenge of new shelter policies
The 18 states and Columbia regions support an appeal against a new U.S. policy that provides shelter for victims of gang or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, 18 states and regional representatives submitted a court's friend complaint in Washington on Friday to support asylum-seekers in the lawsuit.
The United States Civil Libraries, known as Grace v, has not been disclosed.
He said that his partner, the son of a violent gang member, had abused him, but U.S. officials moved back to asylum on 20 July.
He's in Texas.
The State Counsel of Grace explained that there are a large number of applicants for U.S. shelter in Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, as well as that of countries facing threat and domestic violence.
The U.S. Conservancy Policy overthrows a decision of the Immigration Advisory Committee in 2014 which decided to allow illegal immigrants to flee domestic violence to apply for shelter.
Columbia District Minister Carl Rasin said in a statement on Friday that it was the new policy that was \"without regard for decades of state, federal and international law\".
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of the application, which are prohibited from violating the principles,” states the court’s friend complaints.
Counsel further argued that the policy of refusing immigration damaged the U.S. economy and that it was more likely that they would be entrepreneurs and \"provide the necessary labour force\".
In June recent years, Minister of Justice Jeff Cesins ordered immigration judges to provide shelter for victims of family abuse and gang violence.
The policy was announced on 11 June: “This kind of person can be protected by people of race, religion, nationality or particular social group or holding a certain political opinion or being persecuted or causing fear from his country.”
Preservation has always been a problem for easeling all the problems facing the citizens of the world, as well as for all the serious problems.
As a result of double the number of deaths, rescuers were arrested in the city of Palu for two seconds to try to rescue the survivors.
To the survivors, the situation is becoming more and more urgent.
\"It feels very nervous,\" says Lisa Cusuma, 35-year-old mother, \"is at the Departure Centre in Paulu, a disaster zone, to comfort her in the moment of her burning of a baby boy.
\"There's an ambulance sent to the body every minute.

The earthquake at level 7.5 caused hundreds of injuries and rise in the number of hospital personnel, resulting in severe hospital problems.
Some of those injured in the back and shoulders of Dwi Haris are off-door rest at the Palucian Army Hospital, where patients are treated outdoor due to a strong earthquake continued.
She recalls that when a strong earthquake occurred, she and her wife lived in the hotel's 5-story room.
\"We can't save ourselves.
I think I'm being crushed into the ruins of the wall,\" Harris said to the United States Communications Agency and added that she and her family came to the wedding in the city.
\"I heard my wife's cry for help, and then I heard her voice.
I didn't know what had happened to her and her kids.
I want them to be safe.”
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of \"advertising\" images.
The official Chinese newspaper has published four pages of advertisements to sell Chinese and American trade to each other, and a week later, the U.S. Ambassador to China has accused the Beijing government of using US media to promote propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday accused China of trying to interfere in the U.S. presidential elections on 6 November, referring to a paid press report published in the \"China Daily Mail\" (the largest e-mail newspaper in Iowa), which returned the charges.
The U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump had accused Beijing of trying to prepare for the U.S. elections and that it was a step-by-step move to Washington to keep the Chinese eye on the upgrade.
Invoice ads promote trade in foreign governments, Beijing and Washington shelves are in constant trade war, and the two sides have imposed multiple tariffs on each other's imports and goods.
Chinese and U.S. experts say that China implemented a tax return in the early stage of the trade war, an attempt to attack state support for Trump's Republicans.
The U.S. Ambassador, Former Governor of Iowa, Terry Brandstad, said that the Beijing government has damaged U.S. workers, farmers and businesses and that Iowa is the major exporter of agricultural products to China.
Blandstad is a Sunday's \"Duminal Report\" that China is now campaigning to restore teeth by publishing ads on our own free media.
Bramstad wrote: \"The Chinese government is using the United States tradition of freedom of expression and press to publish paid ads in the D'Mein Creed.
Instead, because the Chinese media are strictly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, you will find that against the streets of Beijing, where there are limited voices to see any real comments about China's disturbing economic tracks.
He continued: \"One of the most famous newspapers in China has refused to publish its articles, even though it doesn't say otherwise.
Analysts warned that the Republicans were far from women’s voters because of Kavano’s defeat before the mid-term election.
The Supreme Court candidate for a number of sexual assaults has been accused, and many Republicans still defend it, and analysts warn that in the mid-term elections they will be strongly opposed, especially from women.
The mood around this is very high, and most Republicans show that they intend to make a decision.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Sydney, said in a Saturday article that doesn't make a problem.
Reeher says he doubts whether Senator Jeff Frecker of the Arizona State Republican Party is the last moment strong enough for the FBI to conduct an investigation or not.
According to a press report in Washington, D.C., the forward adviser and national spokesman for MoveOn, Carlin Jean-Pier, said: \"Women do not forget what happened in recent years, and they forget about what happened on the same day, and forget about what happened in November.
Microsoft reports that, on Friday, as a result of the testimony of the Communist Party Association for the Control of the Justice Council, Ford has chosen to push forward the nomination for Kawano, the protestors rebuffed at the Senate Correspondence \"to come back in November!\"
A non-party political analyst, Stu Rosenberg, told the news website that \"the enthusiasm and momentum of the Democratic Party will break the record.\"
\"A lot of people say that they vote; it's true.
However, the voting rate may be higher, especially those who are rocking women in the suburbs and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who are above the feet of the President.
Even before Ford published a statement explaining his sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated that a strong resistance could be expected if Republicans pushed forward the nomination.
According to the NBC News report, former President of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steel, said earlier last week: \"It's a mess for the Republicans to say that it's been the same.\"
\"This matter is not related to whether the Committee voted or ultimately voted or whether Kawano was appointed or not to how Republicans deal with it and how they deal with it,\" said Guy Séssier, President of the Organization for the Election of Democrats.
However, after Ford's and Kavano's testimony, the Americans are obviously the same people who believe in a side-side problem, and obviously more people support the latter.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents are certain or may believe Ford testimony, while 35% say they are certain or may believe in Klawano.
In addition, 38% of people say that they believe that Kavano is a matter of fact, while only 30 percent of people say the same thing to Ford.
\"Defense\" reports that under Flec's call, the FBI is currently investigating allegations filed by Ford and at least another suspect, Deborah Lamires.
Ford swore last week by the Senate Justice Council that he was 17 years old when he was drunk.
Ramieres claims that during a party in the 1980s when he was a member of the Yale, the candidate for the Supreme Court revealed to him the genitals.
Inventors of the World Wide Web plan to create a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook.
World Wide Web inventor Tim Bernas-Lee is creating a startup that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend is an Inductor based on Solid, a company based on Bernas-Le open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose whether their data storage is a sideline and to allow people around them to access border information.
It was during a unique interview with \"Quick Company\", Bernas-Lee said that his aim was to \"rule the world\".
He said, \"We have to go home and relax.\"
\"This is a time in history.\"
This application uses Solid technology to allow humans to create their own \"personal online data storage\" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify can be used at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data storage is that people can access side information entirely by the user.
The company called it “a personal power through data.”
According to company CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inrupture is to enable companies to bring resources, processes, and proper skills to enable everyone to use Solid.
The company is currently owned by Bernas-Lee, Bruce (which previously created a security platform being acquired by IBM), and has signed a contract for working in the project as an active project developer and volunteer code agricultural community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using tools provided on the Inruptible website.
Bernas-Lee said that he and the team did not negotiate with Facebook and Google to introduce changes that would immediately completely disrupt all of their business models.
“We didn’t ask for your consent.”
Bernas-Lei, an article published on Medium, said that Inductor's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecological systems to ensure the integrity and quality of a new network based on Solid building.
Bernas-Lee established the World Wide Web Alliance in 1994 at MIT, changing the internet.
For the past few months, Bernas-Lee has been the influence of a network neutral argument.
Even when Inrupt, Berners-Lee is the founder and director of the World Wide Web Alliance, the Network Fund and the Open Data Institute.
Bernas-Lee added: \"I am very optimistic about the future of the network.
Bernard Vann: 1st Battle of Victoria Cross Celebration of pastors
The only priest to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I was held a celebration in his home country 100 years ago.
Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the award in the attacks on Belangelis and LeOkul on 29 September 1918.
Four days later, however, she was killed by the enemy, who never knew she had received the UK's highest military honor.
A tour into the town of Rashden in Northampton County opened on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said that the memorial was a sign of the heroship of his grandfather's award that was revealed 100 years later and is extremely symbolic.
According to the London Constitution, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Van En led his camp through the Battle of Marseille and a fierce attack on the St. Constantine Canal.
He later put himself on the front line, and led the army on a forward bow, and then, with only three gunmen, struck the team.
Lieutenant General Vann was the first month of the war to be killed by a German attacker on 4 October 1918.
Michael Vann, 72, says his grandfather's act of zero. I know that I can't do anything, but I will remain proud of these things.
His brother, James Vann, also known as James Vann, was a member of the Royal Youth Band after the end of the tour.
Michael Vann said, \"It's a pleasure to be on this tour,\" adding: \"The courage of the true hero has given her a lot of support.\"
MMA fans want to wake up the night bellator 206, and the result is a \"small pig\" Pitch.
Imagine that you wanted to look at Bellator 206 all night, but it was told that I'm looking at the main game.
The tickets from St. Joseph include 13 games, six of which are on the main scene and live all night on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6 p.m., the British audience was surprised when Gigad Mozas and Larry McDonard were ready for the PK because the images they saw turned into \"The Little Pig\" (Perch).
Especially for some people looking at the game over to sleep in the morning, it's said to this game.
A fan on Twitter who switches to a child's animation was \"something evil.\"
\"Bellator\" propaganda vice president Dave Schwartz was asked and featured in the show: \"The government rules that the content was played at 6:30 a.m., so they did not count on their children's show.
\"Small Pig Peck\" \"There's nothing wrong with it.\"
Scott Cook, President of Bellators, said that they would be the feelings of HAB viewers in their future programmes.
Cook said, \"When I get back to the game, I think I'm probably going to be able to figure it out.\"
\"But I want to leave home on Sundays at six o'clock, and we need to wait until Sundays work, and they can get this problem out of their own hands on Mondays.\"
But we're still working hard.
Believe me, when it switches the screen, there is also a large number of hints that come forward.
We want to fix her, and we think this is a technical failure.
However, this is the question of whether or not the government is a problem.
I can assure you that there will never be a second time.
We'll keep the game within five, not six, and by the usual practice, we'll set up a way for fans to play more, and as a result, we'll break our will.
The situation is good.
Isle of the island record: Tom Dallie feels low on sex.
Olympic jumper Tom Dalley says that he felt from a very small distance because of his sexual orientation, but he was able to succeed in doing so.
The 24-year-old said that until high school, he realized that everyone would like to talk to him.
Lawrence Ravne spoke on the television series \"The Desert Records\", where she openly talked about gay rights and gave hope to others.
He also said that he was not too interested in winning the Olympics after he was made a human parent.
John, a long-term actor for hot TV, took a few months because of his illness.
Dalí at La Vron's first show, she said that she felt that she had made others grow, because she thought that boys and girls were not accepted by society.
He said: \"To this day, it feels as if it's a different feeling, a real wilde that makes me successful in power and power.
When they found out their sexual orientation, she didn't want everyone to be disappointed, and she wanted to prove that she was a helpful person.
The two Olympic medal winners, already known as gay athletes, were present at the Australian Commonwealth Games this year calling for more countries to legitimize same-sex.
She says that she is lucky that she can be public without any influence and hoping that others will.
The three world champions said that they fell in love with American filmmaker Dastin Rans Black, who realized them in 2013, and was surprised that I heard them.
Delle married his 20-year-old Oscar winner in years past, but the gap was never the same.
You'll experience so much, and he's 14 years old at the first Olympic Games, and three years later his father died of cancer, and he's so hard to say that people with an age experience experience similar to that one's.
He was the father of Robert R. Blacky in June, a couple who said that he had changed his views.
If you ask me in your old age, I will answer you, I need to win a gold medal.
You don't know what solution? Because there are more important things in the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal isROBI.
Robert Robert, his father, was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Dellie says her father did not accept the fact that he was about to die, and last time she asked them if they could buy tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, which he wanted to sit in the front row.
She said I can't tell her you're not going to sit in the front row.
When she was about to stop breathing, I held my hand until she really stopped breathing, and when she died, I finally admitted that she could win.
The following year, Dali participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
He said that I still knew I had to jump in front of the Olympics and dream of my birth, a feeling that there was no substitute for it.
He also inspired her to choose her first song, \"Hether Smoll's Pride,\" which she associated with during the Olympic Games, but she still made her chicken.
At 11:15 p.m., four British Broadcasting Company broadcasts on Sunday's Fair Island Records.
Because Michaelson was in a bad state on Saturday, he was playing back at the Ryde Cup.
American footballer Phil Michaelson will create a new record in the Week's 47th Cup but it's determined to change its state.
Michaelson played for two years at the 12th time of his record and played for four players and four players on Saturday.
The five players who won the championship didn't play for the U.S. team all day long at the center of the tournament, but they used their time to do all the same for team leaders and their own games, hoping that this would correct their own weaknesses.
Even at the peak of the career, these 48-year-olds didn't play the most straight, and they weren't suitable for demanding a strictly national golf club, since training over a long period of time usually punished the wrong ball.
If the stadium was not afraid enough, in a Sunday's ninth tournament against British public events champion Francisco Molina, he and his new show Tommy Flitwood won four games this week.
If the U.S. team falls back at the start of the 12th single, there's a good start, so Michaelson's game may play a decisive role.
Frick had confidence in his men, but nothing else had to say.
She said she fully knew her role as a sheep today, slightly taking my back and keeping me informed that she was ready for the day she listened to me.
She has confidence in herself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame, and contributes very little to this team both earlier and this week.
I don't think she'll play two games.
I've got more, but the result is so, and that's the way we think we're going to do it.
She wants to go out and do it for everyone.
Nick Fardo creates the best record of next Sunday's Red Cup, but Michaelson is about to break the record.
This may mark the end of the Ryde Cup career, but its personal record is far from permanent.
In the 7th half, Michaelson was 18 to 20 times negative, even if Frick said he had given the team a new turn.
He explained that he was very funny and very intelligent, and that he was a very good teammate.
I've been with her this week. It's really interesting.
He's got a lot of things to do, and he's not just playing.
European team captain Thomas Bijon knows he won't lead the led soon.
With European team captain Thomas Bijon, the past experience leads too much pressure on the last day of the Rhine Cup alone.
Dean played for the first time in the 1997 Valdrama race, where he was the head of the team at Sef Ballettros, five points ahead of the American team, but ultimately only with the smallest gap of 14.5:13.5.
After watching Friday and Jan Day play for 5-3 ahead of 2018, you want to keep remind yourself that we've been leading a lot in Valdara Mall, and we've won a lot in Brooklyn and won the game in Valdara, but it's only risk that he's over and over again.
So history tells me that everyone in this team knows it's not over.
You'll be bored on the day you hear it.
Go out and do what you're supposed to do.
Your score on the black board is not over one day.
We have a goal to win this cup back.
I'm all right to say that I care about 12 players in my team, but we all know the greatest players in the world.
I'm glad to say that than Jon, his players are very good at playing such a hard golf field. In this regard, I'll never exceed myself.
Listening to the sun is another beast.
Listening to the day-to-day performance, it's something else to do.
If things go well, it's good to go out with the partners, but if you're out alone, you can test your full ability as a famous golfer.
To do the best you can on listening day, this is the information you need to transfer to the player.
You need to throw off your partner and you need to try to do the best.
Unlike Bien, the opponent Jim Frick wanted his players to play better than when they played alone, but Jordan and Justin Thomas were exception, if they asked for three points in total.
Frédéric was finally defeated in the final day and he was once a member of the big team of the Brooklyn team, but he failed to achieve \"Medinacchi's miracle\" in Europe.
Asked about the final day of the game, in 1999, when captain Ben Cromwell joined the players, he answered every word at that time with a clear statement.
We have 12 important games on Listening, but you want to see it in Brooklyn so quickly as you can see it in Medinak.
When this force develops in one direction, the pressure of the midfield will be great.
We're in the same position as we're, waiting for the players to come out with a fashion feel, you know, we're going to be going to turn the magic-lamp on the day.
Thomas is primarily responsible for taking everybody back, and he's going to play in the last half of last place against Lauri McRoy, while Paul Kay, Justin Ross, Jon Ram, Tommy Flitwood and other European players such as Lan Port.
When Bien came to his single game, I joined the group, because I felt it covered a process.
Germany's ships are further extended.
According to local media reports, the German Navy's latest defender should have been put into use in 2014 to replace the Cold War war ships, but due to system failure and rising costs, it can be put into use at least next year.
According to a military spokesman quoted in the German weekly magazine, the trial of the new Baden-Wuen-Wuen-Pfaz's main vessel, the Rhineland-Pfaz, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019.
This ambitious ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the problem was immediate.
Four Baden-Wubbling Guard ships ordered by the Fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Malémy class defender.
They are known to be equipped with strong guns, a series of air defenses and anti-ships, as well as a drop-in technology such as reducing radar, red-out and aesthetic characteristics.
Other important features include a longer warranty period, which should be deployed for the latest two years at the time of the mother port.
However, German journals noted that the extensions mean that the most advanced ships, which are said to allow Germany to project overseas, were out of service when they were in service.
In the past, this unfortunate F125 defender appeared on the headline, when the German Navy refused to test him and sent him back to the Blom-Fors ship factory in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned the ship to the shipyard.
The public knew very little about the reason for the withdrawal, but the German media cited the key factors of the left drop, such as software and hardware shortcomings, which made it impossible for warships to be used when carrying out their missions.
Softness is particularly important because the Baden-Wallen-Wallen-Package Protector is driven by about 120 crew members and only half of the human beings of the old Malémy class are required.
In addition, the ship is clearly overweight, thus reducing the performance of the active fleet and limiting the ability of the fleet to increase in the future.
It was argued that the weight of the Rhinephaz 7000 tons was twice as large as the similar ships used by Germany in the second world.
In addition to broken hardware, the price of a project, including the training of a crew member, has become a factor.
It is said that it increased from $2.2 billion in euros to an amazing 3 billion ($3.6 billion).
Since the German naval force was recently shrinking, the problems faced by the latest ships became particularly important.
At the beginning of the year, Hans Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's Defense Committee, admitted that the actual command of the Navy was no longer capable of deploying ships.
The official said that time had risen and that the problem had become serious because the old ship had retired, but there was no new boat.
He lamented that there was no vessel in the barden-Walkburch Level Guard that could join the Navy.
National Trusts thief away from bat's secret life
A new study was carried out at a well in the highlands of Scotland, with the aim of revealing how bats used the land.
It is hoped that this discovery will provide new clues about the behavior of this unique flying mammal and will help guide future environmental protection activities.
This study, carried out by scientists of the Scottish National Trust, will track high-pitched voltage, brown-long bats, and multiple-ton bats on the Westin Fru Garden.
A special log will be placed in the designated location around the hotel for bat activity during the quarter.
National Health Service staff and magazine volunteers will conduct mobile phone surveys with hand-held equipment.
A professional sound analyzer will determine the frequency of a beat's voice and the frequency of a by-product that will be tight.
A map and report of the destination will be produced, which will be a detailed view of what they are doing.
Rob Duva, a natural conservation consultant for the Scottish National Trusted Society, hopes that the results will show how much of a damp land is important for the bat and how much more he can use every bat.
Strawlands produce and do as best to maintain bats and other related species of forest, which will benefit from determining the beneficial edges of land management work.
In the last century, the number of bats in Scotland and all over the UK fell dramatically.
They are being threatened by buildings and development efforts, affecting habitats and loss of habitats.
Wind generators and lighting also pose a threat, such as the chemical processing of paper and drop-in building materials, as well as an attack by pet cats.
The bat is actually not blind.
But due to their late habits of eating, the ears are more useful than the eyes when they catch a prey.
They use complex sound positioning techniques to determine bugs and obstacles in the flight path.
The Scottish National Authority is responsible for protecting more than 270 historic buildings throughout the country, 38 important gardens with 76,000 ha of land, and highly regarded bats.
Ten trained experts conduct periodic investigations, checks and, at times, rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first special Bat Protection Zone in the Silver Gardens of Denver and Galway, where eight of Scotland's 10 bats live.
Property manager David Thompson said the park is ideal for them.
He said, \"We have a very good place for bats.
We have ancient buildings, many old trees and all the good accommodations.
But there are a lot of things we don't know about bats, so what we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to do before we can grow.
He emphasized the importance of testing the bats until it was maintained within the property, as it could cause up to 400 female and young children to die or may result in the death of all local bats.
The bats are protected if they have been killed, disrupted, disrupted, or destroyed.
Elizabeth Ferrel, a Scottish official of the Bat Protection Trust Fund, encourages the public to participate in the relief.
He said: \"We also have a lot of wild animals to learn about, but only for many species, we don't know what is going on in their group.
Ronaldo went back to the charges of rape because the lawyer was planning to accuse German magazine.
Cristoiano Ronaldo claims that rape is a false news and that he wants to use his name to promote it.
Its lawyers began to complain about this alleged German newspaper, mirror magazine.
The former Portuguese and Juventus were accused of violence against the American woman named Catherine Meoga in the Las Vegas room.
According to a report Friday, she paid $37,000 for the woman, but it wasn't enough for her to pay for it.
A few hours later, Ronaldo was reported to have left to talk to 142 million fans in the video on live video, and then hit the newspaper with false news.
No, no, no, no.
This five-time gold medal winners tell the mirror that they all report fake news.
They want to sell themselves in my name.
That's normal.
They wanted to make me famous, but that was part of the job.
The player smiles and adds, I'm a happy person, and I'm all right.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyer is starting to complain about the charges in the mirror Sunday. They say that they are \"unacceptable reports\" about suspicious acts in the private sector.
According to lawyer Cristian Shellz, the player will demand a \"responsibilities\" that is likely to result in the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The incident reportedly occurred in a suite at the Palm Tree Resort in Las Vegas in June 2009.
The documents submitted by the Clark County Court in Nevada show that after meeting with Ronaldo and Meoga at the night club, they come back to the player's room and commit rape there.
Meoga claims that Ronaldo bowed his knees after an alleged incident and said that \"99%\" was a good man, but \"1%\" disappointed him.
Document claims Ronaldo admitted that the sex of the situation was committed but both parties agreed.
Meoga also claimed that she had gone to the police station to shoot a low-injury picture at a hospital, but later because she felt that she would be repaid and worried about being publicly defamed, she agreed to an outdoor reconciliation.
This 34-year-old woman says that she is seeking to break the reconciliation agreement and that her heart is constantly wounded.
Ronaldo was planning to join the Royal Madri team at the time of the alleged invasion, and this summer he signed a contract with the Juventus II giants at a price of $100 million.
Brexit UK: Britain Will Repent to Lose Automotive Manufacturers Forever
Business Minister Greg Clark said the UK will never regret losing its position as the world leader in automotive manufacturing if the UK loses its position after leaving Europe.
He also said that if the United Kingdom had left the European Union without a deal, it would have been a matter of concern that its production would have been suspended at the Bernaston plant near Dubai.
Mr. Clark said we need to reach a deal.
Japan's automotive manufacturer says that if the EU does not agree, the impact of the border delay may lead to unemployment.
The former produced nearly 150,000 cars, of which 90% were exported to other parts of the European Union.
Marvin Cook, General Manager of Bernaston Factory, said my point of view is that if the United Kingdom left the European Union at the end of March, our factory will stop.
Other British automakers, including Honda, Boma and Jaguar Road Tiger, were concerned that cross-border trade would leave the European Union without a deal.
BMW manufacturers, for example, say that after Brexit, Britain will close small factories in Oxford for a month.
The main concerns are about supply chain risks said by automakers to be in the absence of an agreement.
Honda's production line is designed to operate on time, and suppliers of the United Kingdom and the European Union supply parts every 37 minutes for the production of cars.
If the United Kingdom left the European Union without a deal reached on 29 March, there might be confusion on the border, with insiders saying that this could lead to delays and spare parts.
The company said that it was unlikely that Fengta's stock at the Debi County Factory would fall within one day, and that production would stop if this was the case.
Clark said Teresa May had a left-handed check on the future of the European Union's Chix program to avoid doing this in border areas.
She and BBC 4 present show that we want to get the best out of the way, not only to enjoy our current success, but also to take this opportunity.
There is evidence from other producers that we definitely need to continue this very successful supply chain.
Fonta could not talk about the specific time of the suspension, but in the long run it has been warned that increased costs will reduce the competition of the factory and ultimately lead to unemployment.
Peter worked at the Bernaston plant for 24 years, and a co-congregator for the union, saying his members were increasingly concerned: In my experience, they lost their jobs, and they never came back to the Lama.
A government spokesman said that we have proposed a solid and credible plan for future relations with the European Union.
The White House said that Trump's meeting with logic might be delayed.
The White House said on Sunday that due to the ongoing dispute between Supreme Court nominees Britt Kawano and Deputy Attorney General Donald Trump may delay a week.
Robert Muller, a special legal adviser to the Roman government, investigates the relationship between Trump assistants and Russia and possible acts of justice by the President.
Trump will not fire the Deputy Attorney General in order to endanger Muller's independence, which has been a direct flow of speech in Washington, D.C. over the months.
Earlier in the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the conversation with Trump on the left-pressed cable record, as well as the possibility that the President would be freed through the 25th Amendment to the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
On the last week, however, she went to the White House and reported that she had resigned.
Rather, Thursday announced meeting with Trump at the time of the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he was willing not to dismiss Rosenstein, so the meeting was delayed in order to avoid conflict with the Senate Justice Council hearing. At the hearing, Kawano and Dr. Cristin Brassi Ford, who accused him of having committed unconfirmed sexual acts, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation to conduct a week of investigation into Kawano's alleged incident and to move forward with a general vote in the Senate.
Trump's News Secretary Sara Sanders appeared on Sunday in Fox News.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting: The date was not sure, probably this week, considering all the other cases conducted by the Supreme Court, I think we can delay for another week.
But we're going to look at it, and I'm just trying to get the media to know the latest.
This is the story: Since September 10, Sanders has never held a White House news conference.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked the question.
Although his speech would be little in reporting, it would not be because he hated the conduct of television reporters: I would agree with them.
He then suggested that Trump’s direct contact with the media be increased.
She did not provide any evidence that the President's answer to the question period before. We've seen this number.
Sanders’s statement is still going to be made, but if the media has the chance to ask President of the United States directly, it makes me feel much better.
We've tried to do a lot over the past few weeks, and you've seen us doing a lot, and when you can count with the President of the United States, it's clear that you've replaced the press conference.
Trump was asked to leave the White House or to attend a public meeting or a press conference.
Few personal news will be published.
This week, the President of New York may have proven to be having a look at the press in front of the journalist, sometimes looking strange.
The Secretary of Health wrote to the European Union on the issue of withdrawal from the United Kingdom to the European Union on behalf of members of the National Health Service of Scotland.
The Secretary of Health of the United Kingdom wrote to the European Union members of the Scottish National Health Service and expressed gratitude for this, and hoped that they would remain in Scotland after they left the European Union.
Scottish Parliament Senator Jane Freeman sent a letter without leaving the European Union until six months later.
The Government of Scotland has already paid for the costs of settlement applications for the EU citizens working in the public service ministry.
Ms. Freman wrote in her letter that in the summer, the United Kingdom and the European Union continued to take a hearing on the withdrawal of troops, hoping that it would be possible to make a decision this fall.
However, the British government is also prepared to prevent the arrival of an agreement.
I know that's a very disturbing moment for all of you.
This helps me to reaffirm that regardless of their nationality on the other side, I attach great importance to the contribution of each employee.
colleagues from the European Union and other countries added valuable experience and technology to enhance and improve health services and benefit patients and communities serving our services.
Scotland's your name, and I'd like to leave you here.
Cristian Abbelkronby received emergency surgery after his head was injured.
According to Mike O’Gengen of Tennessee, the team's head was wounded on Saturday, 31-27, and then on the left emergency operation.
State Coach Rod Rede said that the injury had not occurred before the midfield break.
Ryder said he came to the edge of the field and there was a collapsing point.
The coach and the medical staff took Abcoron more oxygen than they were in the field, and then put him on the stand and took him back for a step-by-step check.
Cris Harris at WSMV, Tennessee, a well-known official in Tennessee, is known for his left-hand work at the facebilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is currently no information about the type of injury or degree of injury that Tennessee is working to stabilize the injury.
Aberdeenbi is a second-year student of the Red Shirt Army, and is the first season of his studies in Tennessee after he transfers from Illinois.
He had 5 goals before he left the game on Saturday, making his total playtimes up to 18 times.
Foreign buyers will pay higher printing taxes when they purchase property in the UK.
According to the New Conservative Party's plan, foreign buyers, when buying properties in the United Kingdom, will pay higher printing taxes, some of which are used to help homeless people.
This approach will offset the success of Colbin in attracting young voters.
Illuminator tax will be imposed on those who are not taxed in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance plans to raise €120 million a year to help homeless people return to their homes.
Teresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will pay a higher printing tax when buying property in the UK, which is used in part to help homeless people.
This approach will be considered as an attempt to offset the success of Jeremy Colbyn's commitment to increase the economy, with the aim of attracting young voters for high-income people.
A fine-tuning of print taxes will be imposed on individuals and companies who are not entitled to taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional funds will be used to increase the number of people in government issues.
The added fee is that, in addition to current printing taxes, higher charges are imposed on second housing and renters two years ago, perhaps up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects this approach to raise up to €120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new building properties in London are purchased by non-British residents, making it more difficult for first-time buyers to purchase houses.
The country has many rich regions, especially in the capital, as most foreign buyers are abroad.
Boris Johnson calls for a reduction in the printing tax to help more young people have their own first set of housing, but a few weeks later the new policy came out.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high-rise prices by buying land and not using land, and advised Mrs. May to cancel the share of house applications in order to cover the UK's \"hated housing\".
Mr. Colbin announced a series of notable reforms, including rent control and endless driving.
He also hoped that the Parliament would have more power to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: \"I'm going to give the Prime Minister the post of Prime Minister to restore Britain's dreams, and every generation's life should be better.
This means repairing our broken property market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live here, work and create life.
However, for individuals and foreign companies not living in the United Kingdom, it is easy for British residents to buy house-to-house work.
For too many people, the dream of having a home becomes too far-reaching, and the insults against wanderers are still too real.
Jack Ross: My last goal is to manage Scotland.
Lord Sandland, Jack Ross, said its ultimate goal was to become the head of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottishs are enjoying the challenge at the Northeast Club, where they are currently ranked third in the Premier League, and three points from the first place.
After bringing St. Milan back to Scotland last season, he moved to the Light Field this summer.
I want to be a famous player in the game on behalf of my own country.
Ross told BBC Scotland that I got a top B-level hat, that's it.
However, when I was very careful, I and my dad watched many Scottish games in Hampton, and there was always a point where I was brought back to life.
While it's only when I'm successful in club management, the opportunity comes first.
The predecessors of Sand'Avotels include Dick Avott, David Moyes, Sam Aledes, Martin Onel, Roy Kien, Gus Poyet and Paul Dicanio.
The former owner of Alohe said that he followed a large and famous club and had previously rejected the proposal of the town of Baresley and Ipswich.
My success at home will depend on \"Can I Return This Club to British Premier League?\"
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, it certainly belongs to the Premier League.
It's not that easy, but if I can get the club back there, I'll probably just feel like I'm good at it.
Ross served as an assistant to the manager in Paterson, and worked for 15 months before entering the management career.
She helped Aloa recover from degradation to third, and transformed St. Milan from the downside to the championship next season.
Ross says this makes him feel good at any time in his career at Cled, Hartpel, Falcoc, St. Milan and Hamilton College.
He recalled that this could be taken over at the real cross crossing of Arloa.
I really think it's better for me to manage than playing.
It sounds strange because I do it well and rely on it to live and enjoy the happiness it deserves.
But playing may be hard.
You'll have to do a lot of things every week.
We will still fall under pressure and work pressure, but management is not wrong.
I just want to manage it, and I finally dream of becoming the true speaker, and I am confident of my entire adult life.
You can listen to a full interview on Sunday, 30 September between 12 and 13 p.m.
The survey found that Saturday at 5:30 p.m. was the best time for a beer-free beer.
The hotspots in the UK have raised revenue for fast- hold-on bars in the summer, but chain restaurants have increased pressure.
Data show that sales for restaurants and bar groups increased by 2.7% in July, but restaurants' turnover by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consulting firm registerer, wrote data that continued sunlight and England's participation in the World Cup was longer than expected, meaning that July was similar to the previous month, when the sales volume of the bar grew 2.8%, but the sales volume of the restaurant would be poor.
Restaurant sales in June fell 1.8% and sales in July fell.
Sale share of wine-based restaurants and bars has so far been the most profitable, compared with the decline in sales in restaurants.
Food-based bars also affect sales through heavy sunlight, although no restaurants are so serious.
All you need is to go out and drink a cup.
The operating wines and bars have grown 6.6% in the month, with a 3% drop in food sales.
Paul Neuman of RSM agency and hotel industry analyst said: \"We have seen from the end of April to the end of each trend.
Weather and important social or sports, which are still the biggest factors affecting marketing in the outdoor market.
It’s a great pain that the restaurant industry continues to fall into a low-strength, despite ongoing cost pressure, has fallen 4.8% compared to the previous year’s sales.
For food-based operators, when the cold summer occurs, time proves that we look at it and that we have a \"temperaturer temperature\" in August, and can provide an urgent amount of breathing in micro.
In July, the total sales volume increased by 2.7%, including new open bars and restaurants, reflecting the slow launch of the brand.
\"Café Tracking\" business monitoring software, provided for the British bar, bar and restaurant industry, collects and analyzes the performance of 47 operating groups, and drops the Group's total operating area of more than £9 billion, is a publicly recognized industry benchmark.
One-fifth of all users have a private social media account that will not let their parents know about solders.
According to the survey, one-fifth of them (one-fifth of them at 11 years old) have a secret social media account that is unknown to parents and teachers.
According to surveys of 20,000 middle school students, the more \"false\" pages appear.
The news also shows public concern about the release of pornography
20% of students said that they had a ' Master' account in order to let their parents go.
One-fifth of a generation (percent only 11 years old) they are creating a social media account, known as adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students shows that the \"false photo count\" is an image-sharing social site that is growing rapidly.
This added to the public's concerns about the release of pornography.
20% of students say they have a \" master\" account that has been cleaned up and they also have a private account - Photo Sharing Social Site.

Slaughter ads raise disputes online for comparing mother to cow
A sucking company has raised an online dispute because an advertisement has been issued which compares breast-feeding mothers to cows.
The company introduced a claim to \"the world's first silent and uncorrugated milk cleaner\". Consumer technology company Elvi has released a short-lived music-inspired film showing the freedom to present this new sucking machine to Mom.
The four true mothers danced along with the grassy cows, saying: \"It's okay, I'm drinking myself, but you can't see the tail\" and \"If you don't know these are not the cows, let me tell you that these are my breasts.\"
\"Pulse came out, pump came out, I tightened their baby, pumped it out, and stopped my breasts.\"
However, when this advertisement was posted on the company's Facebook home page, it caused controversy over the network.
This film gained views of 77,000 views and hundreds of reviews, and has received a different response from the audience, many saying that it depicted the \"dark side\" of the dairy industry.
\"Using cows to promote this product is not in a wise decision.
They all need to give birth before giving birth to milk unless your baby is born in a few days.
This Irva milk cleaner can be put carefully in the breast.
It's also said, \"It's hard to understand that it's a damage to mom and baby.\"
But there’s nothing wrong with it, and you can’t use them to promote this milk cleaner to feed your baby’s mother.”
Another add-on: \"A real ads are ads that are similar to reality reliefs.\"
Some people defend for this advertisement, and a woman says she feels that the song is \"frequent\".
“I think it’s really a good creative thing.
If I'm still breast-feeding, I'll buy one back.
Pump milk makes me feel like I've got a cow.
This ad is less crazy, but I'll see how it works.
It's a genius product. - A comment.
It's interesting to comment that when a mother pumps milk (usually in a place back or a bathroom) she feels like she's a \"bow.\"
He is not advertising or critical of the dairy industry.
At the end of the short film, these women revealed that they had been keeping the breast in their chests dancing.
The idea behind this movement stems from the profound insights that many women say they feel they're sucking their cows.
However, Elvi can do perfect silence, no radio pipelines, and be careful to put in breast milk, allowing women to carry the baby, or even walk out the street when pumping milk.
Anna Ballain, a partner and creative director of Mother's Mother, commented that the Elvi sucking machine is a product that has a new meaning and deserves to launch and try.
By contrasting women with cows, we hope to put milk and all of its challenges under the polylight, while showing the incredible freedom of the new shower in an interesting and related way.
This is not the first time Elvi gave a headline.

Hundreds of immigrant children emigrate to a tent near the border of Texas.
That is, the number of people who spend a month in temporary detention is largely unchanged, but the increase in the number of migrant children in detention is partly due to the harsh word and policy of the Trump administration, making it more difficult for children to receive a covered stay.
Most insurance providers are non-proof immigrants, so they are afraid that taking care of them will affect their ability to remain in the United States.
In June, the Federal Authority announced that members of the potential insurance system and their families who grew up had to submit notes, which would be shared with the immigration authority, making the risk significant.
Matthew Albens, an associate officer of the Immigration and Customs Commission last week, testified in Parliament that the agency had arrested twenty young people who had applied for security of their families.
The agency then determined that 70 per cent of the arrested persons were previously without a criminal record.
Nearly 80% of insurance persons or members of them are illegal entry, most of which are criminal foreigners.
So we're going to keep chasing those people,\" Mr. Alben said.
In order to deal with these children quickly, officials issued new rules requiring that their children appear within one month or another 60 days later.
A lot of people will argue with immigration judges through video calls rather than with themselves.
Those who are believed to be eligible for salvation will be expelled immediately.
According to the report of the hostel guard and the hostel system for several months, the longer the child stays, the more likely they are to become anxious or discouraged, the more the violence and the escape attempt.
The instructors say that in such large facilities as Tonylo, the above problems are more prominent, and as a result, children's problems are more easily overlooked.
They add that if it's not enough time for a child to get mentally ready or say goodbye to a friend, moving them to the tent area will only increase the child's risk of injury.
Syria asks the United States, France and Turkey, the occupying forces, to leave immediately.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid Mualim said at the United Nations General Assembly that the Syrian refugees had returned home, even though the Syrian war had entered the eighth year.
Mu Alim, Vice-President, said that the foreign army was using terrorist attacks to illegally invade Syrian territory, and that \"the people who violate the law will be treated accordingly!\"
\"They have to be removed immediately,\" he said at the conference.
Mu Alim insists that Syria's Counter-Terrorism War era is nearing its end. Since 2011, more than 360,000 people have died and millions have been expelled from the homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to fight \"until we clear up all Syria's territory, its fruitage, its terrorist organizations, and the illegal presence of foreigners\".
The United States has 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly providing military training and advice for the Turkish army and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar Assad.
More than 1,000 soldiers were deployed in France, where war-torn countries.
With regard to the refugee problem, Mo 'Alim said there was no problem returning refugees to their homes, and then he accused \"a few Western countries\" of dissipating unconfirmed lies and panics.\" The refugees were forced to leave.
\"We call on the International Social and Humanist Organization to facilitate and extend assistance to its fellow citizens who are willing to renovate their homes\".
\"They should have been pure humanitarian issues\".
The United States and the European Union warned that they would not provide any reconstruction support for Syria until the Assad and rebel agreements ended the war.
United Nations diplomats said that Russia and Turkey had recently signed a deal to establish a ease zone on the basis of the last major rebel force in Idlib, Syria, which would facilitate political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement has allowed the province to flee a massive Russian-backed Syrian army attack, which has a population of three million.
However, Mu Alim stressed that the agreement had a clear time limit. He said that it was hoped that military action would target the Saints, including the Nusla fighters associated with the base, who would \"remove the grass.\"
United Nations Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene, as early as possible, the first meeting of the new Committee, consisting of the Government and opposition, a post-war constitution for Syria, and to pave the way for the elections.
Mu Alim proposed the intention of the Syrian government to join the new committee, saying that the work of the new Commission should be \"checking existing constitutional provisions\", while warning against interference in other matters.
So Trump will be re-elected.
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will win a re-electment in 2020, unless the impeachment and rumors will end Trump’s President’s term in advance, as the liberals expected.
There's no question about it. It's the end of the story's most recent drama, President!
To date, there are no signals of fatigue by the audience.
Since 2014, the U.S. cable television news media has seen more than doubled its attention span, reaching more than 105 million, compared with Microsoft Broadcasting, which has nearly doubled its value to 1.6 million.
Nirson data show that the average rating for Fox News Gold Section reached 2.4 million, a rate that was higher than that of 17 million people four years ago, and that Microsoft's National Broadcasting Company's \"Recel Mado Show\" program won the top rate of radio shows in many news nights at a high rate of 3.5 million TV shows.

A large amount of foreign currency enters the House of Commons's most intense medium-term elections
The 17th district in Pennsylvania has a large amount of money due to the re-organisation of the parliamentary district due to two voters competing for a seat.
The recently re-drawn Pittsburgh district electoral district Democratic Party representative Connaranb won another election in the previous spring.
Ramb is competing with other current members of the party, the Republican Kestrosfords, for the twelfth Old District of Pennsylvania, which has a big share in the 17th district.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court established a map to redraw the old district in an unfair way, making it part of the Republicans' income.
In the 17th district of the Republic, the main party ran for the Finance Department, where the Democratic Party ran for the National Committee and for the Republican National Committee.
The name Lamb was given to the general public in Pennsylvania after a special election in March.
That seat has been held by Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the district at 20 percentage points.
Political experts and Democrats offer advantages.
The U.S. post-balanced view that punishment is greater than that of China, and thus decomposed.
The diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had recognized Beijing, while Washington had almost no anti-attacks.
Mr. Trump met President Juan Carlos Varera in June 2017 and lived in a hotel in Panama until his partner drove the management team from the Trump Group.
The U.S. Department of State spokeswoman Hessernort said in the month that the U.S. Department of State decided to \"recognize Taiwan\" for a reason to recall Salvador, Dominican Republic, and Panama's diplomatic ambassadors.
However, the Centre will punish Salvador, receiving US$140 million in assistance from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The fines imposed include the decimation of visa restrictions on economic aid against sex, which are no doubt painful for Central American countries with high unemployment and suicide rates.
During an internal meeting, officials in North and Central America delayed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic development as a follow-up to a similar meeting of the year, an important step in preventing immigrants from moving to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior executives made it clear that they wanted the meeting to continue and effectively end all consideration of the punishment for Salvador.
According to diplomats, Vice President McPens's house said it was a signal that it was expected that the meeting would be held in mid-October.
Three U.S. Ambassadors returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, but no information was received from Washington fines.
White House spokesmans have refused to comment on the argument of three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agree to discuss internal matters anonymously.
An anonymous external analyst said that they were confirmed.

The worst possible result may be a report by a special adviser, Mr. Robert Muller, about Mr. Trump's possible disruption of justice, which is well-founded in public records.
Mr. Muller’s investigation even turned around to see if Trump’s competitions were linked to Russia and thus attacked our competitions.
If Congress changes its leadership, Mr. Trump will find himself in blame, as he is ready to face the voters, and may eventually meet with the jury.
Since there are many possibilities, I don't even think that Trump's downfall system is inevitable - and I don't think that he's bounding with the European Union.
All peoples on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean need to make choices, which will affect the durability of war.
In 1938, the German army was preparing for a coup against Hitler, requiring Western countries to exclude him and support the Munich Czechs.
We failed, and we lost a chance to avoid the mass murder of years later.
History surrounding these points tells us that the steps that democracy cannot block are being accelerated or delayed.
The United States now faces many similar historical points.
What do we need to do if Mr. Trump will control Mr. Muller's investigation of fate, Deputy Minister of Justice, Rod Rosenstein?
Since the previous year’s report, Rosenstein suggested stealing a record of the president last year and guessing that he was in a deep-water fire.
Rosenstein's definition of \"Taiwan\" is not valid.
\"How will we respond if the new order requires the FBI to conduct an unfair and illegal investigation into Brett Kawano or if he's convicted by the Supreme Court under false testimony?\"
Overall, are we going to vote for Mr. Trump in the middle of the election?
If these tests fail, democracy will be a long winter.
But I believe that those things will succeed because I learned experience lessons in Prague.

Wanderers' team Graderlands remained positive in a conflict with the rapid sports team in Vienna.
On Thursday, the WWII's rapid sports team against WWII, which won a victory after an impressive match between Spain and Billy Ray, made them take a pretty strong position in the European Union Cup G team earlier this month.
The knee injury at the midfielder Gradlands made it impossible for him to start a show in the season with a 2-2 flat hand with the Billy Rays, but they were confident that the team could make better results by using this score as a jumpboard.
One 31-year-old player said: \"This is a good idea because the Billy Ray team is a good team.
“When we play, we believe we can get something to help us get the score.”
Or we can turn it off at the last time, but overall the flat may be a fair result.
They may have performed better in the first half, and we may be following the second half as a positive side.
Entering Thursday will be another big European night.
We hope we can get three points, but this will certainly be a hard game because they've already won a good score in the last game, but I'm sure we'll work hard to get a good score with the support of the fans.
In the past year, I've been injured and the club itself has changed, but everyone will still be happy in this place.
The team is very good, and the players enjoy it; the team is good at training.
I hope we can continue to work hard and succeed again, so we won't finish the season again.

Although the survey showed that participants clearly indicated that they needed to be taken care of, very few people would have to talk to their self-defensers.
Studies by the National Insurance Company show that more than half of participants say they have been with their partners over the long term of care.

Taking care of them at the same time as yours is a very important factor in determining the cost of care.
Here's your question: Your advisor can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term care fund can choose to include traditional long-term insurance policies and mixed casher life insurance to help you pay these costs, or use your savings as an insurance - if you have enough savings.
Set up your legal documents: Avoid legal proceedings on your passport.
Get medical insurance so you can develop a person who trusts in you to monitor your medical care and ensure that you do not know how to communicate with a professional if you do not know how to do so.
In addition, consider your economic license.
You can choose a trust person to help you make a financial decision and make sure you pay your bill when you have no ability.

Sala Pelin's son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Former Alaska President and Vice President Sarah Pelin's son, Mike Pelin, was arrested for allegations of domestic violence.
According to a report by the Alaska Police on Saturday, 29-year-old Pelin came from Alaska Shera, who was arrested and arrested for suspected domestic violence, causing domestic violence to interfere with the record and rejection of arrest.
According to police reports, an acquaintance woman tried to call a police officer to report her crime, and Patrick Pelin took her phone away.
KTU reports that Pelin is still being detained to the pre-trial institution of the Maoju period and that he needs a 500-$ guarantee.
According to the media, she attended Saturday, and when she was asked about her defender, she replied, \"There's no error in doing it.\"
Perine is facing three A-grade crimes, meaning she will be imprisoned for one year and be punished for $250,000.
At the same time, she is charged with a B-level crime, which will be detained for one day and fined $2,000.
Perine was not charged for the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of beating his father, Todd Pelin.
His mother, Sara Pelin, told the police about the attack.
The case is currently referred to the Alaskan military court.
In January 2016, he was charged with family damage, charged with domestic violence, and had weapons at the same time drunk.
Her girlfriend claimed that Pelin had hit her face.
In 2016, Sala Pelin linked his son's violent behavior to his involvement in the Iraqi military service to the creation of a positive impact on the injury, acting under severe pressure from the military.
The earthquake of Indonesia: hundreds of deaths

Federal Attorney General sought a rare death sentence on a New York terrorist attack suspect.
The New York Federal Attorney-General is looking for a death sentence on a suspect that killed 8 people in a terrorist attack in New York. This was a very rare punishment for federal criminals since 1953.
In October, a 30-year-old Ce波uff's taxi hit on a bike along the Manhattan Highway, killing all the people walking along the road with the bicycle.
According to a statement of intention to the death penalty submitted to the southern part of New York, the prosecutor must provide evidence that Sepov, deliberately, killed eight victims and caused physical damage.
According to the law, both of these crimes can be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the incident, the Federal jury filed 22 charges against Sépof, including eight murder charges often used by federal prosecutors in the organization of crime, as well as a law on violent crime and destruction of motor vehicles.
The Inspector-General said that the attack required \"a large amount of close planning and planning\" and that it was \"greatly cruel and morally corrupt\" to describe the terrorist attacks of Sebapov.
I would like to mention that “Sauvlo Habibrovi Sepov caused damage and damage to the family and friends of Diego Ink Angelini, Nicholas Clevi, Andrew Dica, David Duck, Aliel Elly, Elnan Ferli, Elnan Diego Mendosa, Alido Damian Panico.”
Five of the victims are visitors from Argentina.
Since the last lawsuit against the death penalty in South New York, it has been ten years.
In September 2009, Harry Bahn was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison.
Looking back on the execution of the death penalty in the last New York federal case, it was in 1953 that married couples Julia and Arthur Rosenberg were sentenced to death in the Soviet Union as they were recognized during the Cold War two years ago.
On June 19, 1953, he was sentenced to death in a electric chair with his married wife.
According to a court document, Seppov came from Uzbekstein, who did not show regrets a few months after the attack.
The police said she was very good when she told the investigators about her attack.
According to the complaint, Seppov and the authorities said he had been attacked after seeing the Islamic State video.
Police said Seppov also said he showed the flag of Islam in the hospital ward.
However, in the face of 22 charges, he said he was not guilty.
A federal public defender of Cyprus, David Patton, said they were \"very disappointed\" with the prosecution's decision.
\"We believe that seeking a death penalty, not a life sentence, will extend only these things to all victims,\" Patton said.
Sépov's defence team had previously filed a false sentence to the Federal Attorney General.
Conservatives say that Niejefalaki is responsible for Brexit negotiations in Britain.
A statement was made at today's conservative meeting by Najafalaki, swearing to \"Advanced People's Army\".
British independence leaders say politicians need to \"feel the strength of European skeptics\" because a Dressamey's own House of Representatives recommends taking responsibility for EU negotiations.
Conservative post-conservative Senator Peter Burn said in a tour to Birmingham that if Mr. Faraji served as Ambassador to Brexit, the house had already been released from the European Union.
However, Ms. Mayi's challenge was to motivate her split teams, and the Conservatives joined the anti-EU team a little more prominent.
In opposition to the European Union and the European Union, the Prime Minister strives to keep the Chix program in place.
Ally said he would continue his efforts to reach a deal with Brussels and force European skeptics to choose between their plans and the Labour Party.
Mr. Bern and the group Leave Means Leave in Sorichel, which he wants to get rid of.
He suggested that Mr. Faraji join the team and negotiate with Brussels.
He said, \"If she's responsible, we're going to leave home.\"
Senator Weilinger added: \"I will support Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chix program.
She said her opposition to the European Union: We do not want to fight the world war for humility.
We hope to establish our own laws in our own country.'
'The British people have changed their mindset, while the leftover method is completely wrong.'
A conservative party to the party said: 'I just want to say: Prime Minister, please listen to the voice of the people.'
The Chex Agreement was not popular and would not vote against it, which was not welcomed by conservatives and activists, and these activists would travel on the streets to make our first choice.
Please give up the chex deal, listen to the people's voice.'
Ms. Bayey's information adds: The Prime Minister can keep his work if he can comply with his promise.
Mr. Faraji told Congressional politicians that if they chose to betray the 2016 referendum, they would be \"unnormally passionate\".
She said, \"It's an appropriate place for our \"People\" political-level problems.\"
“They tried to betray the European Union, and today we want to tell them, ‘We don’t do that to you.’”
For more information, he added: ‘I hope you can make me feel passion and strength for their political order because they are at the edge of Brexit.’
Our active members of the national people’s army, who can win for Brexit, and never stop walking before we become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.
At the same time, the club toured in Birmingham and held an assembly for two hours in the center of the city.
Following the start of groups activity, some dispersion activists danced against the flag of Brexit.
Labour Party member Adonis said that the party had a problem during the opening of the Labour Party's proceedings.
' Based on what we know, they can have all systems of information technology that can be applied to Canada+, which can be applied to no friction border, and can be applied to Ireland' added.

Warren Plans to Give careful consideration to the election of President.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he will \"consider running for president\" after the November election.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaching the world champion after his car command to win the Bastian Vittel
From the moment Valtley Botas took the lead on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton obtained the ability to compete, it can be seen clearly that Mercedes's train order will play an important role in the race.
Starting with the pole, Botas had an unfeeling car, holding his position in the first two circles, almost leaving Hamilton out, and calling the Bottle against his teammates.
Vertel's entry into the vitamin area, allowing Hamilton to run into the currents at the end of the team's car, should have been decisive.
The Mercedess team entered the Maintenance area after a circle and fell behind Viter, but Hamilton took the lead in a round, which was not willing to leave the road after the Ferraris made an urgent turn in the third rudder.
Max Vistapan left the post-run line and ran seventh in the first round on the day of his 21st birthday.
After that, he was in the lead for most of his time, and he controlled his tires, and the goal was to finish the race quickly and get more than Jimmy Leaco's fourth place.
Finally, he entered the maintenance zone in the 44th circle, but in the remaining eight circles he could not improve his speed, so Lecco got fourth.
Hamilton said: \"Today's been a hard day, since Waltery was very good at the weekend, and he made me go through the past, and he's a real soldier.\"
The team did so well on the left and won the second place.”
Each reality is the worst body language
U.S. President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Stanstein at a Saturday session because he insisted that he had not leaked letters against Supreme Court candidate Brad Kavano's sexual assault.
During a series in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to the testimony provided by Ford in the Senate Council of Justice, which, in contrast, indicated that what happened in the Senate was \"huly, dirty, dishonest, and dishonest\".
He said: \"One thing that has happened over the last few days is something very good, and you can see a lot of anger, a little rage, a little rage, absolved, absolved, and unreality.\"
\"When you look at news and secrets, they say, \"Oh, I didn't do it.\"
I didn't do it.\"
Remember?
Diana Stanstein, do you have any secrets?
Remember its answer . . . The document does not reveal you - oh, oh, yeah?
Oh, no.
It's not that I'm leaking.
That's good. Wait a minute.
He followed me in the same manner as that of Congress: I was leaked. . . .
In July, Ford sent a letter to Stan, detailing the charges against Kawano, which was leaked early in September, but a denial by Stephen denied that it was disclosed by his office.
\"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story,\" said Parliamentary Mountain.
“She wants me to keep my secrets, and I also keep it in accordance with her requirements.”
However, with its refusal not to get President's approval, the President commented at a meeting on Saturday night: \"Let me tell you that it's the worst body language to listen to.\"
Maybe it didn't do it, but this is the worst body language I've ever seen.
The President continues to defend the three Supreme Court candidates accused of sexual harassment against women, suggesting that Democrats use these allegations to achieve their own ends.
\"They are determined to use any necessary means to take over the government.
You can see them, they don’t care about the people around them, they don’t care about the people who are left to get power and control,” the Mediaite website reports.

On Friday, a major earthquake occurred in the island of Sulawesi, causing the loss of more than 800 people and more than 800 people to die.
A strong earthquake continued to plague the area, in which many were trapped.
Although his colleagues were in a hurry, Antonius Gunaven Aahu, a 21-year-old man, refused to leave his seat at a severe rocking control room at Paru airport.
As a result, he ensures that he was able to fly securely by Flight 6321, which was already on the track.

He later died in the hospital.
According to Australia's ABC News, the spokeswoman for Indonesia's Air Navigation Company, Yuhanis Hilault, has decided to save hundreds of lives.
My plan is to send her to a larger hospital in other cities.
Unfortunately, I lost my lad before he arrived in Palu.
She said, \"We're all sorry to hear this.\"
At the same time, the authorities are concerned that the number of deaths may reach thousands, and the country's disaster relief agencies say access to East Gaala, Westji and Buton are restricted.
The agency's spokesman, Sutopo Pvo Nugloho, said: \"It is believed that the number of dead people is still rising, because many bodies are buried in remains, so it's not possible to arrive in many places.
The six-meter wave destroyed left Palu, where mass funerals will be held on Sunday.
Military aircraft and commercial aircraft are paying off their rescue funds.
In the 35-year-old mother, Lisa Cusuma said: \"Accuses are sent to each other's bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
“The small malls have been looted.”
Dr. Jane Galward and CNN, responsible for Indonesia's International Red Cross, said: \"The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don't know if they'll find the sheep on their side.
It's a tragedy, but it's probably going to get worse.\"
Indonesian President Zoco Vido arrived in Palu on Sunday, and said to the Indonesian military: \"I ask you to work all day long and to complete every task of separation.
Are you ready?” U.S. television news reports.
Earlier this year, an earthquake occurred on the island of Yokohama, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people.
New Guinea Airways said a man was missing after the collapse of Lake Elevator.
An operating company operating on a crash flight in the Pacific Lake in Micronesia indicated that a man had disappeared, which said that all 47 passengers and crew members had been safely withdrawn from the plane.
New Guinea Airlines said in a press release that as of Saturday, the company was unable to confirm the fate of a well-known male passenger.
The airline said they were working with local governments, hospitals, investigators to try to find the man.
This airline has not responded immediately to requests for more details on this passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The aircraft attempted to get water when landing at Chuc Island Airport, where other passengers and crew members were helping to rescue them.
Officially, seven people have been sent to the hospital on Friday.
This airline said six passengers stayed at the hospital by Saturday, and his condition was stable.
It is also unclear why and exactly what happens to the machine.
Airlines and the U.S. Navy say they land in a lake not far from the runway.
Some of the witnesses recognized that the plane was on the way.
U.S. passenger Bill Jones said the plane was very low.
Jenes said, \"This is a very good thing.\"
\"He and all other passengers are able to get through the water of the waist and to go to the nearest emergency exit point of an aircraft's fall\".
She said that she was scared by air traffic, and that she suffered a lot from her own head.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors who built the nearest haven also helped rescue the people by sending them through a filled-air boat before a plane sinks into about 30 meters deep (100 feet) water.
Data from the Air Safety Network show that over the past 20 years, 111 people have died in an accident involving an airline registered with PNG, but it has not been associated with New Guinea Airlines.
Analyst lists the time line for women to burn lively consequences late
On Saturday, the prosecution stopped the review of a man on the left, who accused him of being a woman in Mississippi who died alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rolett is an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He outlined that the jury used a phone to record the death of 29-year-old Quenton Teris and 19-year-old Jessica Forbes.
According to the report \"Clarion Ledger\", Rolett said that he received data about the positioning of several phones showing thatitects were killed late in Forbes, which was in conflict with what he had previously said.
Data shows that when she talks with her friend Michael Sanford, his phone is connected to Forbes, and the police go and find Sanford talking to him.
Sandford met on Saturday, where he was not in the city.
When the prosecutor asked him if he would like to talk about the truth, the prosecutor asked him if he would like to talk to the police, saying that his talk was true because my truck was in Nashville.
Another conflicting point is that he and he knew about two weeks after the death of the richman.
The phone record shows they've only been identified for a week.
Rolet said that at some point after Forbes's death,itelis took over the information, telephones, and contacts from his phone.
\"He removed him from his life.\"
The defence plan begins with a statement of conclusion on Sunday.
The judge says his pre-trial judgment will be delivered to the jury shortly afterwards.
The High Breed: What's going on?
A hip-hop trio would like to challenge the negative aspects of this music by integrating positive information into their music.
The High Breed group from Bristol claims that hip-hop music has departed from the political information about the environment and has been discussing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make it happen again.
Recently, artists like The Fugees and Common were re-emerged in the United Kingdom by Akar and Loki.
Another black man?
The New York Times has been fired because of “racialism” text messages.
The New York Times has filed a discrimination against women and men because she received an error message from her mother that she is \"a black man\" and that she has complained about it.
Those who deny their parents are a people of race, and they say, “I’m a liar.”
The two beautiful mothers, Lisa Plasco-Flaxman, when he returned from work on the first day of 2016, found a new child nurse, Jesse Morris, famous for black, and disappointed him.
Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote about his husband: \"No, but a black man. </seg>\"
However, she did not text her husband, but twice.
According to the New York Post, after being aware of her fault, a \"unsatisfy\" Plascofraxman fired Ms. Morris, saying that this would be a bad job for leaving the African-American govts, and he expected a name for the Philippines.
Ms. Morris was given one day's work and then returned.
Home, Morris contends with the couple, asking them to make a reservation on the release and requests that they resume work on accommodation for the first six months of employment at $350 a day, without a contract.
He said, \"I want to prove that they look and remember that you can't do this.\" He added: \"I know this discrimination.\"
This couple countered their claim that it was reasonable to terminate Morris's employment relationship because she was concerned that she could not trust her.
Her husband, Joel Plasco, told her: “I have sent her a message that she didn’t want to say.
He is not a member of a ethnic group.
We are not all ethnicists.”
\"But you're not going to hand over your phone to someone you've ever treated harshly, even if you're a single system?\"
What was your first birth?
That's enough.\"
Plasco compares the charge to \"responsive\", saying that his wife will be born two months later and is in a very difficult situation.
The investor said, \"You want to find the people like that?
It's not a good thing to do that.\"
Despite these cases, the court of Appeal has accused the couple of being on social media, fighting against them as well as logic.
Latest letters show that the publisher of Padington Bears is concerned that readers will not be interested in just saying what they say.
Karen Jacker, Bond's daughter, was born after being accepted into the book, and he talked about the time when he said: \"Before publication, it was difficult to place yourself in the position of the first person to read it.
It's interesting to know that we have learned a lot about the great success of the Patington bear.
Before being published and published by a bear, his father was a BBC photographer and had a positive attitude about his work. He also said that after his old father died, he published his 60th anniversary and that he was \"thanked\" for half of the book.
Regarding Parkington Bears, she described him as \"a very important member of our family,\" and said that her father was very proud of his final success.
He said, \"He's a very quiet person, not a man who talks.\"
\"But because Padington bears are so true to her, if your child has achieved it, you'll be proud of them, even though it doesn't really matter what you do.
I think she's doing that with the Parington bear.
Although this is its creation and imagination, it is all right for him to return to the Padington bear.
My daughter died soon. I had to talk to her on the phone.
After the plane landed, her daughter was immediately taken to the Louisiana Hospital in Nice to save her life.
Ms. Ednan-Rapprus said: \"Nad often calls to tell the truth is very bad, and she may not be able to go along with it.\"
Then I received a call from Nadda that she could not support two points, and I should say sorry to her.
I've done it.
I said, \"I love you very much, love you.
I'll be here to find you soon.
I'll get up with you.
The doctor has allowed his body to get away from his body.
He's just a little over, so he's over.
I just have to wait and wait, and I know that's what it's all about.
I can't cry out loud or cry because my family and others around me are.
I have to keep it.”
Eventually, she suffered the loss of her daughter, Ms. Dean-Luprus, and joined other passengers in the flight, and nobody knew about the pain of the calendar.
He said, \"No one can understand it.\"
\"I'm low, I'm falling down with tears.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I feel very strongly compassion for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much she loves him.”
A sad woman posted a card on a bridge to prevent suicide.
Two women who lost their loved ones because of suicide are trying to stop others from ending their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hendress posted cards on the Wilsbridge, writing encouraging words and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Ms. Davis, who suffered from depression at the age of 13, committed suicide at the age of 18.
She said, \"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day.\"
Ms. Davis, 45, said that she was a promising cook who smiles at an infection.
“Everyone knows him for a smile.
They said their smile light every house on the left.”
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was “a very dark place.”
In 2014, after Taylor's death at 11 years of age, he discovered his brother Taylor's brother.
Ms. Davis said, \"I'm just worried that there's a lock reaction.\"
Ms. Davis made these cards,\" so that those people knew that you could go and find other people and look at them, even friends.
Don't sit in silence like that - you need to talk.\"
Ms. Henfrises has been friends with Ms. Davis for many years and has lost her partner for 15 years after her mother's illness.
He said, \"She didn't say she felt depressed or depressed.
\"We took note of the change in its attitude on days before Christmas\".
Christmas Day is falling in its mood: it does not have any eye contact or other information with them when other chatpers open your gifts.
He said his death was a great tragedy to them, but they had to work hard to overcome it: \"This one broke a hole in the family.\"
She separates us.
But we all have to fight and fight.”

As the FBI began to investigate, the future of Bret Kawano's remains remained unsettled.
Flech said: \"I believe that if we really have access to a limited amount of time, as it is required, a limited investigation -- perhaps we can bring a small band together,\" he also said, \"if the Committee is really able to \"crash\" in deep-strengthening parties.
Does Mr. Kawano and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
They're completely due to time.
Five weeks from the mid-term elections on November 6th: If the Republicans didn't do as much as expected, then the party would be able to overcome what they wanted to be the Supreme Court of the United States.
George w Bush calls directly on members of Parliament who say they support Mr. Kawano. Kawano worked in Bush in the White House and, through his knowledge of his left wife Ashley, Ashley, used to be Mr. Bush's private secretary.
What's going to happen after the FBI released its report?
The Senate will vote, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear whether Mr. Kawano will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will make Vice President Mike Pence break the deadlock and confirm that he is in the Supreme Court.
South Korea 's
A South Korean lawmaker said that seven years after Kim's reign, the number of Koreans who fled to South Korea had decreased.
The killing of young people According to data from the Korean Union, there were 1,277 in the past year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Yuan said that the stricter border control between China and South Korea, and the higher cost of people's charges, are key factors.
There is no public comment on the square.
Most Korean rebels have been granted citizenship.
Yale said that after the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 Koreans were illegally across the border.
Most of the people are from South Korea, while China has the longest border between Korea and South Korea, and it is much easier to travel through non-militaries (DMZ) than it is for South Korea.
China views these expats as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and has forced them to return.
strictly speaking, the relationship between Korea and South Korea remains tense, but has been slowed in recent months.
Recently, leaders of both sides of the Korean side held a meeting in Moscow to discuss the issue of non-nuclearization of the deadlocked negotiations.
In June, U.S. President Donald Trump and Kimhine held a historic conference in Singapore, and both shared a wide range of knowledge about Korean non-nuclearization in the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, South Korea's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Lee, accused the U.S. government of taking sanctions without progress.
Lee Wong, speaking at the United Nations Congress in New York, said: \"We don't have any confidence in the United States, so we won't have confidence in our own country's security, and in this case we may not have the chance to lift our armor first.\"
Nancy Pelosi Shesdieri said he was not in the Supreme Court.
House of Representatives leader Nancy Pelosi Shestery claimed that the Supreme Court nominees Bret Kawano, in his position in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the above statement when he was interviewed at the Texas Literary Council in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
Perlosi said in response to a statement made by the House of Representatives by Bret Kawano on Thursday: \"I can't hold my breath, if a woman has ever performed this way, they will say of her \"Chestary\".
Britt Kawano strongly denied his sexual assault, and Cristine Bryce Ford, when they were still born.
Kavano was excited during the opening remarks when speaking about his family and high school, which he worked so hard at a time.
He also made it clear that the Committee's Democrats had accused him of being \"frightened and organized\" by liberals. They were content with Hillary Clinton's defeat in 2016 in presidential elections.
Pelosi says that he believes that the Proof of Kavano is not in the Supreme Court because he sees that he has prejudice over the people of the Democratic Party.
He said: \"I feel their words and how they attack Clinton women and Democrats, and he has not been eligible to serve in the Supreme Court.
When asked if the Democratic Party gets most of its seats in the House of Representatives, and if Kavano gets it she will attempt to impeach Kavano.
Pelosi says: \"I'd like to say that if she doesn't tell the truth to the Parliament or the Federal Bureau of Investigations, she's not suitable for being a judge of the Supreme Court, nor for serving as a judge of the court.
Cavano currently serves as a judge in Washington D.C. Circuit to the Court of Appeals.
Perosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned that the Cavano might make a decision on the \"Palestual Medical bill\" or the Roy ved. Henry Weide, who we consider to be a conservative judge.
At the hearing, Kawano withdrew from the question of whether he would overthrow some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
Pelosi thus says: \"Is it not good for me to go to a hyssop house and see the people going to the court and expect me to speak about it?\"
The woman needs to use her.
It's a just \"birth\" of anger that arose over a few months or even years, and it opened with a loud shout.
After 45 years, Ms. Steinham said to me, \"When I'm gone, I want to cry.\"
I think this is unusual, what do you say?”
She continued: \"At some point as a lady of the executives, she helped me a lot, and she said, \"When she's very sick, she doesn't become a skill, and when she's started crying, she's going to say, 'I'm struggling, and you're not happy?'\"
“I’m really good.”
Then she goes on to the race.
I think it's so good.
Water was allowed to issue as a reference method, and in part because of their error from the start.
What I did a few years ago in a man-dominated office, made me most impressed that I was not able to express myself very much with words. I cried out that a larger woman had caught me back then, and then pulled me into the stairs, and I was always surprised by the cold ice manager at a time.
He told me, \"I don't know if they know you're waiting.\"
They don't know you're right.
Because they caught you, they'd feel you'd be sad.
Patricia Schrode, who served as a member of the Colorado Democratic Party, worked with him in the presidential election of Gary Hart.
In 1987, Hart discovered an affair on a ship named Monkey Business, who left the election and felt frustrated that he had no reason to give up the president's election.
He laughed 30 years later and said, \"That's not a big decision.\"
There are seven candidates in the race, and they don't need more.
\"They call them the Snow White and seven little ones.\"
The matter has reached the finish line and its funding has fallen behind, so he swears that unless raised $2 million, he will not participate in the competition.
This is a vertebra of the loss.
He noticed that his fans gave him $1,000, but the net was $450.
He said, \"They don't think I'm a bad guy?\"
When he said that he would not raise a formal campaign at the time, he felt that he had a strong desire to share his experience with fans, which made it difficult for them to raise money and to give it to the electorate rather than to the representative system, and that he was very happy with the discrimination.
Shrode’s response to the news said, “Do you think I’m in the middle of the line?”
You all feel comfortable in my business sponsor.
I've been working on this day and they'll write on my grave.
“Is he crying?”
How many Chinese trades did she have in China?
Experts say that the cracks between countries can benefit from China's development, although the cracks of the Chinese trade war are not complete.
Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump issued a first warning against tariffs on major Chinese export products including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
In this week, the tariffs clearly apply to goods worth $20 billion ($150 billion) in exchange for nearly half of the U.S. exports from China.
China imposes anti-reactor measures on each pipeline, with a tariff of 5% to 10% on U.S. goods of $600 billion recently.
China is committed to driving the U.S., and the world’s second largest economy is unlikely to make a step-by-step in a short period of time.
In the U.S., U.S. let's say it's equivalent to losing, but in other words, public recognition of U.S. losses is too low.
Despite this, experts say that if China can lay hands on these cards, the pressure on the U.S. trade war could be reduced by reducing the dependence of both economies, long-term with regard to China.
A new U.S. security centre, an assistant focused on Asian research, Abigail Grace, said that a political decision in the United States or China could lead to a slide in the economy of these two countries, triggering economic growth and, in fact, a much more dangerous situation.
Syrian Foreign Minister said the Syrian government has prepared for the return of refugees.
The Syrian people have been prepared to return to refugee camps and are calling on people to help rebuild this country, which has been destroyed for up to seven years.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mualim said at the United Nations General Assembly that the situation in our country is improving.
\"Still has made great progress in fighting terrorists, and the local situation is relatively stable and secure\".
The Government will continue to repair areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal state.
Refugee refugees who are willing to return and return to their homes have no way of leaving the country because of the unilateral economic sanctions imposed on them by terrorists and on their daily lives.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their homes since the Syrian War in 2011.
Currently, 6 million people live in Syria, and they need humanitarian assistance.
Mualem says that the Syrian regime has been helping people of that country to rebuild their homes.
However, she stressed that she would not accept assistance from the countries that supported the rebellion.
The European team played in the Paris League Cup.
At the national golf course outside Paris, the club was finally held in 16.5-10.5 compared with the United States team, where the European team finished in 2018.
The U.S. team has lost six consecutive titles in Europe and has not won the Red Cup in Europe since 1993.
Danish team captain Thomas Bijon team against the United States team at 14.5 points and the European team takes over the title again.
American star Phil Michaelson played little good at the top of the game, especially when he played in the 16th hole of the three-hole hole, lost his game, Francisco Morinary.
Italian golfer Morinary performed well in these rounds, and from 1979 on, he was a 5-win-win-win 4 player.
The American footballer Jordan Spith loses at 4:5 a point in European team rankings as the lowest in the European team by Antonio Olison.
World's first American footballer, Justin Johnson, loses Ian Boltt, at 1:2 compared, probably at the last time in Bolt.
Spanish player Sergio Gacia participated in the 8th Led Cup and accumulated 25.5 points in order to become a big top-fill player for the Riddle Cup.
I don't always cry, but I can't stop crying today.
It's also a difficult year.
Well, Thomas chose to believe me.
I can take back the prize. I'm really happy.
“I am really happy to be able to help the team,” he said. \"With the help of the team, I am very happy.\"
He sent the flame to his compatriots-John Ram, who won the American Golf Championship at 2:1 for the Ryder Cup Personals on Sunday.
Ramese, 23, \"I won Teg Woods, and I'm proud that he's been holding me up.\"
Woods defeated four players in France, the current position of 13th against 21st place in the Riddle Cup.
This amazing data, he was one of the most successful players in history, and he finished 14 championships after Jack Nix.
In addition to Patrick Red, Justin Thomas, Tony Fino gave a high-quality play in a three-story golf game, while other members of the American team made a weekend effort to find a straight track.
The team was disappointed in their performance, and American team captain Jim Frick said: \"They've worked well and I'm proud of them.\"
For a while, we put pressure on Europe.
We canceled.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a good leader.
They all played well.
We'll re-assemble, and we'll work with the American Association of Professional Golf Players and the Red Cup Committee to move forward.
I'm really grateful for the 12 players who can be the captain of the team, and I'm so pleased.
You're going to pay her a tribute to your hat, except for your hat.
We've been out of the game.
