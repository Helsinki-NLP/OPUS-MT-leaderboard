Maltary sworn yesterday to set up a post-election commission (CEP) composed of 9 members.
This is the fifth CEO of Maltelli's four years.
Last month, a Presidential Committee recommended that the former CEP resign as part of a measure to push the country towards a new election.
This committee is the Maltary response to the protests that began in October against the government.
The demonstrations were triggered by the absence of elections, some more from 2011, and sometimes became violent conflicts.

In Harapa and Mohenzodalo, almost all houses have a toilet, which is connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
In the houses of Minos town in Creit and St. Torini, Greece, there are signs of sewage treatment systems.
In ancient Egypt, Persians also have toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets are all part of public baths, men and women are used by mixed men.
When you call thousands of miles away, you're using satellites.
The satellites in space will be re-launched almost immediately.
The satellites are using space telescopes because the atmosphere of the Earth has distorted some of our rays and vision.
A huge rocket needs to reach over 100 feet to send satellites or telescopes to space.
The most important contribution of the wheel is to make it easier for us to transport.
It brought us trains, cars and many other different kinds of transport.
Under them are medium-sized cat animals, and medium-style predators include rabbits, raccoons and deer.
Finally, a large number of small cats (including pet cats) are fed by small-scale predators, such as insects, mammals, crocodiles and birds.
Their success is in a proper division of labour, each of which is assigned a job to avoid competing with other cats.
The lion is the most socially accustomed cat animal, and they live in a group called Lions.
The lion is made up of one to three men of a blood-related male nature, plus as many as 30 females and young lions.
The female is usually close to a family of sisters and daughters.
The behavior of lions is similar to that of wolves or dogs, who act strangely similar to lions (but are different from other large cats) and are very lethal to them.
Tigers are powerful athletes who climb (although not good at all), swim, jump far away and talk five times as much as a strong human.
Tigers and lions, leopards and Cougars are the same animals.
The tiger's yelling is more like the lion's yelling.

Scientists believe that leopards are smelling what they used to hunt for animals on the ground.
Their ability to see the night in the dark, and they can move with their mouthless ears.
When a small group of organisms (a small number of smaller groups) separates from the major group of those they were born from (e.g., crossing the mountains or rivers, or moving to a new island, and they cannot easily return to their destination), they usually find themselves in a different environment from what they used to be.
The new environment has different resources and competitions, so the new group needs to develop a different approach or adaptability so that it can become a stronger competitor than it used to be.
The original communities have not changed at all, and they still need the same suitability as ever.
As time moves, these new groups begin to adapt to the new environment, and their differences with other communities are growing.
In the end, the two species will seem very different and will never be known as the same species after the millennium and even a million years of baptism.
We call this product formation, that is, the formation of new things, which is the inevitable result of evolution and is a very important part of it.
Plants release the oxygen needed for human breath and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans call it.
Plants are working together to get food from the sun.
We use plants to build houses and clothes, most of the food we eat is plants, and animals cannot survive without plants.
The dragons are the best predators of the time, so they're not afraid of anything except the dragons.

Although most of them are similar to us, the Romans also have their strange taste and unusual foods, including wild boars, peacocks, raccoons and an ants called sleeping rats.
Another difference is that the poor and the women sit on the chair and the rich love to sit around the party.
The ancient Roman foods could not cover the rest of the century until American or Asian food supplies were sent to Europe.
For example, the ancient Romans did not have rice, cheese, cacaco beans, or chickens.
The Babylonians will build a major temple for every god and the temple will be seen as a house of gods.
They offer sacrifices to God, and the priest will try to satisfy the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Every temple has an open temple and an inner temple that allows the priest to enter.
The Tower of the pyramid, sometimes called the pyramid tower, will be built as part of the temple.
The top is a sacred place of gods.
The house became less important because of the heat of the Middle East.

If you've seen the National Treasury, you might think that the Declaration of Independence drew a treasure map.
But it's not the truth, but it's not a treasure map, though it's written on the back.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the Declaration of Independence of July 17, 1776 is a positive version of the Declaration of 4 July. This sentence appears in the bottom of the document.
Although nobody really knows who wrote it, it's already a large piece of paper (size 293, 4 inches times 241, 2 inches) is stored in the early stages.
So it's probably just for labeling.
The Norman Landing War and the subsequent fighting have liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part of France is still unsolved.
The French people spoke to the Germans in 1940 and fought with the aggressors, not with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces invaded southern France, and this attack was called Dragon Ride.
The United States Army and the French Liberation Army have freed the southern France in just two weeks and then moved to Germany.
Civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people working and working (i.e. society).
The term \"Civilis\" is derived from Latin civilism, which is linked to Latin civitas (which means citizens) and civilisation (which means cities or states), which defines, to some extent, the rules of society.
The State is the front of the country, a civilization that means knowledge of several generations, cultural continuity and a certain degree of transmission.
The culture of a few ethnic groups is often lost without historical evidence and cannot be recognized as a true civilization.
In the course of the war, the 13 states first formed a fragile central government (which is only a component of Parliament) according to the Constitution.
The State does not have any right to tax, and since the state administration or the judiciary did not exist, it can only rely on state governments that often do not cooperate in order to carry out all the decrees.
The state has no right to overthrow the tax laws and taxes between the states.
The law requires the unanimous consent of all states to be amended, and these states do not respect the central government, and even the state representatives are often absent.

The winter movement is most popular in the North, where Italians also participate in international competitions and Olympics.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest of them in the state), making Japan the world's seventh island!
Since Japan has a group of islands, it is often known as \"censorships\".
Taiwan's starting point was to come back to the fifteenth century, when the European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa or a beautiful island.
In 1624, Dutch Indian companies set up bases in south-west Taiwan, began reforming indigenous methods of production and employed Chinese workers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Chinese army controlled the western and northern coasts of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Reich in 1885.
In 1885, following the defeat of the first Middle War (1894-1895), the Chinese government signed the Markin Treaty, which granted power over Taiwan to Japan, and Japan's rule over the island ended in 1945.
Machupichu is made up of three main structures, different from the Intivatana, the Temple of the Sun and three windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the building have been rebuilt to make tourists better aware of their initial appearances.
Until in 1976, 30 per cent of Machi Peicchi's been repaired, and the repair work is continuing until today.
For example, 35 mm is the world's most common static image photography format, which is also the most popular size used at the end of the simulation.
Even though production has yet to be produced, it is more important that it is followed by its long-scale image sensor format.
The names of the 35 mm format are a little vague, and it's actually very wide. 36 mm and 24 mm.
The long-scale ratio of this format (with the simplest Integer ratio) could therefore be described as three to two.
The most common form (e.g. the physical format of the first photography system) is the same as the size or the same size.
The three lines that are often used and laughed at are a simple rule and order in the image while creating a live feeling.
It points out that the most effective position of the main body is to divide images into three lines.
In this time of European history, Catholics have been subject to strict scrutiny because of their richness and strength.

Its power everywhere affects everyone, whether the king or the civilian.
One of the main Christian letters says that the use of wealth should be to alleviate hardship and poverty, and that the Church's funds are there.
The central power of the Roman Church has been in its history for thousands of years, and so concentrated powers and money has led many to question the compatibility of the letter.
Following the outbreak of the war, the United Kingdom launched a maritime blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved to effectively interdict the necessary military and civilian restitutions, but this blockade has violated international law, which has been established in the last two centuries.
In the international waters, the British has set aside any ship to enter the entire sea and to threaten the neutral ship.
As a result of its limited response to the strategy, Germany anticipates a similar response to its unbounded submarines.
In the 1920s, the majority of citizens and nations held the position of equivalency and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities caused by the war during the first world war, the countries want to avoid the future of this situation again.

He had four cents of deposits, a poem and a letter from Charles Bachel, the manager of his previous job, addressed to Thomas Edison to the United States.
The ancient Chinese way of showing different times is unique, and every family in China or power at every stage is a unique empire.
In each generation, there is a period of instability in the divided provinces. In these times, the most famous three-year era between Han and Kim has been the period of 60 years.
In these times, a great deal of nobles have been fighting for the throne.
The three-generations are one of the most bloody times in China's ancient history, and thousands of people have died for having reached the highest throne of the Western Empire.
Many social and political influences, such as the adoption of a system of public institutions, the shift from racialism to nationalism, and the idea that the State belongs to the people rather than to the sole rulers.
In addition, after the revolution, all occupations were opened to all men, bringing together the most ambitious and successful.
The same thing happened in the army, since the military is no longer involved with the class, but based on its ability to decide.
The French revolution has also awakened many of the oppressed working class in other countries, starting with their revolution.
Mohammed is deeply interested in something other than secular life. He used to come to the mountains of Noor, a cave called Hira.
The caves were made through the time of their trials, and gave them a clear image of the spirit of Mohammed.
In one of the mountains in the north of Makkah, this cave is cut off from the world.
In fact, even if you know it's not possible to find it, when you're in a cave, it's definitely a distance from the world.
It's only a beautiful sky and a ring. From the cave to the cave, it's only a small world.
The Gisa Grand pyramid is the only one in today's seven miracles that remain unsolved.
The pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the first three centuries of the year, and is used in many ways as one of the large pyramids in memory of the deceased Pharaoh.
There are several pyramids (the largest of the pyramids), several small graves, several temples and lions.
The pyramid was built to remember Pharaoh's Huf, while many small pyramids were built, and graves and temples were built to remember Pharaoh's wives and family members.
The symbol \"up bow\" looks like a V word, and the bow's mark looks like a cross or a square form that lacks the bottom.
Up top means you should start pushing the bow from the top, and you should start pulling the bow from the bow.
The bow usually makes a softer sound, and the bows make a stronger sound.
Write your own mark, but remember, the bow marks are for music, so in general they should be respected.

The US imperialism conquered the Philippines, and war expenditures were eventually borne by the Filipino people themselves.
In the name of the Philippine Government, they were forced to pay the bulk of their expenses and bonds through the Wall Street Bank.
Of course, the huge profit generated by a long-distance Filipino would constitute the basic proceeds of the United States imperialism.
We must be aware of the time when it will be created before we know what it's like to be the knights of the temple.
This event is often considered to be a mid-century anniversary in European history, i.e., 11,12 and 13th centuries (Certifest 1,000 - 1,300).
Before the middle century was the early part of the middle century, and at the late of the middle century, it was generally thought that the middle century would end around 1,500 B.C.E.
The technical decision is a philosophy that contains a variety of thoughts that are being implemented, from technically motivated or technically ordered orders, to the strict sense that human fate is driven by profound logic related to scientific rules and their presentation.
In most cases, there are two common perspectives about technology decisions: the technological development of itself goes much beyond cultural or political influence and, in turn, the influence, rather than social contract, of society.
Some might say, for example, that cars have to lead the road.
However, if only a few cars, a country-wide road network, is economically not feasible, new production methods will be developed to reduce the cost of having cars.
A lot of car accidents have also led to more road accidents, and new technology has been developed to treat the injuries.
Romanticism has a lot of cultural determinants from writers such as Gold, Fisher and Schlegger.
In the context of romanticism, the geographical environment has shaped individuals, and the customs and cultures associated with the geographical environment have emerged over time. These cultural customs are consistent with the position of society, which prevails over arbitrary and imposed laws.
As Paris is the contemporary fashion of the world, Constantinople is seen as the fashion of Europe.
Since 400 years ago, it has been known as a luxury centre, until the year 1100.
In the 12th century, its status fell, mainly because the Crusades returned silk, spices, etc., and they were more popular than the goods offered on the streets of the court.
From now on, the fashions of Constantinople have been handed over to Paris.
Gott's style reached the highest peak of the world in the 10th to 11th century and 14th century.
In the first place, the dress was designed to be deeply influenced by the culture of the court in the east.
But because of the delay of the Ministry's communication, the Western style of Gabidon has been followed by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its style of dress. The most significant developments at that time came from the Crusades, which allowed people to start using restraints.
The growing agricultural community has been able to produce only enough food to feed farmers and their families.
Lasting agriculture is a simple, mostly organic system that uses seeds stored in a living area and that combines the round farming methods or other relatively simple technologies to increase the production rate.
Historically, most farmers have been able to sustain their agriculture, which is still often seen in many of today's developing countries.
The subcultural culture brings together a group of people who feel that they are blind to the standards of society and that it enables them to develop identity.
Subcultural uniqueities can be derived from the age of their members, race, class, territory and/or sex.
Determining that subculturality and a variety of characteristics can be linguistic, cultural, religious, political, sexual, geographic or disparate.
Subcultural members usually show their member status in a unique and symbolic manner, including their dress, their conduct and their dark speech.
One of the most common methods of socialization is to raise a few unfortunate cases of children who have not been taught by adults because they have been neglected in their growth process and have been victims of unfortunate or deliberate abuse.
Some of these children, often called wild children, have been banned (usually their parents), while others have been abandoned by parents for refusing to accept the child's severe mental or physical disorder.
The wild children may have suffered severe ill-treatment or trauma before being abandoned or left home.
Some are said to have been raised by animals and some to live alone in the wild.
When wild children are raised by non-human animals, what they do (in the body limits) is almost the same as taking care of them, such as fear of human beings or lack of concern for them.
The topical learning should make learning easier and interesting, and the eagle theory is a step further.
Eagle theory is not a learning method, but a support to people who are experiencing a new learning process, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Eagles can be virtual and real, in other words, teachers can be a form of eagle, and Microsoft Office's small number of characters can also be a form.
Virtual eagles are internalized in the software, with the aim of asking questions that students can't handle alone.
The children are taken care of by foster families for many reasons, such as contempt, ill-treatment or even extortion.
No children should grow up in an environment of lack of care, care and education, but these children are going through this.
We believe the foster care system is a safe haven for these kids.
Our foster care system will provide safe home, loving care, stable education and reliable medical care.
Home care should provide them with all the needs they lack in their own home.
The Internet has been used to spread and spread among people.
The Internet's obvious features have increased its use and satisfaction.
For example, Study and Socialization are considered important players in the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) confirmed that \"personal participation\" and \"survivor\" were a new motive when they studied users' reactions to the site.
The use of the video has led to a significant discovery of the micro- and face-to-face events immediately passing through the reading of the video.
In particular, it is claimed that a precise interpretation of the appearances is possible to detect the fact that a person is lying.
Oliver Sax, in his article President's speech, stated that even those who are unable to understand the content of the speech because of the brain damage, they are still able to judge the truth of the speaker with certainty.
He even argued that animals such as dogs might have the same ability to read human behavior.
The 20th-century study shows that genetic differences are twofold: privacy and visibility.
The transition adds new genetic differences and selects to remove prominent differences in the gene pool.
The apartheid and redefinitions are reversing in the genes of each generation.
On the rare grasslands, the phytoplankton (equivalent to human beings) is difficult to fetch from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure can bring severe consequences: poor growth, poor nutrition, and even death.
The most readily available plant resources are proteins drawn from leaves or beans, but if these plants do not cook, it will not be possible for us to digest them.
On the contrary, animal food (ape, white ant, eggs) is not only vulnerable to digestion, but also provides a large amount of proteins containing all essential amino acid.
After considering all this, our ancestors will not be surprised to find that the protein problem has been solved by a similar method used by the chimpanzees on the rare grasslands today.
In a short period of time (10 to 60 minutes) the break in sleep is deliberately awakened during normal sleep.
It's easy to wake you up with the quiet alarm.
If you reset the alarm in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, force yourself to get up and turn it off.
Other biological-proposed options include the use of large amounts of liquids (in particular known as urinary water or tea) before bed, which makes it forced to get up and pee.
The calmness that one has in the body and the emotional tension that one has in his body is counterproductive.
The more we act, the more we act, the more we get to the point of being able to find peace and understanding.
The only thing that prevents us from moving forward is our own tension and frustration.
The Buddha (titled as Buddha's Buddhism) is a Buddhist religion, but it is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it is based on the love of the Great Buddha, and is based on many skills that originated in India and can be spread throughout the world.
The Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It includes Kundaliniaga, the road to hope and love.
Quindari-Yumea, respiratory practice, the Vatican and the Vulnerability wake up Kundari energy.
The heart of Tibet is at the centre of the sense of self-precision, the clean energy channel, the pulse, and the mind-to-hearing.
Germany is a common enemy of the Second World War, which prompts cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. Following the end of the war, the two countries are in a system, the way and the culture are in conflict.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies are now enemies and the cold war is officially over.
It will continue for the next 40 years and will engage its armed forces in a real war in Africa, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other parts of the world.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defense had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat along the Romanian Bridge and re-organize.
However, these plans were almost one night, when over 8 million soldiers from the Soviet Army broke the Riga Peace Agreement, the Soviet Union's non-intrusive treaty, and other two-sided international agreements, invaded the eastern part of Poland, entering and establishing the front lines of the White Russia and Ukraine.
The use of shipping is the most effective way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The Navy's traditional duty is to ensure that your country is capable of transporting its citizens and goods, while at the same time bothering your enemy's ability to transport his nationals and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples is the North Atlantic war in the Second World War.
In the meantime, the German Navy has been using U Boats to try to stop the traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany could have conquered the United Kingdom, just as they had conquered other European countries before.
The goats seem to have been raised for the first time in the Zagros mountain range in Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes have begun to feed them to facilitate access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
They usually grow up in mountains or in other pastures, usually in the care of shepherds or shepherds, who are children or adolescents, similar to those we know more about. These rangers are still being used today.
England built it in the 16th century.
Although the roadways were made only by parallel boards, they were able to move the horses faster and more heavy goods than the road at which they were slightly smaller.
As early as the early hours of the hibernation track, people found that adding a small iron to the surface of the track was more effective.
This is a common practice, but iron will cause a lot of damage to the wheel of the van.
The wheel was finally replaced by the wheel. For the first time in 177, it was introduced to the whole track.
The earliest known means of transportation are walking, and as the straight man shows, humans start walking straight before two million years ago.
Their former Southern ants have no studies straight ahead.
420 to 390 years ago, the Southern colonized ants found a specialization of both animals, but Chadh may have walked with their legs long before 7 million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally, and we can participate in the environmental movement, even as a eccentric, and to some extent reduce the harm to the future.
But if we don't just solve the problem in time, we should find the root causes of the problem and create the root causes of the problem.
Clearly, the world has changed completely in the light of human technology and technology.
After the adoption of the Act on July 4, Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Tomson were sent to the John Dunrap Printing Plant, a town of several blocks.
The whole night, 150 to 200 copies, now known as \"Durrap single print.\"
This document was published for the first time in July in the front yard of the independent memorial, John Nixon.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to him on July 9th to his team in New York. A copy was sent to London on August 10th.
The original handwritten version of the document does not exist.

The rhythms observed on many physical and behavioral occasions usually depend primarily on the existence of the internal cyclists and their work through the physiological clock.
A weekly rhythm does not respond only to external weekly sexual notes and is recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The physiological clock is self-sustaining, and there is still time for free running weekends, even without any hints.
Hersey and Chase are one of the important proposals for DNA to be inherited.
Hersey and Chase use bacteria or viruses to plant their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two tests, one DNA from the radiation phosphorus, and the other the protein from the radioactive sulphur.
The different types are determined by the importance of the genetic properties of the affected cells, and whether they are reproductive cells, which can have a wide range of different effects.
Only changes in reproductive cells can be inherited to children, while other alterations may lead to the death or cancer of cells.
Nature-based tourism can enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and plants, and have a great attraction to the people of nature who love them.

As a result of the social activity and the use of the traffic system, almost everyone has filed a complaint against the traffic system.
You seldom hear similar complaints about water or bridges in the country.
Why does the traffic system give rise to complaints? Why does it fail every day? Is the traffic engineer so ineffective or because there are some more fundamental problems?
The traffic flow is a study of moving between other drivers and vehicles at two points and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, traffic flows are not easy because we can't predict 100 percent of the drivers' behavior.
Fortunately, the driver's behavior is in a sense of reasonable stability; therefore, traffic flows are accompanied by some reasonable consistency and can be expressed in a mathematical manner.
In order to better illustrate traffic flows, three main features have been established: (i) flow, (ii) density and (iii) speed.
These relationships help to plan, design and operate roads.
Insects are the first animals flying in the sky whose ability to fly helps them avoid the enemy more easily, while they are more effective in finding food and spouses.

Humans are well known for their basic chemical elements, such as silver, silver and copper, which can be discovered in nature and are relatively easy to generate with their raw tools.
Philosopher Aristotle suggests that all things are mixed by one or more of four elements. Those four elements are clay, water, air and fire.
But his theory also points out that the different forms of these elements will transform into new matters that form things that we see in our eyes.
And don't forget that there are many other elements on the weekly schedule.
There are other metals, such as silver and gold.
There are also small non-metallic elements, such as carbon.

The Moon's surface is made of stones and dust.
It's about 70 kilometers, 100 kilometers on its back.
The surfaces under the moon are tougher; the earth is thicker.
Because the earth is tougher, it's likely that the sea will rise more than a month, making it easier for the rocks to rise.
The theory focuses on finding why humans do something or how they're interested in it.
These theories suggest that there are some needs and/or ambitions in the process of growing up.

Two well-known content theory is that the demand theory of Maslo and the two factors of Hetsberg.
In general, when managers start taking the lead in their former colleagues, there may be two kinds of behaviour.
The managers of this type are taking unwelcome decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility and holding accountable.
On the other hand, the manager becomes a completely different person, and he or she will think it must change everything that happens in the team and be responsible for it all.
After all, leaders must ultimately be responsible for the success of the team.
This behavior sometimes leads to differences between leaders and other members of the team.
The virtual team must follow the same standards of excellence as the traditional team, but there is still a slight difference between the two.
A virtual team member usually serves as a contact point for their immediate team.
As their teams meet in different regions of time and management levels or are not understood, they are often more autonomous than members of traditional teams.
The existence of the true Invisible Team (Larson and Rafael, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of the virtual team.
The Invisible Team is the management team that reports to each of its members. The Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.

The spread of new technologies has enabled us to observe and study the brain structure and processes that we have not seen before.
It's a lot of information and material, so let's go and create a model that helps us understand the work of the brain.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong scientific fiction, artificial intelligence is still a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behaviour of the machine, the ability to learn and understand.
The study of artificial intelligence involves the automaticization of the task of intelligent action.
Examples include controls, plans and tasks, the ability to answer clients' questions and questions, and handwritten identification, voice and face.

The online magazine can also raise students' ability to write and write, and students usually have an interest in spelling and spelling errors at first writing, and the presence of readers can change that.
Since students are usually the most popular audience, online authors are beginning to work to improve writing so as not to be criticized.
In addition, online journals have raised students' understanding of the environment around them... the need to satisfy the interests of readers to become smarter and more interesting (Tototo, 2004).
The online magazine is a tool to generate collaboration and encourage students to expand their studies outside of traditional school days.
The appropriate use of web sites, enhanced student analytical capacities and critical thinking; and through the material that responds to the Internet, students can define their position on the basis of others' literature and outline their views on specific topics. (Olavek, 2002).
