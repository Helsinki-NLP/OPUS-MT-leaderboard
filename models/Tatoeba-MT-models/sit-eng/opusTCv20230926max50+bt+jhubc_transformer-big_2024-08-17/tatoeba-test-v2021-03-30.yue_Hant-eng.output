You're the one who made you?
Please write in English.
He's got an answer.
Is that your bag?
I wish you a dream.
What's your full name?
You said you had a contract.
I didn't make the mother.

Don't be surprised!
>>cmn_Hant<< He attended night school.
I'll close my glasses.
That's not expensive.

I'm starving.
>>cmn_Hant<< A person can't help one person, but a group of people help one person.

How old is Tony?
>>cmn_Hant<< A cup into the face of squid milk.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom is unaware of Mary's knowledge of French.

My sister would go to bed every morning.
Can I talk to you two?
Tom's my brother.

I don't even call it a name.
Look at you!
>>cmn_Hant<< "What time is it?" "3:00."

I've always respected you.
If I win tennis, it might not be hard.
>>cmn_Hant<< I don't know when I got there first.
