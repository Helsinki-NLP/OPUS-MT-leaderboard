I saw a book.
I'm lucky today.

It's a beautiful painting.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is about 10 minutes drive from here.
>>cmn_Hant<< It's almost time for dinner.
>>cmn_Hant<< Actually it's not that difficult.
It's a good question.

That's just your imagination.
It's too late.
>>cmn_Hant<< It may rain all weekend.
It's almost three.
>>cmn_Hant<< Trying to convince her she was useless.
It's hard to understand.
Not mine.
>>cmn_Hant<< With fingers someone else is rude.
It's snowing.
Looks like he's going to Kashmir.
There it is.
>>cmn_Hant<< It may be possible to expand the computer work to the banking industry, accounting business, and so on.

He knew it a long time ago.
>>cmn_Hant<< The man who bought the ball yesterday was high.
>>cmn_Hant<< By then, I found myself wrong.
>>cmn_Hant<< Not until then I was really scared.
>>cmn_Hant<< It's raining when we get there.
It's dark.
>>cmn_Hant<< He first came to Japan ten years ago.
It's too hard for me.
>>cmn_Hant<< It was very hot this afternoon.
You're wrong.
The weather will be fine this afternoon.
Spring is coming.
>>cmn_Hant<< You go by taxi and walk without any difference.
>>cmn_Hant<< It will make you think about things you think about in your mind.
>>cmn_Hant<< We'll soon know the truth about things.
