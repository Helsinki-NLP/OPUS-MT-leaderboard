Tomorrow's bad, not sunny, it's snowy.
What was yesterday?
I can't wait for you.
You're the one who suggested us to travel together.
This is a phone call from Mr. Nakamura in Osaka. Do you want to pay?
>>cmn_Hant<< He has a great influence in the business.
>>cmn_Hant<< The British respected the order and order.
>>cmn_Hant<< I saw him swim through the river.
I forgot to call him today.
I'll take a step.
>>cmn_Hant<< She was very happy with the gift I sent.
>>cmn_Hant<< I want to sink into the sea and disappear in this world, so no one will see me again.
He's my brother's friend.
I'll make you a man.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom probably knows how to go to Mary's house.
Nick doesn't need to come to my office.
He's got a good appetite.
>>cmn_Hant<< The company has 500 employees.
>>cmn_Hant<< The book is very practical and the price is also affordable.
She's sitting in a chair.
Do you know who killed them?
Please remember!
>>cmn_Hant<< I promise to bring this tape back in a week.
>>cmn_Hant<< I feel you'll be a great lawyer.
>>cmn_Hant<< People often speak Japanese hard to learn.
>>cmn_Hant<< Traffic in the city centre is blocked.
The police caught the thief's arm.
>>cmn_Hant<< He almost got hit by a car.
She'll be here tonight.
I want to see the disease.
That will put you in danger.
>>cmn_Hant<< Three plus three equals six.
I wish Tom would agree.
I grew up in the mountains.
This photo is beautiful!
I don't understand what he wants.
I don't want to leave this afternoon.
You ski better than me.
We're in a hurry.
>>cmn_Hant<< Our school was founded in 1990.
I just want to rest.
>>cmn_Hant<< They gave him up for failure.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom didn't appear again.
>>cmn_Hant<< To protect ourselves, we have to lie.
>>cmn_Hant<< He drove on a side of the radio to listen to music.
What room do you want to order?
You're beautiful.
Did you do your homework yourself?
We need help.
Milk is a girl.
He's much higher than you.
>>cmn_Hant<< I'm sure they can hear our voices.
>>cmn_Hant<< There is no comment yet.
I don't love her.
>>cmn_Hant<< You better take your elbow today.
>>cmn_Hant<< This is the best book I've read.
>>cmn_Hant<< He used to get up early.
>>cmn_Hant<< She always spoke low.
Where are your anklets?
I know, you're busy too.
I'm sorry, I missed your letter.
Is it big?
There's a butterfly in the kitchen.
I didn't read yesterday.
Your luggage is overweight.
Just do it anyway.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom wrote a letter to Mary this morning.
>>cmn_Hant<< Turn the fire slightly.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom was born on May 5, 2015.
>>cmn_Hant<< Carlo returns to her hotel.
I'm sorry, I don't smoke.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom doesn't eat meat, Mary.
>>cmn_Hant<< He's out of control after drinking.
I know everything.
Good morning, everybody.
I got to the station this morning.
>>cmn_Hant<< I think I'm a little burning.
Hello Tom, when did you get here?
Let Bob cook.
I suddenly couldn't remember her name.
It's a circus!
I heard him out.
Tom told me I should do it.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom is afraid of everyone.
Life will continue.
>>cmn_Hant<< In Taiwan, the changes in the season are becoming less apparent. Short spring and short fall gradually became a characteristic of the four seasons.
>>cmn_Hant<< Kate's face looks so bad, must be sick.
It's snowing.
You can go.
>>cmn_Hant<< These flowers can be seen around Hokkaido.
Does he look like a doctor?
>>cmn_Hant<< Los Angeles is one of the places I want to go.
>>cmn_Hant<< It will make you think about things you think about in your mind.
>>cmn_Hant<< I heard it from the radio.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom may be a vegetarian.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom probably didn't know why the picnic was cancelled.
I don't want to.
I trust you.
I just finished my job.
>>cmn_Hant<< He plays piano, she sings.
He lied to us.
It's a very traditional ritual.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom is crying out now.
How many people can do that?
You're gonna pick up the phone.
>>cmn_Hant<< The weather is hot.
He fixed my watch.
You have to move.
I read last night.
>>cmn_Hant<< Apart from Sunday I work every day.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mayuko designed her own clothes.
>>cmn_Hant<< With fingers someone else is rude.
I hope she quit smoking.
I'm a dream.
Do you have a gift shop here?
Luke, I'm your cousin.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom broke up with Southwestern last month.
>>cmn_Hant<< He posted a piece of tape on his hand.
I have so many clothes, so I don't know what tomorrow's wearing.
If you were me, what would you do?
>>cmn_Hant<< One of my friends came to see me during the day.
>>cmn_Hant<< He asked me who painted it.
Would you like another cake?
>>cmn_Hant<< He calls her every night.
Can you do me a favor?
He doesn't want to do anything.
>>cmn_Hant<< All you have to do is take a good chance to grasp this difficult situation.
>>cmn_Hant<< Brian is holding Kate's hand.
>>cmn_Hant<< The hot weather makes us faint.
>>cmn_Hant<< The debate is as silver, silent as gold.
You have to wait.
Life is wonderful!
I cried all night.
I'm starving!
Who are we?
Why don't you get married?
>>cmn_Hant<< Will you teach me how to play guitar?
Were you happy at the party last night?
I don't understand what he means.
Time to go.
Call me tomorrow at 6 a.m.
I want a seat on the first floor.
>>cmn_Hant<< He keeps the words of this speed-temperature practice right now, and the qualifications are absolutely no problem.
>>cmn_Hant<< He knows a lot of foreign affairs.
Tom was good to me.
The world population has an average growth of 2% per year.
Tom doesn't seem to be Canadian.
>>cmn_Hant<< He made a bookcase for her.
Do you have anything to report?
>>cmn_Hant<< Choose the ball you like.
>>cmn_Hant<< Who are the boys swimming there?
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom is now in the health room.
I'm in Rome now.
>>cmn_Hant<< I think it's time to buy a house.
Oh, shit!
Please give me the wine.
>>cmn_Hant<< He's completely from kindness.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom just returned from the post office.
>>cmn_Hant<< She cooked a great meal for us.
>>cmn_Hant<< Don't be afraid, so he won't think you took anything illegal and then flip the box to check for erroneous time.
I don't understand his jokes.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was wounded in the accident.
You have to answer these questions.
>>cmn_Hant<< She gets this ticket free of charge.
I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to monkeys.
I don't want to go to Boston.
Can I go to the bathroom?
What happened to your dog?
If I were you, I wouldn't do that.
I work every day except Sunday.
>>cmn_Hant<< There is no doubt that people initially worship are the most common, closely related to people's lives, such as horses, sheep, chickens, dogs, and so on.
>>cmn_Hant<< He sometimes cooked dinner for us.
I feed a dog every day.
>>cmn_Hant<< Last month they climbed Mount Fuji.
Tom doesn't talk to anyone.
Don't forget to take skate shoes.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom's books are much more than Mary's.
>>cmn_Hant<< Her favorite dress is no longer fit, so her mother has to recreate one for her.
God created the heavens.
Can you give me your phone number?
We like to watch TV.
If you have time, please come and play.
I'm playing baseball.
Please send me a letter.
We talked until dawn.
>>cmn_Hant<< Her only fun was to listen to music.
Go straight home.
>>cmn_Hant<< The two old men wear cards for time.
We recommend increasing fees.
I'm not here tomorrow.
I need some stamps.
Thank you very much for your help.
>>cmn_Hant<< For teachers, it was fun to teach her.
Does she know your phone number?
>>cmn_Hant<< When I saw them in a date, I asked them, "Did I hear the wedding bells?"
>>cmn_Hant<< His novel will be published next month.
>>cmn_Hant<< He first came to Japan ten years ago.
>>cmn_Hant<< Everyone thought the West Garden temple would win the duel, but he lost.
Stop it!
>>cmn_Hant<< There's a trace on the table.
>>cmn_Hant<< My friend was vegetarian, but I didn't tell him there was meat in soup.
>>cmn_Hant<< All the furniture was filled with dust.
They won't tell us anything.
I accidentally found it.
I saw him wash the car.
>>cmn_Hant<< She often goes to school late.
>>cmn_Hant<< Saudi Arabia has very rich oil.
She loves children.
>>cmn_Hant<< I don't want to sleep, so I'm still reading books.
>>cmn_Hant<< I usually ride a bicycle to go to school.
>>cmn_Hant<< We asked for a flower play piano.
I'm wearing my pajamas for breakfast.
I have some friends.
>>cmn_Hant<< John should be here anytime.
I went too.
I can't find my pen.
I brought you a surprise.
>>cmn_Hant<< My plan failed one by one.
I like sports.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom died three months ago.
>>cmn_Hant<< Please correct the line word.
>>cmn_Hant<< She rubbed the walls into white.
Are you busy working?
Are you in Lucy's house tomorrow morning?
I think it's near here.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom took out the money pack and paid the bill.
>>cmn_Hant<< He's a coward.
I can't forget her.
>>cmn_Hant<< I sleep late than usual.
>>cmn_Hant<< We don't know which train they'll take.
>>cmn_Hant<< They sat in the park's long chair and talked.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is always hard to meet parents' expectations.
>>cmn_Hant<< Does anyone else understand what you speak French?
>>cmn_Hant<< Jane didn't go to school today.
>>cmn_Hant<< Don't let anyone enter this room.
Grab the rope.
>>cmn_Hant<< I am interested in Japanese history.
>>cmn_Hant<< He is now in this age and has already won in international competitions, and the future is in infinite limits.
It's cold today.
Tom and I are done.
What are you doing there?
I promise I'll put you in jail.
I can't accept this plan.
We were in London last winter.
>>cmn_Hant<< I tried, but I didn't succeed.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was forced to sign on the document.
>>cmn_Hant<< Cross-country businesses are far superior to traditional single-country businesses.
>>cmn_Hant<< He promised to come, but did not.
I'm not used to this treatment.
>>cmn_Hant<< Winding can be dangerous.
I'm cold.
Tom lost his job.
Please believe me.
>>cmn_Hant<< He'll arrive at the embassy tonight.
>>cmn_Hant<< I think everyone should learn another language.
>>cmn_Hant<< John doesn't know what to do next.
Is there a doctor on the ship?
>>cmn_Hant<< Who cares when she gets married?
My father loved pizza.
Don't get out of the rain.
That's not fair.
>>cmn_Hant<< There was a dwarf who lived in the forest before.
"Is he going to be successful?" he asked.
>>cmn_Hant<< The wedding will take place in a 17th century church.
>>cmn_Hant<< He attended the Photographic Society.
My father is retiring next spring.
>>cmn_Hant<< My hair is longer than Jane.
I have a dictionary.
Everyone can find his other half.
>>cmn_Hant<< The fire burned the whole town into ashes.
My sister is shorter than you.
>>cmn_Hant<< His father died, so he was sad.
It's raining.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mr. Smith wouldn't speak English, would he?
>>cmn_Hant<< She plays tennis every Sunday.
>>cmn_Hant<< Seven nights often appear in comics, so I also understand what it means.
>>cmn_Hant<< Her name is Anna, Anna and Louis as colleagues.
>>cmn_Hant<< Stop the car here illegally.
That's cute!
>>cmn_Hant<< "I want to play cards." "I am too."
>>cmn_Hant<< Jean and Kate are twins.
>>cmn_Hant<< He currently works in Turkey.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom doesn't know how to express himself.
>>cmn_Hant<< A great empire, like a big cake, the easiest place to disappear is on the edge.
I don't work tomorrow.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although the gorillas don't know how to speak, they can communicate with humans in other ways.
>>cmn_Hant<< To be honest, I really want to stay home and don't want to go out.
>>cmn_Hant<< An old man rests under a tree.
Today is Monday.
>>cmn_Hant<< To see all the light has ruined me.
>>cmn_Hant<< I pull myself up.
It's a beautiful place.
I hope you stay here for a while.
I don't have class today.
>>cmn_Hant<< You can't make everyone happy because not everyone is human.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom and Mary studied together in the library.
I'm hungry!
>>cmn_Hant<< He said in his will to leave all his property to his wife.
>>cmn_Hant<< I don't believe she would speak Hebrew.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was heavy on his shoulder.
Until next week.
I agree.
>>cmn_Hant<< The bus will move in five minutes.
>>cmn_Hant<< I've probably seen this movie before, but I don't remember it.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom repaired his own bicycle.
>>cmn_Hant<< Did you tell Tom your question?
>>cmn_Hant<< After the business was discontinued, many public bathhouses had added new equipment such as sauna, fitness equipment and other equipment, hoping to attract more people to the light.
>>cmn_Hant<< AI represents artificial intelligence.
I don't live with him anymore.
>>cmn_Hant<< You don't like raw fish chips, do you?
>>cmn_Hant<< Writing a love letter in English is not easy.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom donated a lot of money to this hospital.
>>cmn_Hant<< Always be honest with yourself.
They're not dead.
>>cmn_Hant<< This little girl let the bird escape.
>>cmn_Hant<< First, I want you to come with me to the department store.
I can go too.
>>cmn_Hant<< Seeds are wind, and harvests are cyclones.
Eat fruit.
>>cmn_Hant<< George was sad.
>>cmn_Hant<< Their homes were destroyed by strong earthquakes.
>>cmn_Hant<< There's only one way left now.
>>cmn_Hant<< If I get there early, I'll meet Kelly.
>>cmn_Hant<< I have nothing to do during my vacation.
>>cmn_Hant<< The concert is about to begin.
>>cmn_Hant<< A fool shoots the arrow at once.
I wish you good healing early!
>>cmn_Hant<< I have a father who is a magician's friend.
No need to come to my house.
>>cmn_Hant<< The driver does not need to be responsible for this traffic accident.
>>cmn_Hant<< Football is more popular than tennis.
I raised a cat and a dog. The cat was black and the dog was white.
Happy Mother's Day!
He stole her watch.
>>cmn_Hant<< Everything is in the way.
>>cmn_Hant<< Both girls have a pair of blue eyes.
They look like they're crying.
I'll tell him the truth.
Choose what you like.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mother forgives his mistakes.
I think my right arm broke.
Please give me a blanket.
I'm worried about my weight.
How do you know that?
I look forward to receiving your letter soon.
>>cmn_Hant<< The house is filled with five colorful artworks.
>>cmn_Hant<< This meal made him hungry.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom doesn't understand why his wife left him.
>>cmn_Hant<< Health paper is done.
Single room or double room?
>>cmn_Hant<< There will be signs before things happen.
>>cmn_Hant<< The thief crawls through the back door into the house.
>>cmn_Hant<< Love.
>>cmn_Hant<< She exercises the piano every day.
>>cmn_Hant<< Maria doesn't like talking in public.
>>cmn_Hant<< The network is slow.
What is that?
>>cmn_Hant<< The joke to open up your boss at the public is pointless.
>>cmn_Hant<< Welcome to questions anytime.
She intentionally broke the window.
She needs our help.
Hard work!
>>cmn_Hant<< After winning the Nobel Prize, she is still bluffed.
>>cmn_Hant<< I know a good lawyer who can help you.
You want to be beautiful!
Do you often eat fish?
I just ate sushi and drank beer.
>>cmn_Hant<< I don't like teachers who don't ask questions.
We got her in the park.
>>cmn_Hant<< We can transport it tonight.
You're on the plane.
Let me handle it.
She's in the bathroom.
I'm not high.
>>cmn_Hant<< Helen is playing in the yard.
>>cmn_Hant<< He is a professor of English at Leeds University.
Isn't she Anna?
You're right.
That's his car.

>>cmn_Hant<< He set the law to go home before dark.
>>cmn_Hant<< When I was in high school, I woke up at 6:00 a.m.
>>cmn_Hant<< He's dated time.
>>cmn_Hant<< Zozo Mujo died on October 25, 1955.
>>cmn_Hant<< Lemon is acidic.
>>cmn_Hant<< I heard a crowd out of the station called my name.
You don't have to rush.
>>cmn_Hant<< Should I register this class?
>>cmn_Hant<< What's going on is happening, and you're not going to shake your head.
I'm looking for your boss.
I have a lot of pictures.
I met her at night.
Are they already here?
How about a movie?
We're driving.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tatoeba: A place where all quotes go to die.
She gave me this disc.
>>cmn_Hant<< Because of a scholarship, Tom earned more than one university.
Kids play in the park.
Are you Japanese?
I've been through the night again.
Carefully slide!
>>cmn_Hant<< Although failed many times, he never gave up.
>>cmn_Hant<< This issue will be discussed next meeting.
>>cmn_Hant<< If you want to stay late, you'll start saving now.
>>cmn_Hant<< How do you know your girlfriend doesn't pretend to orgasm?
>>cmn_Hant<< They are proud to talk about good grades in the exam, and this pride is understandable.
>>cmn_Hant<< Get his help, my job is now well.
>>cmn_Hant<< Have you ever had sex with her?
>>cmn_Hant<< This is the best pizza I've ever eaten.
What's the number today?
They're very happy...
>>cmn_Hant<< You're out of the country and you'll know how small Japan is.
>>cmn_Hant<< There was no radio in Japan at that time.
"He's lost!" he shouted.
I let him brush the house.
I've been with her for months.
How did you finish it?
I have to vote for Tom.
I thought of a good idea.
He spent the night with his uncle.
>>cmn_Hant<< She says she's rather beautiful than saying she's cute.
>>cmn_Hant<< The little boy wears glasses.
We ran three miles.
>>cmn_Hant<< The community is quiet.
I'll take you to this town.
What do you mean summer vacation?
>>cmn_Hant<< Ken paints his bicycle into white.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was awakened by the knocking door.
It's an old city.
He ate a box of chocolate.
I want another one.
Your writing has some errors.
Why did you say such things?
He must have had a drink last night.
>>cmn_Hant<< "That's not anymore," I replied.
Where did you put my luggage?
>>cmn_Hant<< Continue to discuss and there will be no results.
How long have you lived there?
I'll go to the park.
>>cmn_Hant<< I think English is simple.
>>cmn_Hant<< This is where the Battle of Hastings occurred.
>>cmn_Hant<< Wild animals live in the forest.
I don't think he can help you.
>>cmn_Hant<< They dream of losing the game.
>>cmn_Hant<< She quickly opened the letter.
What kind of sandwich do you want?
I'll get you the ring back.
Please don't knock in.
>>cmn_Hant<< Don't hide your lights under the turret.
I went there yesterday.
>>cmn_Hant<< The next day was Tom's birthday.
>>cmn_Hant<< You should try harder to learn English.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was born in Nagasaki.
She approved my program.
Her sister also sings beautiful.
>>cmn_Hant<< Since she went to London, no more calls.
>>cmn_Hant<< Suddenly, three dogs appear in front of us.
>>cmn_Hant<< We suddenly heard a shot outside.
I hope he'll wait for me.
They invited me to play cards.
Let's go swimming in the river.
Can you move that chair?
>>cmn_Hant<< Would you speak Na American?
>>cmn_Hant<< Sick is boring.
We're going to have dinner soon.
>>cmn_Hant<< Both spellings are right.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten anything?
Your English is very good.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was welcomed by the students.
He's totally wrong.
Bob is my friend.
>>cmn_Hant<< She usually sleeps eight hours.
Isn't that black?
>>cmn_Hant<< They did a series of concerts.
Please tell me your name and phone number.
>>cmn_Hant<< James had a storm.
I was forced to take drugs.
>>cmn_Hant<< The old house was demolished to give the super market space to the super market.
Tom's running away.
>>cmn_Hant<< The meeting will take place tomorrow.
Do you speak English?
We'll leave early tomorrow.
I don't have a bike.
>>cmn_Hant<< Confirm order.
>>cmn_Hant<< Our store is full across the country.
>>cmn_Hant<< I'm reading a book now.
>>cmn_Hant<< I don't like the smell of this fruit.
You need to help your friends.
>>cmn_Hant<< FSI Staff: "Sir, there's a website that anyone can add a sentence of foreign language!". president of FSI: "What? Blow them!".
>>cmn_Hant<< The doctor continues to observe the patient's movements.
>>cmn_Hant<< I walked into the cafe room and saw two young people watching wrestling on television.
>>cmn_Hant<< He told me his grandfather was 90 years old.
>>cmn_Hant<< Want to go out and breathe fresh air?
>>cmn_Hant<< He is a writer, or a politician.
Where are you going tomorrow?
This is for you.
>>cmn_Hant<< There is no idiotic security system.
It was a beautiful moment.
It's really a good weather.
How fast does Tom work?
Where's your dad?
I'm going to see my uncle tomorrow.
>>cmn_Hant<< That's not a horse, it's a mule.
What did you eat?
They came here yesterday.
His father was in the garden.
Sorry, but where is the library?
You're kidding me!
>>cmn_Hant<< I can't wait to see a new version of Tatoeba.
>>cmn_Hant<< He put things down and left.
>>cmn_Hant<< After the clear window, I can see clearly from the window.
>>cmn_Hant<< The school is 5 km away from my home.
I don't want to see you again!
I collect stamps.
It's a heartbreaking story.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom and Mary will follow me.
My grandfather died five years ago.
I'll watch you.
Don't think about it.
Tom doesn't want to stay.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom said he'd let Mary do it.
>>cmn_Hant<< You speak loud to me at the first floor.
>>cmn_Hant<< To be honest, I really want to stay home and don't want to go out.
>>cmn_Hant<< "&amp; "This symbol means 'and'.
>>cmn_Hant<< He also speaks Russian.
>>cmn_Hant<< Humans are part of nature.
>>cmn_Hant<< Are you a student of this school?
Nature is generous.
They all laughed together.
Have you ever been married?
>>cmn_Hant<< Yes, I have a student certificate.
I ate Tom's sandwich.
Your cake is delicious.
Please look at my suitcase.
>>cmn_Hant<< Jane seems to like this party.
>>cmn_Hant<< He may have left Kyoto.
Today is June 8th, my wife's birthday.
>>cmn_Hant<< He wakes up at 6:30 a.m. on school days.
Did Tom say anything?
They changed the system.
>>cmn_Hant<< The taste of wine is affected by the weather.
Have you had breakfast this morning?
It's impossible to do it.
He lives inside the apple.
Muriel is an Indian.
>>cmn_Hant<< My brother has lived in London for many years.
Got it.
I believe he's a capable man.
I don't want milk.
>>cmn_Hant<< This drug is for external use only.
George, how long have you lived here?
"Don't cry," she said.
>>cmn_Hant<< I caught his arm before he fell down.
>>cmn_Hant<< The more cheese, the more the hole the cheese. So the less the cheese.
>>cmn_Hant<< He taught English to his friends.
You can have lunch in this room.
>>cmn_Hant<< This girl made a hard bow to use.
>>cmn_Hant<< Nancy is from London.
I'm glad to see you here.
I'm hungry.
This dentist is too expensive.
They're both drunk.
>>cmn_Hant<< At Tatoeba, you must always listen to senior members. They will tell you what you can't do and why. Then you do it.
I want a cold drink.
>>cmn_Hant<< I suddenly thought he might be a commercial spy.
Should we have lunch?
>>cmn_Hant<< She was full of apples in her bag.
I'm familiar with your face.
>>cmn_Hant<< Don't run away, I want you to answer my question.
>>cmn_Hant<< The soldier kept his guard in the dark.
Who will believe you?
Where do you want to go next?
She's been dead for ten years.
Mom took me to the park.
>>cmn_Hant<< Are there many trees in the park?
>>cmn_Hant<< Who is that man playing piano?
We have to consider it.
>>cmn_Hant<< I've been busy since last Sunday.
He told me to slow down.
Please take my dry cleaning clothes.
She doesn't have beauty.
She asked him to send that letter.
>>cmn_Hant<< He came back from Sydney today.
I'm doing really well.
>>cmn_Hant<< She was with him.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mike is coming to dinner tonight.
>>cmn_Hant<< Can you describe the situation at the time?
>>cmn_Hant<< The center of this novel is the North-South War.
>>cmn_Hant<< She wears a pair of white silk socks.
She helped me pack my suitcase.
If I have time, I'll come.
I should bring my camera.
>>cmn_Hant<< Bill in Japan.
What kind of eggs do you want?
>>cmn_Hant<< Would you speak simple English?
>>cmn_Hant<< To the head, we remember not the words of the enemy, but the silence of friends.

I met Mary yesterday.
>>cmn_Hant<< I bought a camera a few days ago.
I can't hear what you're saying.
>>cmn_Hant<< Why do you need this money?
>>cmn_Hant<< Bill is late as usual.
>>cmn_Hant<< The house had a fire in one place.
Meet me there.
I ate half the sandwich.
How long have you lived in Japan?
It's lovely.
>>cmn_Hant<< Did Tom help his mother yesterday?
I hope to see you again.
>>cmn_Hant<< I feel very upset every Monday.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom ran fast.
>>cmn_Hant<< I'll take that theme in five minutes.
Do you know this is a problem?
He knows how to play baseball.
That's all I can find.
>>cmn_Hant<< The boy is there.
What's your name?
>>cmn_Hant<< Birds don't fly in the air.
I suck my child's breast.
>>cmn_Hant<< The rain doesn't allow us to walk.
>>cmn_Hant<< He's allergic to dust in the room.
What is my job?
>>cmn_Hant<< Mars has two natural satellites.
Can I get more coffee?
>>cmn_Hant<< A word is both said, and the horses are hard to follow.
>>cmn_Hant<< Please, eat some fruit.
It's only her.
You can rely on it.
I can't do it without her help.
>>cmn_Hant<< Will you drive me home?
Especially be patient.
>>cmn_Hant<< Bob wrote me a letter every month.
>>cmn_Hant<< I helped him so much, but he didn't even give thanks.
>>cmn_Hant<< She is engaged to a rich man.
>>cmn_Hant<< This shirt doesn't have that collar.
I can understand you.
I have to go.
>>cmn_Hant<< She wears a white suit.
It's over!
That's bullshit.
I don't have any money.
She was sick yesterday.
>>cmn_Hant<< Once the outbreak of nuclear war, suffering will be all human.
>>cmn_Hant<< The book is a new book.
Now you have the ball.
>>cmn_Hant<< To me, French is much simpler than English.
She's taking a bath for the baby.
Be careful not to get cold.
>>cmn_Hant<< We saw a lot of ships in the port.
I'll wash myself every morning.
>>cmn_Hant<< You should learn to control your emotions.
I want to rent a car.
I've been warned not to go there.
I'm cold.
>>cmn_Hant<< He treated me like a stranger.
>>cmn_Hant<< Apples are used as desserts.
>>cmn_Hant<< Everyone knows the Earth is round.
Let's go to the sea.
It's dangerous!
What's his name?
You'll fail.
>>cmn_Hant<< You made a wise choice.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was wounded in a traffic accident.
>>cmn_Hant<< If I lose my key, I can't lock the door.
>>cmn_Hant<< I like to eat grapes.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was disqualified from qualifying.
Have a glass of water.
I'm not trying to disturb you.
You can use my new car.
He's gone.
>>cmn_Hant<< Japan's culture has deeply influenced East Asia.
>>cmn_Hant<< The lyrics of the Canadian national anthem were originally written in French.
>>cmn_Hant<< I don't like to make things go unfulfilled.
Fortunately she didn't die.
This thing is valuable.
She told me to open the window.
>>cmn_Hant<< He took off the glasses.
I'm leaving.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom's name is on the list.
>>cmn_Hant<< He pressed the emergency button.
He won't listen to my advice.
I've heard her story.
10,000 yen is enough?
>>cmn_Hant<< You'll keep the promise, right?
>>cmn_Hant<< Today's western blue flowers do the head, not very good.
She blinked her eyes.
>>cmn_Hant<< On Saturday, people on Tokyo Street were suffering.
>>cmn_Hant<< Do you know who the girl is standing on the window?
Please close the door.
Unreasonable.
>>cmn_Hant<< She was embarrassed to look at the young man.
>>cmn_Hant<< I tried to change the subject.
>>cmn_Hant<< A dedicated writer has no fixed income.
Everything in this world is lost, using it until it is worn out.
>>cmn_Hant<< The soldiers blocked the way to the city.
Bring the keys.
We don't know what to do.
>>cmn_Hant<< Both of them were in the room.
>>cmn_Hant<< There's a whisky in this bottle.
>>cmn_Hant<< He walked through this house.
I'm from Colombia.
>>cmn_Hant<< Frog at the bottom of the well.
It's too late.
Who cares when she gets married?
He looks like a good boy.
He heard the noise.
But he wasn't always smiling.
>>cmn_Hant<< Whether he comes or not, I'll go.
Please go home as soon as possible.
I like to do my job.
>>cmn_Hant<< We raised a lot of eggs yesterday.
I'm wearing number 37.
>>cmn_Hant<< Hometeachers or teachers should make children enjoy reading fun.
Spring is here.
>>cmn_Hant<< There's no need to speak so loud.
>>cmn_Hant<< You're just listening, not thinking.
>>cmn_Hant<< He lost a book.
Tom is a fat man.
>>cmn_Hant<< I gave up all hope of survival.
>>cmn_Hant<< He tried to form a different group.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tatoeba: The sentence is always a sentence, unless they are not.
>>cmn_Hant<< The news spread throughout the world within hours.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was the first to come.
Please give me the menu.
My name is Jack.
What do you want to drink?
>>cmn_Hant<< We're due to storm delays.
I know she's Spanish.
I don't drink water.
I want to hear your opinion.
>>cmn_Hant<< Her socks are grey.
>>cmn_Hant<< From that point on, we haven't seen him.
>>cmn_Hant<< From this point on, you can therefore define feminism or necessary.
>>cmn_Hant<< They named Jane for their babies.
>>cmn_Hant<< Please let me try this game.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom has lost interest in learning French.
>>cmn_Hant<< We always have something to say.
How do I change my cell phone?
>>cmn_Hant<< Everything has two sides, the believer only sees one.
>>cmn_Hant<< Cold drinks are better.
>>cmn_Hant<< The United States of America declared its independence in 1776 to the Great Britain.
>>cmn_Hant<< Canada's crime rate has fallen.
Drink water.
I don't have any money. I don't know where to go.
>>cmn_Hant<< The cans are empty.
>>cmn_Hant<< He whispered, "This war, we can't lose!"
Control is everything.
>>cmn_Hant<< I speak English.
That will put you in danger.
Put your safety cap on.
I'll meet him tomorrow.
>>cmn_Hant<< They see Joe as the father of English poetry.
We're still a little suspicious.
My parents don't know.
I want to swim in this river.
>>cmn_Hant<< She forced him to do this job.
We call our dog Johnnie.
>>cmn_Hant<< Understanding a computer is an advantage.
Don't be sad.
Try it again.
>>cmn_Hant<< This requires careful consideration.
>>cmn_Hant<< John and Tom are wrestling.
Maybe it's just coincidence.
>>cmn_Hant<< That writer is writing a new book.
Did you stop coughing?
I want to send them to Japan.
>>cmn_Hant<< She died of stomach cancer.
>>cmn_Hant<< She took the subway on the silver seat.
Tom is drinking apple juice.
We think he's honest.
There's good and bad.
I go shopping every day.
I really like French food.
>>cmn_Hant<< Water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen.
Wang Wang!
She might come.
I'm fine.
>>cmn_Hant<< He used his chances as much as possible.
I can't help you.
>>cmn_Hant<< They lined up buses like them.
"Is he in the car?" he said, "No, he's in the car."
>>cmn_Hant<< How many weeks do you learn Chinese?
This is Mary's dog.
>>cmn_Hant<< Fifty steps.
She's old enough to understand.
We got out of there.
>>cmn_Hant<< Going to church to attend the week, it won't be a Christian right away, it's like standing in a car and not becoming a car.
How long do you need it?
I really want it.
Let's meet in front of the theater.
We're all hungry.
>>cmn_Hant<< The boy walked out of the window.
When do you need to go to sleep?
>>cmn_Hant<< We don't need enough water, we need clean water.
I can't walk in front. It's too dark.
I'm scared to go alone.
Let's stay here tonight.
You're so nice.
How much?
>>cmn_Hant<< Time flies.
Tom seems to have a cold.
>>cmn_Hant<< I dropped the pen on the ground.
>>cmn_Hant<< The cold air windshield swept the entire house.
>>cmn_Hant<< She had guts to say.
>>cmn_Hant<< Let us wait here until he returns.
>>cmn_Hant<< Our teacher likes his new car.
I'm thirsty.
Look, she's here!
>>cmn_Hant<< The French fought the defeat of Waterloo.
These are his stationery.
>>cmn_Hant<< She went to Italy to study music.
I'm going to have an exaggeration of milk.
>>cmn_Hant<< This is the castle's place.
>>cmn_Hant<< Very few Japanese can use English very well.
I have no problem with the boss.
Thank you for your help.
>>cmn_Hant<< This may not be a real diamond.
We expect it this year.
Why don't we have dinner?
I know what you mean.
>>cmn_Hant<< You've been good before, now it's better.
>>cmn_Hant<< I decided not to learn French.
>>cmn_Hant<< I think you should do it before you go home today.
I'm starving!
>>cmn_Hant<< From then on, he put his whole soul into his work.
>>cmn_Hant<< The three cubes are twenty-seven.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system.
I wasn't wrong with his first impression.
My house is outside the city.
>>cmn_Hant<< The universe is vast.
I can only speak for myself.
>>cmn_Hant<< He left the bus.
They smiled and said hello to me.
Look at my new car.
It's strange that he's arranged to stay at this cheap hotel.
I hope so.
Would you like another beer?
>>cmn_Hant<< He went to Austria to read music.
We shower every day.
I think your answer is right.
>>cmn_Hant<< We discussed that issue for a long time.
Don't deal with this guy.
She'll be back at 5:00.
>>cmn_Hant<< My father was too busy to walk.
He's Taro's brother.
>>cmn_Hant<< That's a rumor that's true.
Don't be afraid.
>>cmn_Hant<< He pulled me to the second floor.
I agree with you.
>>cmn_Hant<< They're all looking for this lost child.
>>cmn_Hant<< At first, he did not speak English.
I must have missed the wrong number.
All participants must register.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom lives three miles east of this place.
Someone's looking for you.
>>cmn_Hant<< He is interested in collecting insects.
How high is Mount Fuji?
>>cmn_Hant<< I want some fresh fish.
He was the doctor I mentioned last night.
>>cmn_Hant<< Fifty years ago, television, computer stuff like this was a simple night owl.
I think I'm going to the bus.
I need my coat.
>>cmn_Hant<< Relative to animal names, because our first people are closely related to these animals.
He's really good.
I'm leaving.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although Flash's content can't be displayed on the iPad, it can be seen at home as long as the URL of the web is sent to its own mailbox.
I usually shower at night.
You better wear a raincoat.
>>cmn_Hant<< It all started wrong with Tom.
Your team is stronger than us.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom said there was a gun in his house.
Worried it was useless.
>>cmn_Hant<< I went to the library twice a week, three times.
>>cmn_Hant<< He insisted on the original project.
She's dead.
Did they come in time?
Did you report it?
>>cmn_Hant<< He introduced me to his daughter.
>>cmn_Hant<< It is obvious that there are strong differences between these two.
I still live in my father's house.
He's three inches higher than me.
I don't blame you for doing that.
>>cmn_Hant<< Can you solve this problem?
>>cmn_Hant<< I haven't had time to read books lately.
>>cmn_Hant<< History of Japan is my favorite subject.
Is there a bathtub in the room?
>>cmn_Hant<< Wherever you go, I'll follow you.
>>cmn_Hant<< She made a new dress for him.
>>cmn_Hant<< As far as I know, he's a honest man.
That's none of his business.
>>cmn_Hant<< There are four seasons a year.
That was a month ago.
>>cmn_Hant<< She tied the package tightly with the rope.
Write his address.
>>cmn_Hant<< My income decreased by 10 percent.
>>cmn_Hant<< Her mother gave her a new dress.
>>cmn_Hant<< My father didn't eat a lot of fruit.
>>cmn_Hant<< He left midway in Los Angeles and Chicago.
>>cmn_Hant<< The long skirt is no longer popular.
You don't accept credit cards?
Can you take me?
I earn 100 euros a day.
>>cmn_Hant<< What you need to learn is real skills, not just knowledge of the surface.
This investment has a 6% return.
Tom wants to go to Japan.
People make mistakes, blame others for what humans do.
>>cmn_Hant<< Do you know who invented the microscope?
>>cmn_Hant<< Nothing is more angry than seeing animals being abused.
Did you hear a click?
I'll pay you back right away.
>>cmn_Hant<< I owe my success to him.
Please close the door.
>>cmn_Hant<< The trails in the mountain are full of soft leaves, very good to go.
>>cmn_Hant<< You should try harder to learn.
They don't even know why.
Would you like some more cake?
>>cmn_Hant<< It's a suit of clothes.
>>cmn_Hant<< He has a great potential.
I don't understand.
>>cmn_Hant<< He slowly drinks hot coffee.
I need a place to read.
This house is big.
I don't speak Japanese.
Let me see.
You're great.
You know who I am.
>>cmn_Hant<< I always rely on him when I'm in trouble.
That's what I want.
>>cmn_Hant<< My brother gave me a lovely doll.
He's speeding up.
I really want to write a lot of sentences in Tatoeba, but I have something else to do.
Is English more difficult than Japanese?
>>cmn_Hant<< His feet were bound by cross bound.
She's already here.
>>cmn_Hant<< Probably read this book.
He's only $100.
My name is Ricardo, and you?
Come on!
You said too much.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mike made dental checks last week.
This won't help you.
>>cmn_Hant<< She was almost late to school.
>>cmn_Hant<< Although he apologized, I was still angry.
>>cmn_Hant<< Bird eggs.
I've been swimming here every day.
>>cmn_Hant<< One day, the Summerstone was lost in London.
Don't be shy.
>>cmn_Hant<< The handcuffs are four times faster than their feet.
Look at the rain tomorrow!
>>cmn_Hant<< He's always picking people's problems.
Where's my elbow?
>>cmn_Hant<< Repairing my bike cost me a thousand yen.
He's a good man.
>>cmn_Hant<< The broccoli is a fossil fuel.
>>cmn_Hant<< I asked Southwest to stay home.
I'd love to eat the ducks.
Tom can't work anymore.
>>cmn_Hant<< I left my briefcase on the bus.
She's been in hospital for a month.
My home is only a mile away.
It's not my food.
She takes a bath every morning.
He's very straight.
>>cmn_Hant<< He can solve this problem.
She swims great.
Do you believe in God?
>>cmn_Hant<< Please put the book on the shelf.
Your reasons are good enough.
I borrowed money from my father.
>>cmn_Hant<< I opposed him to paying bills.
>>cmn_Hant<< Save in a shade.
>>cmn_Hant<< Small self-control is poor.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mike was elected president.
>>cmn_Hant<< A few days ago, something terrible happened outside Tokyo.
>>cmn_Hant<< That comedian said all the old jokes we've heard before.
I know he's busy.
>>cmn_Hant<< Don't treat people with appearance.
>>cmn_Hant<< He won the championship in chess games.
I can run faster than Ken.
>>cmn_Hant<< Mary dyes her hair into blue.
I want to go to America.
>>cmn_Hant<< Half bread is better than nothing.
You did better than me.
I'm familiar with those tall girls.
She's the woman I want.
Maybe I should tell Tom the truth.
>>cmn_Hant<< India is the seventh largest country in the world.
Her daughter is beautiful.
>>cmn_Hant<< Kate hardly speaks Chinese.
>>cmn_Hant<< More and more people go to rural areas.
>>cmn_Hant<< You should learn to shut your mouth.
Would you please open the door?
Can I see it now?
>>cmn_Hant<< They go to church every Sunday.
>>cmn_Hant<< Money does not grow from trees.
He's afraid of making mistakes.
>>cmn_Hant<< She gave him a soft kiss.
What are you suggesting?
Have you ever loved a man?
>>cmn_Hant<< She asked herself about this herself.
I can't stand it.
>>cmn_Hant<< Why don't you listen to his advice?
>>cmn_Hant<< He has a good character.
>>cmn_Hant<< According to my experience, mastering French grammar takes one year.
I want a massage. I need to relax.
We'll have guests tomorrow.
Do you understand?
>>cmn_Hant<< The pool is open to the public.
>>cmn_Hant<< There's a hole on the ceiling.
>>cmn_Hant<< Sally, getting the invisible glasses out of the previous day.
This year’s apples are especially sweet.
You have to send a doctor.
He didn't give me anything.
It takes an hour to go there.
I'll do it.
>>cmn_Hant<< I tried to run my best, but I didn't catch the train.
You're going so fast!
>>cmn_Hant<< There is a painting on the wall.
>>cmn_Hant<< Many people speak only one language.
>>cmn_Hant<< I'm not always right, I always blame you when you make mistakes.
Peace on the way!
>>cmn_Hant<< I don't have knee to put my hand on the ground.
"Did he write a letter yesterday?" "Yes," he wrote.
I'm disappointed I couldn't go with her.
Can I try this?
It's really cheap.
>>cmn_Hant<< I feel very confused about his problems.
>>cmn_Hant<< I think this table is low.
>>cmn_Hant<< He managed to pass through the crowd.
>>cmn_Hant<< Do you know what is the difference between microscopes and telescopes?
I don't dare kill animals.
He's alone there.
I used to be there.
I'll borrow you.
Next time I'll be there sooner.
I know him.
We're done.
>>cmn_Hant<< I went to the ball and my mother helped take care of the baby.
My dog always followed me.
>>cmn_Hant<< You've got too many books on the shelf.
I don't know if he loves me.
>>cmn_Hant<< How'd your fingerprints be on this glass?
>>cmn_Hant<< I didn't buy a new car this year.
>>cmn_Hant<< It's easier than doing it.
>>cmn_Hant<< We hear the roar of far away tigers.
Where's the boss?
The flight was cancelled.
>>cmn_Hant<< He opposed racism.
Do you walk to school every day?
I was with him the same year.
That's not good.
>>cmn_Hant<< I consider the fruit as the healthiest food.
>>cmn_Hant<< He saved the baby, but sacrificed his own life.
We accept checks.
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow.
>>cmn_Hant<< No matter how cold it is outside, the room is always comfortable and warm.
He stole my sister's toys.
>>cmn_Hant<< The school needs a new teacher.
>>cmn_Hant<< You shouldn't read books in that dark room.
Fire is dangerous.
>>cmn_Hant<< This is a turning point in history.
Where is my watch?
>>cmn_Hant<< Many believe that all foreign-made items are superior to those made in this country.
>>cmn_Hant<< You killed my father and I'm going to avenge him today.
How long have you known Jack?
What a strong wind!
Look at that picture on the table.
>>cmn_Hant<< Our school has 50 years of history.
What do you want to do tomorrow?
I don't know how to use it.
>>cmn_Hant<< Did you hear about yesterday's fire?
Please complete the account.
>>cmn_Hant<< This book is for students who don't speak Japanese.
Tom likes to swim.
>>cmn_Hant<< He went to Nagoya because of his bus.
It'll be cold tonight.
>>cmn_Hant<< I called my son before I got on the plane and called him to take me to the airport.
I want to be my secretary.
I'll catch them soon.
>>cmn_Hant<< He walked in the park yesterday.
>>cmn_Hant<< I visited Fukuoka ten years ago.
>>cmn_Hant<< He lost the umbrella again.
>>cmn_Hant<< This one is still alive.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom said he was happy that Mary graduated.
This dress cost me 40,000 yen.
>>cmn_Hant<< It looks like it's snowing, doesn't it?
I think I'd better stay here.
Tom's purpose is clear.
>>cmn_Hant<< I haven't had time to wash the dishes for two days, and now the kitchen has filled the bowl dishes.
This button's off.
How are you?
I look forward to it.
This boy loves painting.
>>cmn_Hant<< Jim takes the bus to school.
What does it contain?
We're ready to leave.
>>cmn_Hant<< I heard a strange noise.
>>cmn_Hant<< You may not remember me, but I remember you.
>>cmn_Hant<< Silvio Berlusconi, except an Italian politician and current Italian Prime Minister, was also a successful businessman.
>>cmn_Hant<< South West invited him to the party.
>>cmn_Hant<< I don't think this project is very smart.
>>cmn_Hant<< He never went to school late.
You can order some rules for me.
>>cmn_Hant<< I woke up at 5:00 that morning.
>>cmn_Hant<< The shop didn't fit my size hat.
>>cmn_Hant<< When he arrived at the train station, the train had already opened for about half an hour.
She looks very elegant.
I like to laugh.
>>cmn_Hant<< Who do you usually go to the movies?
How big is your suitcase?
Hello.
He stayed at his aunt's house.
You're so cold.
>>cmn_Hant<< Her French speaks fluently.
>>cmn_Hant<< When I was going out, the phone rang.
>>cmn_Hant<< Who do you think is wrong?
>>cmn_Hant<< The girl's eyes filled with tears.
He's a good student.
>>cmn_Hant<< He's good at playing guitar.
>>cmn_Hant<< The plane is the fastest way to travel.
>>cmn_Hant<< Almost all the work is done.
>>cmn_Hant<< This pen is better than that.
>>cmn_Hant<< She hurriedly cleared her room.
Can you give me salt, please?
>>cmn_Hant<< He looked up at the sky.
You think too much.
>>cmn_Hant<< Kitaro and his friends stay in Kyoto.
>>cmn_Hant<< For the people of these countries, hunger is normal.
>>cmn_Hant<< He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
>>cmn_Hant<< This business is facing deficits.
>>cmn_Hant<< I heard Mary wanted to get divorced.
I'm late at night.
It's almost three.
>>cmn_Hant<< I was born on February 14, 1960.
Tom didn't want to do that.
She's obviously sick.
No, I don't speak English.
She's Brazilian.
You should help him.
>>cmn_Hant<< Not until then I was really scared.
>>cmn_Hant<< After the job, he suffered a very hard day.
I tried not to think about it.
We're a family.
You shouldn't borrow people like that.
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom is a good man.
>>cmn_Hant<< This work has been completed half.
>>cmn_Hant<< He bought a dress for his daughter.
She finally arrived at the hotel.
>>cmn_Hant<< You're being treated unfairly.
>>cmn_Hant<< He should buy a new bike for his son.
You lack patience.
>>cmn_Hant<< He hit his opponent down.
You might want to tell me everything.
>>cmn_Hant<< Always be careful of the road.
>>cmn_Hant<< The grass is long and the evil practices are easy to dye.
I told her you were a good girl.
Tom doesn't want us to help.
>>cmn_Hant<< After you finish reading, give me the book back.
>>cmn_Hant<< During hot season, some foods can easily get bad.
>>cmn_Hant<< She occasionally had a mood of excitement.
If you can come.
I've cleaned my room.
Don't forget me.
Thank you. I've been eating.
I'm sorry to bother you.
The weather is great!
I want to go to America.
>>cmn_Hant<< Bob also drives.
>>cmn_Hant<< Did you approve what he said in the book?
>>cmn_Hant<< When this lady learned that she had won millions of dollars, she was really mad.
She travels around the world.
>>cmn_Hant<< It's true, these two are still being repaired.
Do you like fish?
>>cmn_Hant<< Tom tells them not to do that.
You want some fried eggs?
It's snowing.
>>cmn_Hant<< My boss wanted to take me cheap, and I took a hand in his hand and let him no longer shave his hair.
I hope you're healthy.
I really like your company.
I can understand what she's saying.
Do you have a smaller size?
>>cmn_Hant<< When she opened the door, a cat ran out.
>>cmn_Hant<< The wound flows out of the fluid.
In other words, he works harder than you do.
I heard he was dead.
>>cmn_Hant<< Motherbirds come to caterpillars.
I took pictures for my family.
>>cmn_Hant<< He was fired by the factory's boss.
Thank you for picking me up.
I guess you're right.
I'll wait until 4:00.
>>cmn_Hant<< We discussed three hours, but not a bit further.
>>cmn_Hant<< He may have missed the last train.
>>cmn_Hant<< The lowest temperature today is three degrees.
>>cmn_Hant<< We went into tea leaves from India.
>>cmn_Hant<< If you haven't paid for it because what we did to make you unhappy, can you tell us?
She's big.
You want some coffee?
>>cmn_Hant<< She left her home ten minutes ago.
I don't like it.
What do you want to eat?
I had to stay in bed all day.
>>cmn_Hant<< Both teams were not well played in the match.
