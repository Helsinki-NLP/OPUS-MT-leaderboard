Time is around us, and it affects everything we do, but it is hard to understand.
By faith, philosophy, and scientists, the time has taken thousands of years.

Convergent Thinging Options are techniques to solve problems, and it is a matter of seeking a solution by bringing together different ideas or fields.
The focus of this thinking is on speed, memory and accuracy, as well as reality, re-alignment, and gathering of long-standing techniques.

Instead of maintaining contact with the next, students can ask teachers questions at any hour of the day and find quick answers in a logical way.
If there is any present-day way of teaching, let it be set free from one of the steps: there is no way of learning well.
