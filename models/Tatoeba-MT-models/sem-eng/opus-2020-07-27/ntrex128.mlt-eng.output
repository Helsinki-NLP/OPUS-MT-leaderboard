AMs from Wales are afraid to "be seen as boloh"
There is a continuum among some AMs following a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This was raised by plans to change the name of the Welsh Parliament assembly.
AMs across the political spectrum are concerned that this will make them look ridiculous .
AM Labourist said that his group was concerned that "it has the same sound as Twp and Pwp."
For outside readers Wales: In the language of Wales twp means a arrow and a pop means a bull.
AM of Plade said that the whole group “was unhappy and suggested alternatives.
Conservative of Wales said that his group had an "open mind" on the change in name, but noted that there was a small verbal difference from MWP to "Muppet".
In this context the letter w in the Walls language is presented in a manner similar to the declaration of the letter and.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce changes in the name, said: "The final decision on any descriptionr of what should be called the Members of the Assembly will of course be a matter for the members themselves."
The Act of the Government of Wales of 2017 empowered the assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that had broad support for the assembly to be called the Wales Parliament.
On the issue of the AM title, the Commission favoured Members of Parliament of Wales or WMPs, but MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
Apparently, AMs are suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching consensus may be a headache for the Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes in the way the assembly works, including rules on the qualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on the issue of how to call when they have a debate on legislation.
In Macedonia they leave public opinion in a referendum on changes in the name of the country
Votes will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "North Republic of Macedonia".
The popular vote was established with a view to finding a solution to a decade-long dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern garden represents .
The President of Macedonia Gridge Ivanov, an opponent of the opposition to the change in name, said that he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zuran Zaev, argue that the change in name is simply the consequence of entry into the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Pencil Stops as the Churches in Harlem are sending
"Horithically, the elders I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr Adams.
"Today, there is no one."
He said he could understand how they hid the bars.
He said, "People socialise differently" today.
"The bar is no longer the centre of local activity where people go on a regular basis."
With regard to churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders think, "and today or tomorrow they will come to an end where they were at first."
It added that churches can be replaced by condominated apartment blocks filled with the type of people that will not help the rest of the local sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who buy condoms in this building will be a white cardinal," he said, "and thus, they won't relax when it comes to the day that they are created for these churches because most of these people who enter these domains will not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by congregations of white cardinals before Harlem became metrollarians of white cardinals - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St Martin's ten years later.
The original Methodist Congregation of white cardinals left in the 1990s.
A community of black Ukraine people who were practicing religion in close proximity took the title to the building.
St. Martin's was taken by a congregation of black Ukraine people under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a retailer boat in 125 Street, a main road for buying in Harlem, who insisted on hiring or promoting black Ukraine's people.
Fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but as Rutherford Johnson’s pastors made plans to rebuild it, commissioned the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, Peter Johnson's son and successor of St. Martin's, was proud when he called the carillon "the monks of the people."
The expert who knocked on the carillon in July called it another ghetto: "Culture Treasure" and "single historical instrument."
The expert, Tifani Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that she was the first carllon in the world to have a black cardinal musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who went to the largest carilon in the Church of Reverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not change with anyone else.
What happened in St. Martin's during the last few months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some introduced by the leaders of the lay church, others by the evangelical Diocese.
The ‘vestry’ – the parliamentary body of the parish, made up of lay leaders – wrote the Diocese in July with concern that the Diocese will ‘see to pass the costs’ to the victim, although the vestry was not involved in connecting the characters and contractors that he sent from the Diocese.
Some parliamentarians complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the Diocesian.
The sea dog hurts a 13-year-old boy during a whale’s holiday in California
The sea dog attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was loading for the Audience in California on the day of the opening of the Audience season, said the officers.
The attack took place shortly before the 7th morning where Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was working with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and then went out with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the excitement of the post to catch a beaver, but then he realized that he was shouting, ‘ I'm crying!
Himmed me!'
He took it and opened the whole club," Hammel said that he realized the moment he arrived where the boy came from.
"So that everyone comes out of the water: 'He is the dog of the sea in the water!" added Hammel.
They took the child by helicopter to Rady Child's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The species of the sea dog responsible for the attack was unknown.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said at a meeting with the media that the sea dog was fed in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous dog species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic wounds in the upper part of the torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casblad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
The Sainsburi's plans enter the UK's beauty market.
Sainsbory's is competing against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with corridors of similar shafts to those of ‘depart site’ of beauty products equipped with specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial market share of £2.8 billion in the UK’s beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of clothing and household goods decline, larger corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 shops across the country and the idea will spread into more shops next year if it is successful.
Investment in beauty came after the supermarkets were looking for ways to use space on the bats that was once used for TVs, microwaves and articles for domestic use.
Sainsbury's said that it will double the amount of the beauty goods that you are offering up to 3000 items, including firms such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The Commission therefore concludes that the measures in question constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.
The supermarket will also re-launch its Botique mike to make the majority of products fit for vignettes – something increasingly required by smaller buyers.
In addition, the retailer of the Fragrance Shop perfume will examine concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, which first opened in Croydon, London, the other week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
On-line shopping and a shift to buying with small amounts of food per day at local convenience shops means that supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to buy from there.
Mike Coupe, executive head of Sainsburi's, said that shops will increasingly look like ‘department seasons’ as the supermarkets try to fight the stores that calculate Aldi and Lidl prices with more services and non-food products.
In this regard, the Commission considers that the aid granted to Argos by Argo was compatible with the internal market and that the aid granted by Argo was incompatible with the internal market.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to renew the departments of beauty and its ministry did not succeed.
Sainsbury's piloted a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the link ended after a fight on how to share the incomes from pharmacist shops in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was introduced after Sainsburi's sale of the office business with 281 shops to Celesio, the owner of the Loyds Pharmacy chain, to £125 million, three years ago.
He said that Loyds will play a role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury skin care firms including La Roche-Posy and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business director of Sainsburi's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and sensation of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
The range of our firms has been designed to be appropriate for every need and the environment that attracts you and the convenient market positions mean that we have become a destination of the beauty products of interest that challenge the old way of buying."
Peter Jones 'very angry' after Holly Willoughby cancels an agreement of £11 million
The personality of Dragons Den Peter Jones 'very angry' after TV presenter TV Holly Willoughby cancelled an agreement of £11 million with the business of his life-style firm to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for the firm of home products and their accessories, Truly.
The business of the pair was compared to the firm of Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop.
The presenter of This Morning, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce that he will leave.
Holly Willoughby left the personality of Dragons" Den Peter Jones very angry because he was cancelled from being part of their business of a life-style firm that makes money in the last minute - to focus on her big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was "very angry" when the very popular television personality admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his enrome headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, whose new agreements - up to £1.5 million - meant that it would no longer have enough time to dedicate it to their brand of household products and accessories, Truly.
The business was compared with the firm of Gwyneth Paltrow Goop and was thought to double the estimated wealth of Willoughby of £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly, Jones left Great Britain and went to one of his private exiles.
The source said: "Truly was by far the first priority of Holly.
It would have been its long-term future that would have filled it with the next few decades.
Her decision to leave has left everyone completely surprised.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch had almost arrived.
There is a full store produced at Marlow's headquarters ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morting, located among the personalities of Great Britain which brings profit, could mean a cost of millions for the company due to large investment in goods from wet and candles to household and household products, and the potential for further delay until its launch.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three children, Willoughby and her boyfriend Dan Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as Chairman Chairman Chairman in March.
The couples join and Jones has a 40 per cent share in the Baldwin television production company.
Willoughby shall become ambable to the M&S firm and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of I'm'm A Celibry of ITV.
Yesterday evening, Jones's nearby source said, "We don't comment about his economic affairs."
A difficult meeting 'but then we found love'
He commented on criticism that he would be leaving the news media because he made a comment that some people consider "non-presiding" and because he was so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with a voice to imitate that of the "news presenter".
"I didn't say anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump held that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But denuclearisation negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's best diplomat, Ri Young Ho, told world leaders, on Saturday, at the General Assembly, that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to the early steps of North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, note, the US continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in the speech of his demonstration.
He said, "We're walking well with North Korea".
"We were going to enter a war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have this very good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results – the end of rocket tests, aid for the freedom of passengers and the return of the remaining US veterinarys.
And he defended his unusual approach while talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside who are trying to get into this man- filled arena, we had about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing at the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunamis and Terremot in Indonesia Destroys Island, Killing Hundreds of People
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not required.
Even after more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had to move from their home, no national disaster, a pre-requisite for catalysing international aid, was declared.
" Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, making it a challenge," said Ms. Sombung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to travel to Palu, it is unclear whether foreign staff can operate on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, speaker of the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Given the earthquakes that often occur in Indonesia, the country is still not well prepared for the great anger of nature.
While shelter from the tsunamis was built in Aceh, you do not see them very much on the coast.
The apparent failure of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite having issued an alert, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
In the best times, travel between the numerous Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship was posted in Lombok to care for the victims on its way to Palu, but it will last at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has improved the infrastructure falling into parts of Indonesia, the centre of his electoral campaign, and spent a lot of money on roads and trains.
But Mr. Joko's administration gave because of the lack of funds as he faced his election again next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from still stuporary tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of this faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to move from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the road, using ‘machetes’, bows and arrows and other types of weapons.

The number of deaths in Indonesia tsunamis rises to 832
The number of deaths in Indonesia’s tsunami rose to 832, said the country’s disaster agency early on Sunday.
Many people were reportedly caught under the breakdown of buildings that fell due to the 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and caused up to 20 feet high waves, said a speaker by the agency Sutopo Pureo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was full of broken buildings.

The state of the Parliament of Cromwell becomes the last monument affected by the argument on the ‘rewriting of history’.
Date of birth: Approximately 1963.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "wrapped" and "stripped to rewritten history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of the stats that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The ‘iconoclam’ of the English civil war was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the evil Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his Thomas anteenate in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of a 19th-century opinion and part of the still widely believed figure geography.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraf: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a champion of the parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-century conflict of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure which is recognised as representing one side of that divide.
Its achievements as a 'Lord Projector' also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated."
Cutting a Catastrophe Attacks and Kills a Chinese Workers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in the south-west of China, according to local media reports.
The man, only identified with his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a cut-off, blood-covered battery near the market of Lipanshui in Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post.
Pig farmers prepare to inject vaccines into pigs in ‘hoggy’ on 30 May 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
He allegedly traveled with his cousin from nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered a door to the pig pods nearby open.
He said that there was a hemorrhage in his mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had attacked the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"Chean legs were bloody and killed," said the cousin, who referred to him with his surname "Wu," as quoted by the Guyang Evening News.
The safety camera videos showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday 4.40 in the morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about one hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was not of Yuan or his cousins.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was shut down to not attack anyone else, while the police collected evidence on the ground.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking people have been recorded earlier.
in 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man ended up severely injured.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig kept a farmer from Wales with its tractor until he expelled the animal from his wife.
After the pigs of a farmer from Orion attacked him and ate him in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba Farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the blood taste can act as "cause."
"They would be playing.
They work, they are very curious ... do not intend to hurt you.
You just want to show them the appropriate amount of respect," he said.
Uruguay Rosa’s remains will bring heavy rains across the south-east of the United States
As predicted, Uruguay Rosa is being weakened as it moves on the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods around northern Mexico and south-eastern the United States in the coming days.
Rosa brought a wind of 85 mph, Uragan Category 1, at 5 a.m. on Sunday morning, and was located 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it is forming a ‘throw’ on the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will start pushing a strong tropical humidity in a north-west direction to the United States
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, a tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching ‘trough’ creates severe rainfall across the South-East in the coming days.
Locally, from 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous rapid flooding, residue flows and possible valangi in the desert.
A strong tropical dam will cause rain rates to approach 2 to 3 inch per hour in parts, especially south parts of Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the South, especially on most of the Arizona.
The rapid flooding is possible under rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread character of tropical rain.
It would not be a good idea to walk through the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
Pregnant rain can cause canyons to become dangerous rivers and storms will bring many local warm winds and dust.
The trout will bring some rain to parts of the southern coast of California.
They are possible for a total rain of more than half a inch, which can cause small spills and slipways.
This will be the first rain of their rain-season region.
Some of the scattered tropical rains begin to move to Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more scattered later on Monday and Tuesday.
A strong winter spreads in Fourcorns on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October there could be some severe changes in temperature across the US as the Arctic cools, but tropical areas remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There will be a major example of dramatic temperature differences from the US Centre on Sunday.
There is almost a difference in the temperature of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St Louis and Des Moines, Ioa.
During the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to develop and expand.
A large part of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a warm start in October at temperatures in the 80s from the Southern Plans to parts of the North-East.
New York City can rise to 80 degrees on Tuesday, approximately 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate high possibilities for temperatures above the US average during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people saw the very interesting testimony on Thursday of the nominated candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of committing an alleged sexual attack in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political struggle continued, with broadcasters who interrupted regular programming with the shocking news of the last minute of Friday: an agreement drawn up by the Prefect of Arizona Jeff Flash for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that it is a certain 100 percent that Kavanaugbasha was under the influence of alcohol and tried to remove her clothes when they were a post-secondary school festival.
Kavanagh, in testimony by passion, said he was 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday are likely to have seen it.
The company was counting the average number of telescopes on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Business Network.
And Nielsen generally finds it difficult to calculate the number of viewers from offices.
To put this in perspective, it is a audience size similar to that for the decisive football game or for Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionants strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was at the forefront of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day session, said Nielsen.
ABC was just behind it with 3.26 million telescopes.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Place was the central figure in the drama of Friday.
Following a modest Republican office issued a declaration that it would vote in favour of Kavanawagh, those who protested against CNN and CBS cameras were caught on Friday morning and were crying with him as soon as he tried to go to the lift for a hearing of the Committee of the Judiciary.
He remained there standing with his eyes looking down for several minutes as he was being aggressively criticised, in a live broadcast on CNN.
"You stand right here before me," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to a country?
They said to him, "You have the power when many women have nothing."
Falke said that his office issued a statement and said, before closing the lift doors, which will have more to say in the committee's hearing.
All cable and broadcasting networks were broadcasting directly, hours later, when the Committee of the Judiciary had to vote to advance Kavanagh's nomination for the Senate in full for a vote.
But Falke said that he would do so only with the understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the designated person in the following week, that the democratic minorities have been encouraging.
Falke was partly convinced of conversations with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coon.
After a conversation with Coon and several year-olds later, Falke took his decision.
The decision of Falke had the power, because it was evident that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanagh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
English Prime Minister May accuses critics of "taking advantage of policy" on Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union to "take advantage" of policy and undermine national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain Teresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview after her on the front page of the newspaper, her former minister for foreign affairs Boris Johnson pressed his attack of the so-called Plan 'Chequers' for Brexit, saying that a proposal that the Great Britain and the EU should collect the fees of each other was "fully condemned."
The shooting at Wayde Sims: Police arrested suspected Dayton Simpson after the death of LSU's player
The police arrested a suspected gunman who killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on second-degree murder charge, said Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials issued a confrontation film between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the field and said they found Simpson DNA on them, reporting the CBS' affiliation, WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that they admitted to shoot and killed Wayde.
His bond was set at $350,000, reports Advocate.
The post office of the Paris branch of East Baton Rouge has issued a preliminary report on Friday, which said that the cause of death is damage from head to neck.
The department is crediting the police force of the Luiziana State Police, the state police crime laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area to assist in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The director of the athletics of LSU Joe Alleva thanked the enforcement of the law of the area for "diligence and the search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The attacker who was 2 meters long, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for the LSU.
It had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 ‘rebounds’ per game in the past season.
Friday morning, the basketball coach of LSU Will Wede said that the team is "lost" and "under shock" after Weyde's death.
"This is what worries him all the time," said Wade.
Volkan discards ash on Mexico City
Discards which are being disposed of from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern area of Mexico's capitals.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the quartzer increased and 183 gas emissions and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring several sounds and cathotonic movements.
Social media images showed thin layers of ash that covered car windscreens in the vicinity of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geography physicists noted an increase in activity in the volcano located at 45 miles (72 km) south of capital after a earthquake of 7.1 in the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
"Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police have a conflict with separations from Catalonia before the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors in favour of independence had a conflict with the anti-insurgency police, and as thousands joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarisation vote on the coup.
A group in favour of cover-up members who have been held back by the anti-insurgency police have left eggs and dust paints, and created a cloud of dark dust on the streets that are usually full of tourists.
There were also small fighting during the day and the police had to use the albums to control the fighting.
Over a period of several hours, pro-independence groups used to say "I do not forget, I do not apologize" to fight against united protestors crying, "Span for All."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in the protests, reported the local press.
Tensions remained high in the region that wanted independence one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by Madrid but which was celebrated by separations from Catalonia.
Voters chose with a huge gap to become independent, although participation was low with those who were against the recession that made a big counter-voting boat.
According to the Catalonia authorities, almost 1000 people spoke last year after the police tried to stop voting in voting stations across the region in violent fighting.
Independence groups had camped all night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of national police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different route.
Narciss Termes, 68, electricist who attended the separateist protest with his wife said that they no longer hoped in the prospects that Catalonia achieves independence.
"Last year we lived with one of our wonderful moments.
I saw my mother and father crying with joy that they could vote but now alone," he said.
Despite having had a vital and narrow victory in the regional elections last December, the parties in favour of the independence of Catalonia are sending to maintain the momentum this year with many of their best known leaders or in their own decision-making or detention and are waiting for the process due to their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was registering the protest on his phone in support of the police, said that the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
"There is more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalonia leaders who is in prison before the process since the end of last year, announced that he would challenge the elections of the European Parliament next year.
"By going out as a candidate for the European elections it is the best way to condemn resonance in democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car entered a healthy house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years of age, were arrested after a car entered more than once in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Balyngard Crescent on Thursday at the close of 19:30 BST.
Investigator Bob Blemmings said that the damage was caused to the grades and to the buildings itself.
Seta was also used 'crossbow' to shoot at the car at a moment.
Menga's Goal wins game 1-0 for Livingston against Ringers
First ‘goal’ of Dolly Menga’s for Livingston won the game
Livingston, which has been promoted, has bleed to Ringers and thus Steven Gerard has been lost for the second time only in 18 games as a coop of the Ibrox Club.
The band of Dolly Menga's has made the entire difference as the side of Gary Holt was equal in the points with Hibernian in the second place.
Gerard's side remained unwinned once outside its grand at the Premiership this season and the next Sunday will play against Heats, which first places and sits behind them with eight points.
Before that game, Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna in their grand in Europa League on Thursday.
While Livingston continues not to have a loss in division in six games, with Holt main coach who has not lost a game since it came instead of Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against crazy visitors
Holt's team had long held that he was winning before he had a ‘goal’, with the direct style of his games that was causing many problems for Ringers.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but distributed the ball in front of the blast, then Alan Lithgow could only distribute the ball with a wide body after he had dragged to get to receive the ball from Craig Halket near the blast.
Those who were playing in their own throat were happy to let Ringers play in front of them, because they knew that the visitors could have given them the problems at certain moments.
And that was the way in which the crucial 'goal' came.
Ringers allowed Free-Kick to enter and Livingston took the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to help Menga, who touched the ball and entered the Lasta from the centre of the box.
Until that moment, Ringers were dominated by the possession of the ball, but were finding the defence of the team they were playing in their own grand, not pentrable, and the ‘Goalkeeper’ Liam Kelly had little trouble,
That style of games continued even in the second half of the game, but Alfredo Morelos made Kelly welcome the ball.
Scott Pitttman was unable to find ‘goal’ because of the ‘Goalkeeper’ of Ringers Allan McGregor and Lithgow shot the ball widely after they distributed another player of Livingston.
Bellen had always entered the box of Livingston and had always been removed from their players, while two requests for ‘penality’ - after Halket's attempt on the Glenn Middleton replacement, and another after the ball was sent by a player - were rejected.
Fenomenals’ from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland inside the Arena Tony Macaroni
Performance and phenomenal outcome for Liveningston.
For a man, they were excellent, they continued to outstrip expectations on this upward shift.
The style of games and their staff has not changed much from returning to the main fight, but the most credit should go to Holt to the way he has joined the team since he arrived.
He had a lot of hero.
The Head of Halkett was very big in his games, by organising an extremely well organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe World with seven eyes.
However, Ringers had a lack of inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at certain moments under Gerard, there was a lack of standards all the time.
Their last opportunity with the ball was not good-- only once they managed to break the defence of the team that was playing in his own grand--and it is a sign for Ringers, who find themselves in the middle of the class.
Erdogan received different reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) there were people shouting and blue sky as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They did not agree on issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne to open a huge new monitor.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The Police cited safety reasons to block a large crowd of 25,000 people from being collected in front of the vehicle, but many people supporting it appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan – many of them Kurdi – also mentioned their voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to meet in the country.
The protests against each other reflect the separation of a visitor who is a hero for certain German Tork and believed to be a ‘autocrat’ from others.
Road collision in Deptford: Cyclest died in a car collision
Ciclest died in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision took place near the intersection of the Bastwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic road in Deptford, south-east of the city, to the collision of 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and attended the paramedics, but the man died on the spot.
This encounter took place a few months after another cyclist died after he hit a car and continued to travel in Childers Street, around the distance from last Saturday's match.
The Metropolitan Police said that officials were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and car deviations are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Prison of Long Lartin: Six officials in disorder
Six prison officers were beaten following a prison disorder of high security men, said by the Prison Office.
The disorder began in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire for the collision of 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
Specialised "Tornado" officers have been introduced to address the disorder, involving eight prisoners and located in one of the sections.
Officials were treated for minor on-the-spot injuries.
Prison Service Speaker said: "Specially trained prison staff has been deployed to address an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we will be clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of those who committed the most dangerous crimes in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year anti-insurgency officers were called to prison to address a serious disorder in which the staff was attacked with pool balls.
The Urgan Rosa Threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with the Fast Flood (Wild Areas can benefit)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is likely to occur next week as the remaining energy of Uruguay Rosa moves south-west of the desert, leading to rapid flood risks.
The National Temp Service has already established a rapid flood guard for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line from Phoenix on Tuesday, and closes late Monday with rain.
The National Temp Phonix Service noted in a tweet that "only ten tropical cycles maintained tropical weather or depression status at a distance of 200 miles from Phonix since 1950"!
Katrin (1967) was a uragan at a distance of 40 miles from the border of AZ."
The latest models of the National Centre of Uruguay predict from 2 to 4 inch of rain, with amounts isolated up to 6 inches in the Rem of Arizona.
Other South-West Desert areas including the Central Rockies and the Basin Great are likely to have up to 2 inch in diameter, with possible isolated totals up to 4 inches.
For those at risk of rapid flooding, the rain of Rosa may be positive as the region is affected by drought.
Although the floods are a very serious issue, some of this rain is likely to be beneficial as the south-west is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the drought monitoring device, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category,” reported by Weather.com.
First, the route of the Uragan Rosa was brought to the next corner of the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who will still be very strong urgan on Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, will be located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and will move north with 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting colder waters in the Pacific and is therefore losing power.
As a result, it is expected to touch Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or early evening.
Rain in parts of Mexico can be strong, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"A rain toll of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to the north-west of Sonora, with a possibility of not more than 10 inches", reported by Weather.com.
Then Rosa will travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the border of Arizona in the early morning hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move from Arizona and south of Utah until late on Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains is a very heavy rain in Baja California, in the north-west of Sonora, and in the south-west of the United States," they said from the National Centre of Uruguay.
This rain is expected to produce rapid life-threatening flooding and erosion flows in deserts, and mountain-terrene valanges.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested after attempted murder
Three adolescents and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected attempted murder following the discovery of a 16-year-old adolescent with knife wounds in Somerset.
The adolescent child was found to be injured in Excelsior Terrace in the Midsomer Norton area, at 04:00 BST on Saturday.
Take him to the hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon, said the Somerset Police.
Officials appealed to anyone who could have a video pulled from the phone of what happened to speak.
Trump said that Kavanaugh ‘sent out the red and the angry’ of the Democratic Party
"Vote to Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the merciless and shocking Tutsis of the Democratic Party," said Trump during a demonstration in Weeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanawagh ‘sent out the red and the angry’ of the Democratic Party during its nomination process.
Kavanah witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, with power and with emotion denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he attacked her sexually for decades when they were adolescents.
Ford also testified at the hearing about its allegation.
Saturday, the President said that, at that time, the "American people saw the bravura and the quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"Vote confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of the most legitimate minds of our time, a jurist with an impeccable public service record", he told the crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the designation of Kavanaugh and spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
Who didn't contest, but in truth, I'm challenging," he said.
"I am therefore going everywhere to fight for very good candidates."
Trump argued that the Democratics have a mission to "resist and obstruct."
The first main procedural vote within the Senate on the designation of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior management assistant of the GOP told CNN.
Hundreds were killed by Indonesian earthquake, from the tsunami, with an increasing number of deaths.
At least 384 people were killed, many suffered as huge waves fell hard on beaches, after a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six metres (18 ft) went down hard on the ground as soon as it became dark, while many suffered and died and destroyed everything that was in the middle.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5-power earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat broke out yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not rise to happen immediately and ended up victims," said Sutopo Puro Nugroho, the speaker for the Indonesia disaster mitigation agency BNPB during a brifing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not appear alone, attracted cars, logs, houses, hit everything that was on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled along the open sea with speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before it hit the shore.
Some people took the trees to escape from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evicted to 24 centres in Palu.
Air photos issued by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, self-turning bridges and fell and a water-circuited Moscow.
Strong shocks continued to drain the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated in the declaration that the energy that emerged from the huge earthquake of the Week was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
They said that the city's geography, located at the edge of a long narrow beach, could have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroo described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels had fallen.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the breakdown of damaged buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the centre of the earthquake.
Communications "were completely sent without information" by Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but you can get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was strongly criticised for not informing that it had not reportedly affected Palu, although officials said that the waves had reached the time of the warning.
A man on the top floor of a building can be heard shouting anxiety warnings to the tsunamis that were approaching people on the lower road.
In a few minutes an enormous amount of water fell strongly on the shore, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not authenticate the videos immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe cut-off of light which reduced communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The authorities said that the military began sending cargo planes with the assistance of Jakarta and other cities, but evacuations still need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has only been reopened for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths well exceeds 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While the staff of World Vision's from Dongala arrived strong and complete in the city of Palu, where the employees are sheltering themselves have been bombarded by gunmans in the vicinity of their office, they have gone from where they are on their way, said Mr Dosbaa.
He said, "He said that he saw many houses destroyed."
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups started the unpleasant process of disaster aid, some complained about the fact that highly skilled foreign aid workers were not being allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and staff from abroad may only start if the disaster site is declared as a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
"There is a disaster in the province," said Aulia Ariani, a speaker for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Since the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can introduce international assistance but so far there is no status."
At the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family of the missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that imitate this history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy came out of a sewer.
On Sunday, people who carried out a rescue released a woman who was caught under crushing for two days near her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesian national team coach of Paragliding, had trained two of the missing paragliders for Asian Games, which ended this month early in Indonesia.
Other of those caught in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
"As a superior person in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon related how, at hours after the news of the fall of the Locand Roa Roa circulated among the paragliding community, he sent messages in a way, desperately, with whatasapp to Palu’s competitors, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, only marked that they left, but did not mark that they arrived.
"I think that's what means the messages didn't come," he said.
Allowing them to take $26,750 while ATM was being refilled in Newport on the Live

The driver of the car was loading ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Inspector Dennis McCarty wrote in the statement.
While he was occupied with his work, another man "came to happen from behind the Blink's employee" and stole a cash bag intended for delivery.
According to the statement, the witnesses saw many suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities shall contact the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Canye West: The rap cant change his name for Ye
The moment of the rap Kanye West is changing his name - for Ye.
While proclaiming the change in Twitter on Saturday, he said: "The man who was previously known as Kanye West"
West, 41, was vaccinated Ye for some time and used the monitor as the title for his eighth album, which was issued in June.
The change is made before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
He replaced the Ariana Grande on the program that was cancelled for "motive reasons," said the programme creator.
In addition to being a clarification of his current professional name, West previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible means "you," said West earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with the radio presenter Big Boy.
"Alura I am, you, me we, she, us.
From Kanye which means ‘the only one’, for Ye only - simply reflecting what we have good, bad, what disturbs us, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
It is one of a number of famous rap singers who changed their name.
Sian Combs was known as Puff Diddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but the year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
As one who cooperated with West, JAY-Z, it is also served with or without a single and capital letters.
Mexicanamlo promises not to use troops against civilians
The elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use a military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tallolco Cup that "have passed will not use the military to restrict the Mexican people."
The troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when left student movements were being established in all Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by granting monthly subsidies to those who study and open more public universities free of charge.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
The US should double the I.A. funds.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this area, says the investor and practitioners of IA Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after several parts of the US government made IA notices, even though there is a lack of a formal IA strategy in the US.
In the meantime, China has introduced its plan last year: it aims to be the first in IA innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the IA research budget would be a good start, since all other countries are far behind the US, and we are looking for the next revolutional step in the IA," said Lee.
The doubling of funds could double the possibilities that the next major acquisition of IA will take place in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Hoghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent IA companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system which won the highest-ranking American Otello player, and subsequently was executive with Microsoft Research and the head of the Google branch in China.
Lee has recognised previous American government competitions in technology such as the Rootics Callinge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when it would be next, in order to help identify the next questionnaires.
Lee said that researchers in the US often have to work very hard to take government grants.
Lee said, "It is not China that is removing academic leaders; the corporations are doing it,"
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed people who inspire others from universities to work on the IA.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the US to strengthen their efforts in the IA.
He said, "I believe that the green paper should be offered automatically to people who have a Doctorate in the IA".
The China State Council issued the next Artial Generation Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organisations spend money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artistic Intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee for Artistic Intelligence.
And last month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As regards the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in IA research.
In the meantime, the US legislation that tried to create a National Artistic Intelligence Security Commission has seen no action in several months.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country;
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia," a step that would resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece that had blocked its membership offers to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the garden in its north represents a possibility of ownership of its territory and made a showto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the population of the Slovak majority of Macedonia.
President Gridge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and a boatcott campaign raised doubts as to whether participation would reach a minimum of 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote is read: "You are in favour of membership in NATO and in the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Those supporting the change in name, including Prime Minister Zuran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to enter into bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgejevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of the parliament said that they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change in name requires a majority of two-thirds of the parliament.
The State electoral commission stated that there was no report of irregularities up to 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I have been voting because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Goose Tanevski, 62, a vote in capital, Skopje.
The Latvian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country that gives him the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Stromica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, he was arming a small plate and preparing chairs in front of the tent assembled by those who would make a name for the referendum.
"We're in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to enter proudly under our conditions, not by ordering anyone else" said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If we do not accept as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that membership in NATO will bring the much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after he voted.
He said that a result in favour of the change of name would be "a confirmation of our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute said that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters will participate in the referendum - an amount below that of the required participation.
Another survey, carried out by Macedonia's Tele TV, found that 57 percent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they will vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, participation should be 50 per cent and one more vote.
If the referendum fails, it represents the first serious blow to government policy in favour of Western theologians from the moment it took control in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, passing through all of Blighton's defence to ‘goal’
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Bryson's defence at the 2-0th victory of Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his 'goal' in 65 minutes seemed very easy.
The attacker from Argentina received a ball from half the grand at the beginning of the sequence.
He was one of three defenders of Brighton before he went into an open space.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players with green flags.
Fight with one defensur before fleeing much more to the edge of the Blighton box.
Then split the ball on his left and found Starling.
The English attacker first touched the ball in the box to redistribut Aguero, who used the right foot to insert the ball at the right side of the net by passing it from where the goalker of Brighton Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero is giving some trouble to his feet," said the coach of City Pep Guardiola to journalists.
"We talked about the fact that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We had the good luck that made 'goal' at that moment."
But it was Strling that gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the fight against President League.
That ‘goal’ occurred in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball very much in the territory of Blighton in that action.
Send the ball right to Leroy Sane with the left hand very nicely.
Sane touched the ball some time before he led Starling where the blast.
The attacker of the Sky Blues touched the ball a few times and entered the net just before wet in a territory that was not supposed to enter it.
City will play against Hoffenheim at the stage of the Campion League groups at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday in Rein-Nekkar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer must play in Spoiler vs. Rockies
As Nationals were eliminated from the possibility to compete in the decisive game, there was no reason to make an effort to start again.
But the player Scherzer is so competitive that he hopes to be the 'pitcher' on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that Rockies have the possibility to play in the decisive game, which are ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West with one game.
The Rockies managed to get a chance to continue to compete with a win 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday evening, but are still looking for the first title of the division.
"Although we are playing for nothing, at least we can have the possibility to win by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be playing at the highest level of any point I can face this year.
What would you not want to compete in those circumstances?"
Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but are allegedly inclined to let Scherzer be the 'pitcher' in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting for 34 times, has had a practice session on Thursday and will be playing as a pitcher on Sunday when he is generally resting.
The player from Washington to play with his right hand is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 ‘strickout’ in 220 2/3 ‘innings’ this season.
Adverse Reactions
The President referred indirectly to the situation concerning the choice for his Supreme Court, Bert Kavanagh, speaking on the importance of the Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"In November, everything we have done will be threatened.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is very big -- who I'm contesting, but in truth, I'm objecting so I'm going everywhere to fight for very good candidates," he said.
"We see this very horrible and radical group of Democratics, we see it happening now," Trump continued.
And they are determined to regain power using any means possible, you can see the red.
They do not care who hurt, whom they want to train to gain power and control, what they want, power and control, we will not give them."
He said that the Democratics have a mission to "resiste and hinder."
"And I've seen this over the last four days," he said, and he was calling the Democratics "wrath and green and ridiculous and dishonest."
He referred to the Democratic Senate classified in the Senate Committee of Diane Feinstein on its behalf, and received a lot of negative shouting from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did they issue the document?
Uh, uh, what is it.
No, no, I expect, firstly -- her body's movements were nothing positive -- the worst movements I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a wide group.
It does not tolerate those who communicate their views
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to congratulate me, I didn't take it very much.
After all, I am the most recent MP in a list of MPs of the Labour Party that was not positively welcomed – because we communicated our views.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she fought against antisemitism.
In my case, the motion of a referee criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, issues similar to those on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The notice to the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Council of Friday evenings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the policy promise "more gracious and gentle" has been forgotten if, in fact, it has ever started in the truth.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged as acceptable for the conduct of the party.
This started soon after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I thought I had a similar political view began to expect me to change my understanding and take positions I would never agree with in other situations – both on national security and on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and, in truth, it does not make any difference - it follows me with an abuse of social media with a request that I be removed from my post of MP, that they judge the policy of the centre, and that they tell me that they do not belong to the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Yes, I know that I had the best chance more than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face many sexual or racist abuse every day but are never hidden from the comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the fact that levels of abuse have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad group and with any motion of "disassurance" or change in selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
I have been given a lot of advice over the last two years that have encouraged me to keep my opinions to me, not to be so open and then to "be all right."
But I did not enter the policy to do so.
Since my entry into Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, I have been encouraged by the negligence of the Thatcher government that has left my comprehensive school class literally in a disaster state, seeking to improve public services for those who need them most – both as local councillor or as government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I say is that when the country is moving to Brexit that will harm our families, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to release my time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in truth, the only message that I have not for Nottingham Momentum, is for my constituents, whether or not members of the Labour Party: I am proud to work for you and I promise you that no amount of threats will remove me from my office or political experience do not discourage me from acting in those I believe to be your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, which has not yet lost once, rises to the top of the classification
Two attempts could have changed a little the result, but there was no doubt that Ayr had condemned them to win this game of the day so exciting of the Tenent's Premiership.
Currently, the only team out of all ten have not lost once is the first in the rating.
Finally, it was their superior defence, as well as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities, which helped the team, who was playing in his own grand, winning, and the Peter Murchie coach had every right to be happy.
"We have had trials during our games so far, and we have not lost one yet, so I am happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Give credit to Ayr, they have taken advantage of the better opportunities than we do."
With the attempt of Grant Anderson's in 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Clymo, Ayr were winning, but, yellow paper from the head of Scotland Roy Hughes, who was allowed to play the game from the Warlors, gave Melrose the opportunity to try and Jason Baggott made an unconverted attempt.
Climoe extended the victory of Ayr with ‘penalty’, before, in the middle of the exact game, made an ‘goal’ and converted an individual attempt to bring the points to 17-5 for Ayr in the puzzle.
But Melrose started the second part of the game well and the attempt by Patrick Anderson's, converted by Baggott, reduced the gap by 5 points.
Then he stopped the game because of a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which came out of the grand on a tractor, and as soon as the game started again, Ayr continued to remove the points after an attempt by Stafford McDowell, converted by Climo.
Then, the head agent of Ayr Blair Macheerson was given yellow paper, and once again Melrose issued aggression when they made an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, after a period of hard pressure.
However, the team that was playing in his own grand again started to attack, and when he was given yellow card Struan Hotchinson for the action he made on Climo without the ball, from the line of the ‘penalty’, MacPherson touched the ball at the back of the ground of the advancing Ayr group.
Climo converted, as he did once again almost from the area from which the game starts again, after that Kyle Rowe collected the ball that met David Armstrong from the box and sent Gregor Henry, who played with the side, to the fifth attempt of the side she was playing in her own throat.

'The sea is ours': Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes that the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
Seafarers watch the naval headquarters with ropes and chains in La Paz.
Public buildings have blue flag in the ocean.
The Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours right.
Recovery is a duty."
Around Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources of the 19th century remains clear - as the desire to allow Bolivians to sail in the Pacific Ocean again.
That hope may be at its highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and sereneness, and of course is waiting for the result with a positive intention," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ECJ's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribe in Th Hague will find, in favour of the Bolivian statement, that - after decades of irregular talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate and give Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, the indigenous head-in-chief of Bolivia – who is facing a controversial battle for his re-election next year – also has much to lose in the Monday's decision.
"We are very close to having access to the Pacific Ocean again," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia - and that little would change if it did.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant Chile's territory, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the ECI judgment only comes six months after the final arguments have been heard indicates that the case "was not complicated" said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from favouring Bolivia’s case, the last four years could not have been helpful.
"The issue of access to the sea has been blocked by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
The hostile rhetoric of Morales weakened any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile, at some point, will continue to speak, but it will be very difficult to discuss after this.
Both countries have not been ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, denied the idea that court decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a "extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the "an opportunity to "end 139 years of mutual-benefit disagreement", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular Latin American presidents – was using the maritime issue as political aid.
"Bolivia will never exceed its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can trust the US
North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Young Ho says that his nation will never dismantle nuclear weapons is first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri had spoken on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to fulfil the promises they made during a summit in Singapore between the rebel leaders.
Passes his comments as the United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears to have arrived at the resumption of nuclear diplomacy which is in crisis more than three months after Singapore with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is "hope in the void" that the continued sanctions and the US's objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will never force North Korea to flee.
Washington is concerned about whether to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang making the first significant disarmament steps.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want the second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is serious to renounce weapons that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang in the next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows reveal the latest collection of massive head clothes that I've ever seen in the main shops.
If you want to add to your hat collection or completely cover the sun, you may stop looking.
The drawings of Valentino and Tom Browne have revealed a range of strange and very large head clothes for their Spring and Summer collection of 2019 on the runway that won the style set in Paris Fashion Week.
Very impracticable hats are very visible on Instagram this summer and these designers have picked up their surprising creations on the plate.
The object that appeared mostly from Valentino was an extravagant beige with a wide spread similar to the feathers that completely covered the heads of the models.
Other very large accessories included a doll covered with joules, a hat and even ant — but are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Browne also revealed a choice of strange masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Most of the coloured masks had the lips loosed and were more similar to Hannibal Lecter than ‘Haute cuture’.
One reaction was similar to the complete snorkel and goggle device , while another was like a stained ice cream con .
And if you continue with this right style.
Those who follow the fashion predict that huge hours 'bonnets' will appear in the main shops.
The very large hats come out after the release of 'La Bomba', the two-bedd long-band straw hat that was worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The ‘cult label’ responsible for the hat that is not practical anything that has been seen very much on social media has raised another major reaction on the plate - a straw bag in which almost as much as the mesh model they were carrying.
The dark orange raffle basket, surrounded by a small spray of the raffle and a white leather cuff, was the most visible creation in the 2019 Spring and Summer collection of Jacques in Paris Fashion Week.
"I expect to see large hats and sea bags in the main shops for the coming summer – since the designer made a huge impact, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for very large accessories."
John Edward: Skills in languages essential to global citizens
The independent schools of Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another set of excellent examinations results, which is only supported by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to give the best service to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, for their selected careers and for their role as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement a personalised school curriculum, we see modern languages remain the subject of popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak a man in a language he understands, he understands with his mind.
If you speak in his own language, he understands with his own heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examinations, we can see that languages are at the forefront of the ranking tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages achieved a higher degree A.
The data collected from the 74 schools that are members of the SRIS showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher grade A in the Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students also achieved A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Languages are now, as a matter of subject choice, kept in the same respect as STEM subjects (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that from reasons given by employers for sending job vacancies to fill vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to language skills shortages.
Language skills are therefore becoming more and more imperative to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career chosen, learning another language will have a real advantage in the future because it has the ability to survive such a life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a multilingual person from the front in competition.
According to a UK survey of over 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation and, by 15 percent, French is the only language spoken by two percent numbers.
That's why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
Knowing more than one language, particularly those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding a significant job.
In Scotland, each school will learn different languages.
A number of schools will focus on modern, more classical languages, while others will learn languages which are considered to be the most important for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as the Government or the Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest is, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
The Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future.
At present it cannot be denied, in a global business environment, that languages remain very important for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
The fruit ben la faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
Sunday LeBron will play for the first time with the Lackers in San Diego
The sports supporters of LeBron James no longer had much to expect to start for the first time for Los Angeles Linkers.
The coach of the Lake Wallton Lakers announced that James will play in the opening game before the start of the Sunday season against the Nuggets Denver in San Diego.
But the amount of minutes to play still needs to be determined.
"We shall be more than one and less than 48," said Wallton on the official website of the Lakers.
The journalist of the Lake Trudell Lakers wrote a tweet that, likely, James will play a limited amount of minutes.
Following the practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games ahead of the Lacker season.
"In this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself," he said.
Manufacture of Trump in West Virginia, Yutube Canal
President Donald Trump starts a wave of demonstrations of the campaign tonight in Weeling, West Virginia.
This is the first demonstration of Trump from five scheduled next week, including stops in friendly places including Tennessee and Myssipi.
By way of confirmation vote suspended for his choice to fill the vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when voting in Nov.
In time is the demonstration of Trump in West Virginia tonight and how do you see it online?
The demonstration of Trump in Welling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET toright, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the demonstration of Trump in West Virginia online below by means of a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for the nomination of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, which took place intensively due to allegations of sexual misconduct with an early confirmation vote of the Senate suspended up to one week while investigating the FBI.
But the primary objective of this wave of demonstrations is to help Republicans face the November elections to gain some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that these five exhibits next week are aimed at "give energy to volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The Control of Congress is so important for this agenda that the president is going to travel as far as possible to states as we approach the campaign's dedicated season," he said to Reuters a speaker for the Trump campaign that he wanted to name.
A date for the Arena of Wesbanco in Heeling, night demonstration can gather players from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump will be visiting West Virginia, the state that won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate of the Republican Senate of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is losing the survey.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to give him a boost in the survey," said Simon Hader, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US Team determined not to give up while approaching Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday's Foursomes could have just needed this Ryder Cup.
The momentum pendulum is a fully invented concept of sport but one in which players really believe, and never more than in such competitions.
So where do they say I'm the momentum now?
"These were in front with six points and are now four, so I think we're carrying it as a little momentum," said Jordan Swith as he left during the day.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, four front points with another twelve to play.
Americans, says Speth, feel but feel a little incessant and have a lot to encourage them, not at least the form of Swith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each of them open with three points from four.
Swimmed it was accurate from tea to green and running with an example.
That shout from the heart of celebration continued to grow as it continued its round, making a reputation crucial to bringing the fourth equal game when he and Thomas were two from under two.
His reputation who won the game on 15 was welcomed by a similar cry, the kind that tells you to believe that the American team is still there.
"Vera needs to go deep and worry about your own item," said Siepha.
This is what each of these players have missed now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points from Speth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fletwood, the incontestable history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but sweet couple are four and are considered perfect.
"Moliwood" was the only pair who didn't walk Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogies Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the nine after Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy is like walking both towards and from this life-form, establishes that they are the players who are offering the challenge Sunday, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun falls on Le Golf National from Fletwood or Mollinary.
Both preferably at once on different holes.
But here we are speaking of an earlier European glory.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson quickly completed by Sergio Garcia, the morning football hero, when he was placed in a pair with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the front side brought the Spanish and Swedish into a hole that they had never been able to come close to exit.
But Sunday, there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Foulballs and furosemes are very interesting to see closely because of peer interactions, their advice, their advice and the way in which a strategy can be changed into a second.
Europe has played better as a team so it has come and is at the forefront of the final day but this session of the Forums has also shown that the US Team has determined that some, especially on the US side, were doubting.
Europe front with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take good advantage of the final day of the Ryder Cup after it has been released from Saturday's front football and football parties with 10-6 on the US.
The inspired tommy Flotwood and Francisco Molinari made the two-winning effort on Tiger Woods that found it difficult to take their score so forward at the Golf National for four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, ready to keep the trophies that were lost in Hezeltine two years ago, dominated an American side that went wrong in the morning football, which took the 3-1 series.
The United States offered more resistance to the fourses, winning two parties, but could not reach the difference in score.
The side of Jim Furyk needed eight points from the 12th Sunday player item to hold the trophie.
Fletwood is the first new European for the season to win four successive points while he and Molinari, vaccinated "Molliewood" after a sensed hearing are only the second pair that won four of their four opening points in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After dominated by Woods and Patrick Red in the football then worked excellently to win Woods that did not appear optimistic and the new American player for the Bryson Dechambeau season with even more empathic score of 5&4.
Woods, who found difficulty in both parties on Saturday, showed occasional moments of brilliantness but now lost 19 of his 29 items in the football and fuursomes and seven behind each other.
Justin Rose, a spring for morning football, returned to Henrik Stanson's partner in the foursomes for a loss of 2&1 of Dustin Johnson and Koepka Brookes - which are classified first and third in the world.
However, nothing has happened as Europe wished on a beautiful day, with a slight spread in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Sieeth, a great winner for three times, and Justin Thomas established the threshold for Americans with two Saturday points.
They won a brave win of 2&1 on John Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the football and later returned to win Poulter and Roy McLroy with 4&3 in the foursmes after losing both opening holes.
It was only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team returned from a four-point difference while it was entering the singles, although the Furyk-sideholds need to learn to keep the trophies.
However, after being the second best for two days, against a Sunday attack seems to be more than they can do.
North Korea says that "in no way" is going to be unilaterally detached without confidence
The North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that the continued sanctions were deepening its lack of confidence in the United States and that there was no way that the country would leave its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Young Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world's body that North Korea had taken "considerable good will measures" last year, as it had stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site, and promised not to promote nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no way dissipate ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri repeated family complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phase" approach to denuclearisation in which North Korea would have been rewarded as it took steps gradually, its statement appeared significantly not to reject unilateral denuclearisation in the past as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Re refers to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a U.S. president performing his duties and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work towards the "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea was looking for a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said that Pyongyang first wants to cut its nuclear weapons.
Washington also protested calls to reduce hard international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "first denuclearisation" and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their objective in a coercive manner, and even objects to the "end-of-war declaration," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can break us is a dream of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions are deepening our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the part of this issue of denuclearisation was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a block."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the United States continental land with North Korean rockets was inevitable after the "Mr. Cati President" Trump called Kim "a man of rockets" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened to "completely overcome" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take steps to dismantle, but said that much work remained to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearised.
Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this, saying "If you take two, three years or five months - it doesn't make a difference."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Thursday, told the UN Security Council that: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council should continue vigorously and without stopping until we realize the fully and finally verified denuclearisation."
The Security Council unanimously strengthened the sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with a view to establishing funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said to return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July while he said that progress had been made, after in a few hours North Korea criticized him for making "gangster-like demands".
In a meeting with Mon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "corresponding measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a sufficient rest course
A new course at Harvard University this year has succeeded in making all its students who have not yet graduated fall asleep with a view to fighting the growing macho culture that is being studied all night and is still raised by caffeine.
An academic found that students at the university in the first place in the world often have no idea about the basic true things on how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he made a speech on the impact that sleeplessness had on learning.
"At last she was a girl on me and said, "Why are they saying this to me now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - that she surprised me," said The Telegraf.
The course, which started for the first time this year, explains to students the essential things about how good sleep traditions help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatric at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had serious insomnia during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a room where students sleep, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to relieve the effects of caffeine and light and on how athletic performance has a sleep-deficit effect, and the importance of routine sleep time.
In another section, participants are told how long-term insomnia may increase the risks of heart attacks, seizures, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive spots, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change students' behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know - as much as you have a right to know the effects on health when you choose to smoke cigarettes," added the Czeisler Prof.
The culture of pride that "successed you to stay awake all night to study" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that insomnia was a growing problem.
Ensuring that he sleeps sufficiently, and of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, intense tiredness and anxiety, he said - even to prevent weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a mode of hunger, which makes them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to insist on a course across the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students who have graduated to undertake a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students should consider making an alarm for going to sleep, as well as for getting up, and know about the harmful effects of "bluster" coming out of electronic screens and LED light, which can balance your circadian rhythm, and lead to problems sleeping.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Men of Gerard's Goal of Men
Ringers endured a further period of distress when they played abroad as Dolly Menga’s strike delivered the isolated side of Steven Gerard to a loss of 1-0 in Livingston.
The side of Ibrox was looking for a record of their first win while travelling from the June 4-1 victory of February at St Johnston, but the Gary Hold team caused only the second loss of Gerard in 18 items as a manager to leave his side eight points away from the major leaders of Ladbrokers Premiership, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time and the list of windless Ringers players never appeared to be going to be able to reach it.
While Ringers now go to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third and only after Hibernian on a difference of goul.
And there may be more trouble for Ringers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in his head after an object was apparently emptyed by the team supporters who played abroad.
Gerard made eight changes in the side that went through Ayr to the semi-ends of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Heats last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-trained form has constantly hindered their opponents.
Rangers could dominate the possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They had to run only two minutes from the start when the first time Menga's play-off sent Scott Pittman to a gowell of Allan McGregor but the midfielder took his great chance.
Strong Free-Kick of Keaghan Jacobs then found Craig Halket's skipper but his defending partner Alan Litgow could only walk away from behind.
Ringers achieved control but it seemed there was more hope than they believed about their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have had a penalence on the mark of fifteen minutes as he and Steven Lawless stood but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian appeals.
Ringers managed to target only two shores well in the first half of the item but the former goalker of Ibrox Liam Celly was hardly worried about the head of Lasana Coulibaly and the slight strike of Ovie Ejaia.
While Livi's first horse in 34 minutes could have been when the other team was playing better, no one could deny that they had only been punished for their effort.
Again, Ringers were unable to manage a good set-beece of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher wiped out the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga to end the action.
Gerard reacted to the brake by changing Culibly with Ryan Kent and the change almost provided an immediate impact as the wet Winger in Morellos but the impressive Kelly ran from his block line to block.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to play the exact kind of game he likes, with Lithgow and Halket who caught a long ball after a long ball.
The Holt side could extend their position to the front at the final stages but McGregor kept well to deny Jacobs before Litgow went to open the corner.
The replacement of Ringers Glenn Middleton had another late claim for penalty as he argued with Jacobs but again Thomson looked the other side.
Almanak: Geiger Contator Inventor
And now a page from our Almanac of "Sunday Morning": 30 September, 1882, like today 136 years ago, and WE LIVE... the day that the future physical Johns Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Giger developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Contator.
A science foundation since then has also become the foundation of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bels of Coronado", in which scientists come to see the unlikely cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "Is that some of the idols she is?"
Rogers: "That Geiger Contractor, used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.

A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are transformed into a laboratory
They can then "jell" a common protein for many cancers and then re-inject them.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, they are converted into a laboratory so that they can “jell” a common protein for many cancers called HER2, and the cells are then re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, U.S. Institute of National Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulating the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained the Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the uptake of immune cells by patients and how to "learn" how to target cancer cells worked to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West made a Verbal attack Fauvur Trump, while he was wearing a berry of MAGA, after his appearance on SNL.
This Is Not the Right Thing
Canye West was founded in the study during the Starday Night Live after a confusion performance in which U.S. President Donald Trump praised and said he would be released for the election in 2020.
After he sang his third night song, called Ghost Town in which he was a free dress of Make America Great, he began to speak against the Democratics and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I talk to a white person and say to me, "How can Trump please, what racist?"
Had you been concerned about racism, I had left America," he said.
SNL began the programme with a scrap of the comedy in which it appeared that Matt Damon, in which the Stable of Hollywood threatened the statement by Bert Kavanaugh before the Senate Judicial Committee on claims of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although he did not announce, West's video was posted on social media by social media journalist Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to make you laugh at West when he did.
In addition, West had complained with the audience that they had caught him after the weekend about his blessing.
"Bold me behind the scenes.
He said, "Don't go out there with that freelet."
Build me up!
Then they say that they lost," said, according to the Washington Exminr.
West continued: "You have to see the Christ? And he continued to say that he would've worn the cap of my prince, because this means that you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments started writing at least twice the audience and SNL's cast members appeared embarrassed, reported Variety, with one person there who said to the publication: "In all the study there was a big silence."
West brought him as a late replacement for the Ariana Grande cant, which the Boyfend she had, the Mac Miller rapper had died a few days ago.
West has touched many with the performance of the I Love it song, dressed as a Perier's bottle.
West had support from the president of the conservative group TPUSA, Canada Turner who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most courageous spirits: TRAINING THE FOLLE. "
But the presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply "what he is and this is something beautiful melens."
"But I have not chosen to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
So much so we," she added.
Before the programme, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now it was "what was previously known as Kanye West."
It is not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The previous rapper, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and of course the music legend that was no longer with us Prince, changed his name to a symbol then the artist who had previously been known as Prince.

The Game of Thrones Kit Harrington speaks of toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his role in filming the sword as John Snow in the series of violent violent media fantasy of HBO Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor spoke about the stereotype of the hero macho, saying that such roles on the screen mean that the audience often feels that they want to be violent to be respected.
Speaking with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and had doubts about how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old district of Game of Thrones Rose Lesley, also admitted to having "strong interests" to address the issue.
"Personally, I feel that I have a strong interest, right now--where did we go wrong with masculinity?" said he.
"What were we teaching men when they were growing, in terms of the problem we now have?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through its highly male characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes the audience feel that they want to be this certain side of a man?
I think this is one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because it is very clear that something went wrong for the jury."
The interview is also admitted that it will not make Game of Thrones prefectures or baskets when the series comes to an end the following summer, saying that "so war and horses".
Since November Kit will appear in the new production of True West of Sam Shepard which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a rock.
Recently, the actor revealed that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing he had ever seen out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this program, so this way gave me my future family, and my life thereafter," he said.
Rose interprets the part of Ygrite, the loving interest of Kit's character, John Snow, into the winning fantasy series in Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, say health officers.
In the second quarter of 2018 only some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people taking HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health officers at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV from sex is an acute problem in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was declared in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is said to be common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most transmissions of diseases result from sexual protection inadequately in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has revealed GOP yearner data, says "hazardous lies" and "confucous theories"
The representative of the United States Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that a member of its staff had posted the personal information of three U.S. Republicans on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Dimocate of Los Angeles ensured that the claims were being spread by foundations and websites of the "right hand ultra".
"Greeds, lies and more lies of the author," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information released allegedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers of the Utah and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah, Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate board on allegations of sexual misconduct against the nominated Supreme Court of Prema Bret Kavanaugh.
The disclosure was made at some time after the three years questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Fundit and Redstate reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and released the information of a staff member of Waters, reported the Hill.
"This baseless allegation is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – was in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
The Waters statement quickly attracted criticism online, including from the former press secretary of White House Ari Fleischer.
"This rejection is one of anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that it does not have the time to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
It shall not be resistant.
It shall not doubt the motives of the accused.
It shall be calm and sound."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing the response of Waters to the criticism of Prosecutors of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by the critics who appeared too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is going out to take the Waters chair in the mid-term elections, also mentioned his voice on Twitter.
"This is something great if it is true," he said on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned "the appropriate law enforcement authorities and entities about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that authors will be exposed," he continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their harmful and dangerous actions for each and all of my staff."
Critical of Johnny English Stricks Again - Rowan Atkinson, impotence of space
It is now traditional to look for meanings of Brexit in any new film with a British perspective and this seems to be applicable to the return of the franchise of the Johnny English action-community exercise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was relived in 2011 with Johannes English Reborn.
Is the iron autosateria on the subject of how bad we are of course, a new export opportunity for the country?
At any rate, the competitors Johnny English with large eyes and face-to-face movement as unusual had the renewed licence for a second time to do everything wrong - that is more than anything else shows that it is a widespread co-creating designed for territories of people who go to the cinema that do not speak English.
Of course he is the secret student agent who, despite his strange allegations to his sweet fascist, has some of Clouseau, a meeting of Mr. Bean and a large part of that man who contributed one note to the memory of the theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony in London.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international husband of a mystery who once had made his part in the advertisements of Barclaycard TV, today forgotten, after leaving a cave behind him.
There is a beautiful moment or two in this last issue of JE.
I liked the moment when Johnny English was approaching to an E.R. while he was wearing a medium-calculated clothes and the blades of the propellers caught with his helmet for a short time.
Atkinson's gift to the physical comedy appears, but humor is felt to be rather poor and extraordinaryly excessive, especially since film marks such as 007 and Myzon Impossible themselves offer the comedy as an ingredient in a confident manner.
Hormourism is seen as being aimed at children rather than adults, and for me the tragic unfortunate incidents of Johnny English were not as preventive and as focused as the silent film scene of Atkinson in the Bean characters.
The perennial topical offer now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the web network a very secret of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, to the disappointment of the agent who was on the job - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the crucifix on the cake for the prime minister that is a strange figure and with difficulties, which is already suffering from a complete collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this character like Teresa May but is not very much in the script to work.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active space has been compromised, someone will have to get retired.
And this means that the competitors Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in elected buildings, but gives non-official lessons on how to become an infiltrate operational: a few good laughs here as English offers a School of Rock-type spataemia.
English is taken back to Whitehall for emergency meetings and joins its former partner of great patience, Bogh, interpreted again by Ben Miller.
Bogh is now a married man, with a submarine commander, the role of one who has been buried interpreted by Vicki Pepperdine, in which she is a little loose.
In this regard, the Commission considers that the Commission considers that the measure is compatible with the internal market and that the measure is not compatible with the internal market.
In the meantime, the prime minister falls under the rule of the billion fresh technology that he claims can solve British computer problems: the Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bogh start their fun-farming trip: dressed as wipers, giving a high French restaurant a fire, creating caos to climb on Volta's luxury yacht; and English starts a full anarchy as they try to use virtual truth offices to familiarize themselves with Volta's home interior.
Of course all stops lead to that last sequence, but as amicable and as anonymous as it is, it has a little idea of a child's television.
Something quite moderate.
And like the other films of Johnny English I couldn't think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really deserves his talent?
The Labour refuses to prepare a plan for the British to work for a four-day week but is paid for five days
The German Corbyn Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that will see the British work for a week of four days - but will be paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the teacher of the companies to pass on the proceeds from the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to the workers by giving them another day of savings.
This would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend – but still taking the same wage with them.
Sources said that the idea would be "burning" with the economic agenda and plans of the party that the country switchs in favour of workers.
The shift to a week of four days has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way to take advantage of the changing economy.
Senior Officer of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "I expect a policy review to be announced before the end of the year.
"This will not happen today for tomorrow but a four-day work week is an inspiration that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the labour economy as well as the party's global industrial strategy."
The Labour Party shall not be the first to approve such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, the aspiration is currently not being approved by the entire Labour Party.
Speaker for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
Archbishop of Opposition John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from "anonymous directors" and "profitrs" in utility firms.
The opposition channel plans also mean that actual shareholders in water companies may not recover their entire share as soon as a Labour government can "deduction" on the basis of perceived misconduct.
It also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Share Funds to give 10 per cent of the equity of private sector firms to employees, who are willing to take annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy say to "60 Minutes" if the Kavanaugh FBI investigation can change their mind
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Bret Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by week, raising the question whether the findings of the Borao can influence any Republican governor to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senate John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Take it, and be sure," said Kennedy.
"I said and I went to the hearing, said, spoke to Judge Kavanagh.
I said after this happened, after having issued that allegation, I said, "Did you do it?"
He was resolved, determined, impotent."
However, Graham's vote seems difficult to change.
"I've already decided about Bert Kavanagh and must be a very big accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bert flattened her," he added Graham, while referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And any person you mention cannot verify this.
It is 36 years old.
I didn't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Do Something to Reduce Poverty?
The next Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a very impressive list of stars that will appear and an equally impressive mission; to end world poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people release it to the Wall of Central Park to not only enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sne Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Governance Project, a representation group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay a VIP ticket), those going to the concert had to finish a series of tasks, or "actions" such as a volunteer, send an e-mail to a world leader, make a call or some other significant way to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how well has the remaining 12-year Global Citizen achieved its objective?
The idea of rewarding people free of charge is a genuine way of convincing people to ask for a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clictivism" - do people feel that they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a TV?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says that it has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its employers, which I stand for a number of different objectives.
This says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies that are equivalent to more than $37 billion that are expected to affect lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announced its actions, at least $10 billion of which were already traded or collected.
The group estimates that safe funds have so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the clock.
Some of the key commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "help children grow to their full potential", promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after they received more than 4,700 pounds from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the United Kingdom's government, donors, national governments, and citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Trade UK to the crowd during a direct conference in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to invite the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequent questions on his website to ask "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "Ser would be a long and hard journey -- sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like large movements of civil rights and anti-partheid, we will succeed, because we have more power when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Srene Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the artists who will appear at this year's event in New York, which will present him with Deborra-Le Burns and Hugh Jackman.
US uses Naval Fleet for "block" to hinder Russian energy exports - Internal Secretariat
"If necessary", Washington may resort to its Naval Fleet to prevent Russian energy from affecting the markets, including the Middle East, has revealed the United States Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's enlargement in Syria - especially, where it is operating with a legitimate government invitation - is an excuse for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, Southern Europe," he allegedly said.
And, according to the officer, there are ways and means of addressing this.
"The US has the ability, with our Naval Fleet, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy has not reached the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing those who attended the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that called itself the "energy consumer voice" in the US.
It continued to compare the Washington approaches in addressing Russia and Iran, noting that these are effectively the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, little or too, the leverage and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "anyone with a single ability" with an economy dependent on carbon fuels.
The following statements are made as Trump's administration was on a mission to strengthen its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, with a much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of Trump's administration, including the President of the United States Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to exit from the "inappropriate" gas project Nord Stream 2, which according to Trump, made Berlin the "silver" of Moscow.
Moska has repeatedly claimed that the Nord Stream 2 gas of $11 billion, which is expected to double the existing gas input capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
Kremlin argues that the intense opposition of Washington to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s main organisation for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), invited the US to stay away from Europe’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between the German Canary Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Ser "Examine Black" If you go to President in 2020, Say the Senator of Masachussets
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said that Saturday will "well examine" whether you will go to a president after the mid-term elections.
At a meeting of the council in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that it would consider going out.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government and this includes a woman in the highest position," said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will examine whether I will go out for a president."
Warren commented about President Donald Trump during the council meeting, saying that he was taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I am very worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was directly involved in Trump's criticism and his nomination to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In a week ago, Warren said "naturally we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey released on Thursday, showed that a majority of Waren’s own constituents do not think it should be issued for the election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" votes of Masachussets said that the yearner should not be elected, according to the survey of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Centre.
Thirty-two percent supported the election issue.
The survey showed more support for the election outlet by former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 per cent who supported and 48 per cent against potential elections.
Other high profile democratic names discussed with regard to potential exits for the 2020 election include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said to officially decide by January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin refers to the PTSD of Track Palin in the demonstration of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent one year in Iraq after being registered in September
He was arrested and brought forward on an incident of domestic violence on the night of Monday.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after his return, I can relate to other families who feel the radicals of the PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers will return with," told the audience in a demonstration for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest as "the obvious problem that no one is addressing" and said about her son and other war victims, "they return a little different, they return stronger, they wonder if there is that respect for what other soldiers like them and air staff, and every other member of the military, gave the country."
He was arrested in Wasila, Alaska, and has been subjected to an attack of domestic violence against a woman, while he interfered with a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons while he was a tourist, according to Dan Bennet, speaking to the police department of Wesilla.
18 states, D.C. supports a challenge for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District are supporting a legal challenge to a new US policy to deny asylum to victims fleeing from gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and districts, the week submitted a case of a court friend in Washington to support an asylum-seekers challenging the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the actor in the case of Grace versus Sexes which the US Civil Liberties Union put forward in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and the boys members of his violent gang," abused her but the U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
It was kept in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum applicants in the US, as nations are facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has been reversed by a 2014 decision by the Board of Appeal of Migrants which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Friday, in a statement, the Attorney General of the District of Colombia Karl Racine, said that the new policy "embarks decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all requests for asylum to be judged on the facts and particular circumstances of the claim, and such a motive infringes this principle, said the case of a friend of the court.
The lawyers continued to argue in the event that policies to deny income to immigrants harm the US economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sexsons ordered the immigration judges to cease granting asylum to victims fleeing from domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," said the Seminars in his policy announcement on 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all problems -- even all serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts in Palau as the number of deaths doubles in the fight against time to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become increasingly terrible.
"It was very intense," said 35-year-old Risa Kousuma, while she was taking her son with a fever in an evacuation centre in the hearty city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulance brings the bodies.
The clean water is scarce."
The residents seemed to return to their destroyed homes, looking in their water-stricken things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, destroyed by the 7.5-sized earthquake, were too full.
Some of the injuries, including Duwi Harris, which suffered fractures in the back and shoulder, remained outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to continued strong shocks.
His eyes filled with tears as he reported that he felt the violent earthquake moving the hotel floor in the fifth floor he was using with his wife and daughter.
"There was no chance of saving ourselves.
I crushed with the remains of the wall, I think," Harris told Associated Press, and added that his family was in place for a wedding.
"I heard my wife shouting for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "bulling" with "propaganda adverts"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper, an advert was published on four pages in a US newspaper released daily trying to sell the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador for China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to China Daily's paid supplement in the De Moines Register - the newspaper that is sold mostly in the state of Ioa - after he charged China that it was seeking to interfere with the US Congress elections of 6 November, accusing China of rejecting it.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections marked what United States officials told Reuters that was a new phase in a campaign which was closing in Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to make advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an ongoing trade war that they have seen passing tariff rounds on imports of each of them.
The Chinese import prices from China at the beginning of the commercial war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Ioa which supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Brand, the US ambassador for China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a leading exporter of agricultural goods for China, said that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Brandtad on an opinion page in the Sunday's des Moines Register, "now doubles this pool by making propaganda advertising in our own free press."
"In the dissemination of its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the loving tradition of America of free expression and free press by placing a paid advert in the De Moines Register," wrote Brandtad.
"In contrast, on the press stand down on the road here in Beijing, you will find limited voices of dissemination and you will not see a true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's problematic economic transition, since the media are under a restriction of the Chinese Common Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish" in his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
The Republics are preventing Women's Voters prior to the Middle-Temporary Elections with the Kavanaugh Debate, alert the Analysts
As many Republicans of the top are supporting and defending the nomination of the Supreme Court Bret Kavanagh while facing several allegations of sexual attack, analysts have warned that they will see an adverse reaction, particularly during the forthcoming mid-term elections.
The views on this were very high, and most Republicans are already officially showing that they wanted to vote.
These things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that the last minute push of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation will be sufficient to calm angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday – they won't forget it tomorrow nor November," said Karen Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national speakers for the progress group MoveOn Friday, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
Friday morning, the demonstrators sang "Next November!" as they protested in the Senate hall as Republics controlling the Judicial Committee decided to lead the designation of Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, reported Mike.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high, said Stu Rothenberg, a non-participative political analyst to the news site.
"People are saying that they were already high; and true.
"But they may be higher, in particular between female voters who turn to smaller subbours and voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, while not pleasing the president, often do not vote."
The President of the Supreme Court, acting on behalf of the President of the Republic, stated that the President of the Supreme Court, acting on behalf of the President of the Republic, is responsible for the conduct of an adverse reaction.
"This has become a full mix-up for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"This does not only concern the committee's vote or the final vote on whether Kavanawagh is put on the bank, it also concerns the way the Republics handled this situation and how they handled it," indicated to the news station Guy Cecil, a director of the USA Priorities, a group that helps to elect the Democrats.
However, Americans appear to be in some way divided over believers in the light of Ford and Kavanagh's statements, with little more support for the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed the Ford's statement, while 35 percent said that they definitively or probably believed the Ford's statement.
In addition, 38 per cent said that they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitively lied in his statement, while 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
Following the push by Falke, the FBI is currently investigating allegations submitted by Ford as well as at least another accused, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her while he was a tourist at the age of 17.
Ramírez alleged that the Supreme Court’s nomination exposed its geneticist to her while they were in Festin when they were studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Inventor plans to launch a New Internet to compete against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Le, the World Wide Web Inventor, will launch a new business seeking to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Berners-Le open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Le welcomed that the intention behind Inrupt is "domination of the world."
"We want to do it now," said he about the new business.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their "personal online data shop" or OOD.
This may include contact lists, lists of what to do, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spopify are all available on one browser and all at the same time.
What makes a single online personal data shop is that it is completely in the hands of the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal autonomy through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the John Bruce company’s CEO, is for the company to bring resources, process skills and appropriate skills to make Solid available for all.
The company currently consists of Bernards-Le, Bruce, a security platform brought by IBM, some staff developers who have a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteers.
By starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Bernards-Le said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they should introduce a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down tomorrow.
"We do not pray for their permission."
"Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Le transformed the Internet when it established a World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Bernards-Lee has been a voice of influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Le will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm an extremely optimistic performer for this next time of the web," added Bernards-Le.
Bernard Van: Clerical celebration of the Cross of World War I Victoria
The only clerical of the Church of England that won Victoria Cross during World War I as a rival was celebrated in his village 100 years later.
Lt Col. The Reverend Bernard Van won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack in Belenglise and Lehaukourt.
However, he was killed by four days later and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
Saturday a commemorative stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren in a parapet in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that it was "blariously symbolic" that the stone had to be revealed exactly 100 years after the victory of the reward of his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, the Lt Kor led his battle across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in many fogs and fire from rifles on the ground and machine gons."
Later he rushed to the fire line and with "the greatest courage" led the line forward before he went to a rifle on the spot alone and lost consciousness three of the troops.
Lt Kor was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just one month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72 years old, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never get there but something very humiliating."
He and his brother Dr James Van also put a girland after the paraparat, which was led by the Brentwood Empire Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "is feeling very honoured that he played a role in this parable" and added "the courage of a genuine hero was being demonstrated by the support to be given by many people."
MMA supporters remained awake all night to see Bellator 206, instead of ending up with Peig Peg Peppa
Imagine this, I remained up all night to see a 206-packed Bellator to end up denied seeing the main event.
The list by San José included 13 fights, including six on the main card and were being shown direct overnight in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
On 6am, as Gerard Mousasi and Roy MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK remained confused when the broadcast was changed to Pepa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they had been raised to early hours especially to fight.
One Party on Twitter described the change to children's cartons as "some kind of crazy joke."
"It is a government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was not so appropriate that they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of Bellator's marketing and communication, when asked about transmission.
"Peppa the island," yes."
The president of the company Belator Scott Coker said that they will work on their schedule to include future viewers from the United Kingdom.
"I think when I think about repetition, we probably can sort something out," said Coker.
"But now there are the six o'clock on Sunday morning and we will not be able to arrange until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we are working on it.
From me, when the broadcast was turned, there were many messages going on and not all were sweet.
We were trying to fix the solution, thinking it was a technical mistake.
But it was not, it was a governmental matter.
I can promise you that the next time will not happen.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to deliver it more to the parties and instead to over-invasion.
It's a desperate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dally felt "less" due to sex
The Olympic number Tom Dally says that he has grown to feel inferior to all because of his sex - but it has given him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said that he had not realized until he went to the secondary that "not everyone like me."
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he became less concerned with the Olympics than with winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-standing programme, Kirsty Young, took a few months away due to illness.
While it appeared as a man set aside on Laverne's first programme, Dally said that he felt "less than anybody else" he was growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to please you boys and girls."
He said, "To date, those emotions that feel less than, and feel different, were the true things that gave me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something", said, not to disappoint everyone when they eventually get to know about his sexuality.
The two-fold Olympic bronchial mealist has become a high profile promoter for LGBT and has used his appearance in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to criminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt fortuitous that he could live freely without pain and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world winner for three times said that when he became a man - a film producer from the United States Dustin Lance Black - he met him in 2013 - she was "surprising" him.
Dally married the winner of Oscar, who is 20 years older than he, last year but said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When passing through so many things of such a young age – he went to his first Olympics of 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later – he said that it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar good experiences and coaches.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Dally, and Dally said that his "all-view" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, for me the important thing was that 'I want to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 40 years after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dally said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the things he had asked was if they had already had the tickets for London 2012 - since he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't say to him, 'You won't be here to be in the front row, pà," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and was not until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally recognized that he was not inconvincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the brunch.
"I knew that this was what I dreamed of all my life -- that I put a crowd of countries in the Olympic Games, there was no feeling better," he said.
It also inspires the first choice of his song - Heather Small's Proud - which was compatible with him in the course of the Olympics and still has the cold.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mikkelson no longer in form remains on the bank in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mikkelson will make a record on Saturday when he plays his 47 game of the Ryder Cup, but will have to change his shape to avoid being an important step not so happy.
Mikkelson, who plays at the biennial event for a record of 12 times, stayed on the bank by master Jim Furyk for Saturday’s football and photosomes.
Instead of being the centre of action, as it was often for the United States, the five-fold great winner shared his day between being sustained and working on his game from the distance with the hope of correcting what he was worried about.
One who would never have given the ball right even in the interior of his career, the 48-year-old man is not ideal for the difficult course of Le Golf National, where the long distance was damaged once again to punish wrong shutters.
And if the course alone is not enough to cut off the heart, Michelson, in the ninth game Sunday, faces the exact ride of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who joins Tommy Fletwood, new to the season, to win all four games this week.
If Americans, with four points less than the beginning of the 12 single games, start well, the Mikkelson game can show that it is a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had played today, tap it on my back and put his arms around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"We have a lot of confidence in himself.
It is Hall of Famer and has contributed greatly to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably did not want to play two parties.
I've seen more, but this is the way it worked and this is the way we thought it would go.
He must be out there, like everyone else."
Mikkelson will exceed the record of Nick Faldo for the most parts of the Ryder Cup played Sunday.
This can mark the end of a trailer of the Ryder Cup that has never quite reached the millenniums of its individual record.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half, although Furyk said that his presence brought some intangible things to the team.
"He takes you in, heterosexual, funny, he likes to laugh with people, and a very good man you have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players were happy to criticize him, this week, which was something fun to see.
It provides much more than just games."
European master Thomas Bjorn who can quickly disappear the big front
Thomas Bjorn, the European master, knows from experience that a position on a front scaled before the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily change into a comfortable journey.
The Danish made its debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, where one side led by Seve Balesteros maintained an advantage of five points on the Americans but ended up with a genuinely narrow margin, with a victory of 1411⁄2-131⁄22.
"You will continue to remind yourself that we had a big front position in Valderrama; we had a great lead position in Brockline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a little," said Bjorn, in the picture, after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both Friday and early morning to be on a 10-6-year-old at the Le Gold National.
This is why history will show me and everyone in this team that has not finished everything yet.
Tomorrow you go with your soul and body.
Get out there and do all the right things.
It is not yet over until you have pulled the points on the team.
We have a purpose, and what we try to hide this trophie, and the focus will stay there.
I've always said, I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we know well what the other side is -- the biggest players in the world."
Thought as his players played on a rough golf track, Bjorn added: "Never go step oltrè from me in this.
A different challenge remains.
It still concerns the individual performances we see, which is something different to do.
It is very nice to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when there is out individually, then it is tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message that you want to pass on to the players, which comes out your best tomorrow.
Now, leave the partner behind and he wants to leave and get his best out, too."
In contrast to Bjorn, the opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to play better individually than when they did as partners, with the exceptions that they are Jordan Swith and Justin Thomas, who acquired three points from four.
Furyk himself was on the two sides of those last days that could change everything, after being part of the winning team in Brockline before a terrorist ended as Europe made the "Midinah Miracle".
"I remember at least a word of it," said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, master in 1999, prepared his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important items, but you want to give him to that early start as I saw in Brockline, as I saw in Medinah.
When that momentum reaches one side, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle parties.
We made our list as appropriate and put those men in the way we felt, you know, we are trying to do a few miracles tomorrow."
Thomas had been given the task of trying to lead the fight back and facing Roy McLroy in the best game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, tommy Fletwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the best half of the order.
"I went with this group of men in this way because I think it's all the way," said Bjorn about his singles choices.
Germany's new war postponed again
The German Naval Fleet's newest patent had to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old War-Berda time frames, but there will not be until at least next year due to systems with increasing defects and cost, reported to the local media.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Frammers of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a speaker for the military.
The vessel had to join the Naval Fleet in 2014, but the post-delivery problem issues set the target of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels that ordered the Naval Fleet back in 2007 will come as a replacement for old Bremen class fairs.
It is understood that they will have strong cannons, an exhibition of missiles against aeroplanes and against ships as well as some catalytic technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic synthesis.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods – this should be possible to operate the newest fairies up to two years away from home ports.
However, continued delays mean that the vessels of the last technology – mentioned to allow Germany to project power outside its shores – will already be old to old when they enter service, note Die Zeit.
F125 of bad suffering appeared on the news last year, when the German Naval Fleet officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to Blohm & Vos Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Naval Fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after it arrived.
Little was known about the reasons for this, but German media quoted a number of key "software and hardware defects" that made the ship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessel will be operated by a crew of about 120 seamen - only half of the workers on the older Bremen class fairs.
In addition, it appeared that the ship has a very heavy burden to reduce its performance and limit the ability of the Naval Fleet to increase future updates.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tonnes is understood to be twice as heavy than the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the whole project – including crew training – is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached an alarming amount of €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - from an initial €2.2 billion.
The problems of the newest traffickers become especially important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament defence committee, acknowledged that the Naval Fleet currently "has a shortage of ships capable of deployment."
The officer said that the problem grew over time, because old ships were commissioned but replacement vessels were not provided.
He complained that none of the Barden-Wuerttemberg class framers could join the Naval Fleet.
National Trust is mentioned on the secret life of the bats at night
New ground research in the Scottish Higlands aims to reveal how the bats use the landscape when looking for food.
It is hoped that the findings will show a new light on the behaviour of single mammals flying and helping to guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists in the National Trust for Scotland will follow common pipistreles and soprano as well as long-eared brown-eyed bats and Daubenton in the Invere Gardens in Western Ross.
Special prescriptions will be put in key locations around the property to track the activities of the bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
An expert analysis of the noise of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of the calls of the bats at night and which species is doing what.
Then a habitat map will be produced and a report will create a detailed picture of their landscape scale of behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of pastures and how best to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats at night in Scotland and across the UK has decreased considerably over the last century.
They are under threat from building and development work affecting buildings and habitat losses.
Wind and light turbines can also pose a risk, as can poison paper to catch insects and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are currently not blind.
However, because of their notional hunting traditions their ears are more useful than their eyes when they come to catch prey.
They use sophisticated eco-locality techniques to indicate insects and obstacles in their passage.
NTS, which is responsible for the treatment of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, house inspections and sometimes rescue.
The organisation has even established the first and only reserve of Scotland's bats on the Terreve ground in Dumfries and Galloway, which hosts eight of the ten species of bats on the night of Scotland.
The owner of David Thompson states that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"It's in Treave we have a very good area for the bats tonight," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veterani trees and the whole good habitat.
But there is much more about the still unknown bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
It stresses the importance of checking the bats for the maintenance of properties as it is possible that unintended destruction of a single maternity home can kill up to 400 women and young people, possibly destroying a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, torment them or trouble them or destroy their houses.
Elizabeth Ferrel, a Scottish Officer for the Rest of the Conservation of Nightfare, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We don't have much to learn about our bats tonight and for most of our species we still don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape as the lawyers are willing to seek a German magazine
Cristino Ronaldo pointed out claims of rape against him as "false news," by saying that people "must promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are expected to search court for the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The player of Portugal and Juventus playing front was accused of spying an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He alleged that then he had paid her $375,000 to not say anything about the incident, reported Dr. Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking on a video on Instagram Live with his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, noted the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the winner of Ballon d'Or five times while he looked in the camera.
"We want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They must become famous to say my name, but this is part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's going well," the player added, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to search court to Der Spiegel about allegations, which they called "inadmissible reporting of privacy suspicions", according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz said that the player sought compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident was reportedly carried out in June 2009 in a room at the Hotel and Casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting in Discoteca, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly took it from the Anus, according to documents submitted at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his relapse after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 per cent" "well man" disappointed by "one per cent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that both had sexual involvement, but that this was by consensus.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to a solution outside the court because she felt "sawed by retaliation" and was worried that "it was publicly lenient."
The 34-year-old wife says that she is now seeking to switch the solution as soon as she is being traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo had come to join Real Madrid by Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he went with the Italian football legends Juventus in an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "failing it forever" lost car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "deploys it forever" if it loses its status as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "a concern" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, it temporarily stopped production at its factory in Burnston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of delays at the borders in the case of Brexit of no agreement would be costly for jobs.
The Burnaston plant - making Auris and Avensis of Toyota - produced almost 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March we will see a stop in production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota's management in Burnston.
Other UK manufacturers raised fears about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, states that it will close its Mini plant for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the case of Brexit of no agreement.
Toyota's production line today works on a "accurate in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for cars made in order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be border disruptions that industry says may lead to delays and failure of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep an inventory of more than one day at its Derbyshire plant, said the company, and therefore production would be stopped.
Mr Clark says that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "accurately calibrated to prevent these border controls."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement to allow, as I say, not only success to enjoy it at present but to seize this opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4 Today's programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we need to be absolutely able to continue what was a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say for how long production has been stopped, but in a longer period, it warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsuvalaris, who worked in Burnston for 24 years and is the defendant of the United Union at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience when these jobs leave, never return.
A government speaker said: "We have submitted a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The Trump meeting with Rosentein can be delayed again, says White House
The risky meeting of Donald Trump with the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosnestein can "be delayed by another week" as the fight on the nomination of the Supreme Court was continued, said White House Sunday.
Rosentin oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Müller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump aid and Russia and a potential obstruction of justice by the president.
If Trump is going to rob the Deputy General Counsel or not, thereby jeopardising the independence of Mueller, he has called Washington's affidavits for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosentein discussed wire clothes to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by means of 25 amendments.
Rosensitisin rejected the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, although there were reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then the United Nations in New York, scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said that it "prefers not" does not expel Rosentein but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid misbehaviour with the hearing of the Senate judicial committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blaise Ford, both of whom gave their testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a weekly claim investigation against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote of the Senate.
On Sunday, the press secretary of Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When she was asked about the Rosentein meeting, she said: "No date has been set for this, it may be this week, and the following week may be due to all other affairs going on with the supreme court.
But now we see and I always love to keep the picture up-to-date."
Some journalists challenge this assertion: Sanders have not held a press meeting in the White House since 10 September.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of meetings was not due to a lack of grace with TV journalists "to try to attract and influence the audience", although she said: "Although I agree with the fact that they try to attract and influence the audience."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the picture would increase.
"The president does more questions and answers sessions compared to any president who agreed," she added without quoting any evidence: "Look at those numbers."
The meetings will still be held, said Sanders, but "if the picture has the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, this is far better than to talk to me.
We try to do this a lot and you've seen us do it many times in the last few weeks and this will replace the press meeting where one can speak to the president of the United States."
Trump rarely answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences when visiting dignity.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he behaves calmly and sometimes strangely before groups of journalists.
Health secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit-related fears
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the gratitude and desire of the country that they remain there after Brexit.
Jane Freeman MSP sent a letter when less than six months remained for the United Kingdom to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to the cost of status applications defined for EU citizens working in its evolving public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the issue, moving towards decisions expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government was also increasing its preparations for a possible scenario of no agreement.
I know this is certainly an unstable time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to insist now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, irrespective of their nationality.
Fellows from across the EU, and beyond, bring with them valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and are beneficial to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely home and we want you very much to stay here."
Crission Abercrombie Makes Emergency surgery After suffering an injury in Rasu
The linebacker Crisis Abercrombie of Tennessee State Tiggers performed emergency surgery after suffering an injury in the head of Saturday when his team lost against the Vanderbilt Committees by 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The main Bureau of the State of Tennessee Rod Red told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the half time.
"He went on the side line and like he fell there," said Red.
The trainer and medical staff gave oxygen to Abercrombie on the side line before putting it on a sticker and took it later for further examination.
In this regard, the Commission considers that the Commission considers that the measures provided for in this Decision constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
Harris adds that "so far there is no detail on the type/extend of the injury" and the Tennissee State is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in the second year of the university suspended, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after he left Illinois.
The Saturday in all he had five tackles before leaving the game, which led to a total of 18 tackle of his season.
Foreign buyers will be required to pay more toll tax when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be required to pay more toll tax when buying property in the UK with extra money is used to help homeless people under new Tory plans
This change will neutralise Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in ball tax will be imposed on non-taxpayers in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects it to rise to £120 million a year - to help homeless people
Today Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers should pay a higher rate of ball tax when buying property in the United Kingdom – with extra money used to help homeless people.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and target those who earn a higher wage.
The increase in ball tax will be imposed on non-taxable individuals and firms in the UK, with extra money boosting the Government's efforts to fight road sleep.
The additional payment - which is additional to the current ball tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second houses and rental purpose purchases - could be three percent.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to £120 million per year.
According to the UK authorities, the Commission considers that the aid is compatible with the internal market in the form of State aid.
Many rich areas of the country – particularly in the capital – have become "fantasm cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending much of their time abroad.
The new policy came out just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the ball tax so that more young people would be helped to buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms that were maintaining high property prices by taking over land and not using it, and urged Ms May to abandon allowances on affordable houses to correct the "housing shame situation" in the United Kingdom.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed housing reforms that hit the eye, including rent checks and the end of "no fault" dismissals.
He must also give the councils great powers to build new houses.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said that I will devote my office to restoring the United Kingdom's dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And this means arranging the broken market for our housing.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and earn their lives here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, find it easy to buy houses as much as the UK's very large residents.
For many people the dreams of having a home have become too remote, and the indidiability of sleeping on the streets remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland"
The head of Sanderland Jack Ross says that his "fundamental ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland once.
The 42-year-old Scottishs welcome the challenge of re-launching the North East Club, which is currently in third place in the League One, with three points different from the one in the first place.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after guiding St Mirren back to the Iscuttish Premiership in the last season.
"I'm playing for countries as a player.
I found B cap and nothing more," Ross said to Sportson of the BBC of Scotland.
"But when I was still a child, I often went with my father to see Scotland play in Hampden, and it always remains that thing that drew me back.
However, this opportunity will come only if I succeed in managing a club."
Former managers of Sanderland include Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says that he was not concerned about the fact that he would follow such established names in such a large club, while he had previously rejected the offer from the City of Barnsley and Ipswich.
"At present, success for me will be based on 'I can't get this club again for President League'?'
Given the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that this club belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I probably consider it successful here only if I succeed in taking the club back there."
Ross has been in his career as manager for only three years, after a period of assistant head in Dumbarton and after spending 15 months with Heats’ coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from the regex for the third category, and transformed St Mirren from the edge of the regex to the winners of the Campionate title the following season.
And Ross says that now he feels more comfortable than he felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
As for the time when Alloa took over, he recalled that "it was probably a big change."
"I was perfectly thinking that the position of manager was the most appropriate one for me, much more than that of a player.
This may sound strange by going well, having a decent living, and enjoying some reasonable achievements.
But games can be difficult.
There are many things you get through every week.
Still I experience this in terms of stress and work pressure but I just feel that the position of manager is right for me.
I always wanted to manage and now I am doing it, and I feel that throughout my adult life I now feel the most comfortable."

Survey finds that the best time to take a beer pin is 5.30pm in the evening
The summer heat wave has boostd the earnings of the UK public in difficulty but increased pressure on the restaurants of the same company.
In July, parties and barges saw a 2.7 per cent increase in sales – but figures revealed that the return on restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, an advisory CGA for businesses, who collected the figures, said: "The constant and longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar model for the previous month of June, when sales in the public increased by 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were even more affected.
The reduction of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trade in June continued to worsen in July.
The main sales of apples and bars were those that went best in terms of the financial results compared to the previous period while the sales of restaurants decreased.
People whose main sales are food have also suffered in the heat, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
People seem to want to just go out drinking.
The sale of beverages was increased by 6.6 per cent per month in books and bars, while food dropped to 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, one of RSM's analysts regarding entertainment and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors in terms of the marketing of take-aways.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent year after year will be particularly burdensome in addition to constant cost pressures.
The warm and long summer could not come at a worse time for operators whose main sales are food and only time can advise us whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much needed rest."
The growth of total sales in publishers and restaurants, including the opening of new businesses, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow pace of start-up of new businesses.
The monitoring of the sales of the United Kingdom Coffer Peach Tracker industry for the printing, bar and restaurant sector gathers and analyses the performance data from 47 operational groups, with combined revenues of more than £9 billion, and is the established industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts hidden from their parents
Survey reveals that one in five children – some of them young 11 - have secret social media accounts hidden from their parents and teachers
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the "Insta crowd" pages
The news has great fears of being posted sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "core" account to show their parents
One in five children – some of them 11 years of age – are creating social media accounts hidden from adults.
Surveys of 20,000 secondary school students revealed rapid growth in the "Insta crowd" accounts - a reference to the site for the sharing of Instagram photos.
The news has great fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said to operate a "core" account presented to show their parents, while having other private ones.
A mother who met her 13-year-old girl's secret site found a young woman who was encouraging others to rape her - "Suppose me."
Research, by Digital Access UK and the Headmasters and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of young people 11 to 18 years of age had two profiles, half of whom admit to keeping private accounts.
The head of HMC Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that many young people are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eliidh Doyle will become the "voting for athletes" on the Scottish athletic board
Eliidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish athletic board as non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most athlete of the course and not the racer who won the medals and president Ian Beattie described this change as a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from its vast experience at international level over the past decade.
"Elidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletic community and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by becoming part of the board," said Bettie.
Doyle said: "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and hope that I can contribute really well and help to lead sport in Scotland."
The United States, which won the 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Games in Atlanta among its total of four Olympic Games gold medals and which is now a regular BBC critical, ended up not moving after suffering from a small stroke attack.
On Twitter he wrote: "For today you gave me a stroke.
I couldn’t walk.
Doctors said that only time can advise us whether or not I recover or to what extent.
It was a beat but I got back completely, I learned how to breathe again and today I am doing an exercise of agility!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump reflux comparing mothers to cows gives rise to different opinions online
A breast pump company has given rise to different opinions online with advertising comparing breast-feeding mothers to cattle being added.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered to be "the first non-smoking breast pump in the world", the consumer technological company Elvie issued an announcement inspired by an iron music video to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers who use the breast pump.
Four real mothers bury in a matma full of cattle' straw with a disc including lyrics such as: "Yes, I swear to myself but have no tail" and "In case I don't think they're a pig but a pig."
The corus continued: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm begging my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my women."
However, the advertising published on the company Facebook page caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, the video received different reactions from viewers, many of which say it lights on the milk industry's "terror".
Somebody wrote "It was a very bad decision that cows are used to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken within a few days of giving birth".
Elvie breast pump stays in a breast-feeding bar without being in the eye (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else commented: "One understands this is a traumatic thing for both mother and baby.
But why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?
Someone else added: "Rikam really cut off from reality."
Others defended the advertising, with a believing woman who found the disc "very fun."
"I think this is a genetic idea.
If I had been breastfed, I would have bought one.
The pumping would make me feel the same as a cow.
The advertising is some little or too crazy but I have taken it of it.
This is a genetic product," wrote someone.
Someone else commented: "This is a fun advertising aimed at mothers who pump (often on their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like "honeys".
This is not an advertising that praises or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video the group of women revealed that all of them were suffocating with the pumps that did not give in the eye placed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who hold their chests say they feel like cattle.
However, Elvie Pump, does not make any noise, has no wire or tube and sits in a breast-feeding bar without giving it into the eye, thus giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even leave while they are pumping.
Anna Balarin, a partner and ECD in Mother commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutional product that he deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing the women using the breast pump with the dairy cows we want to focus on breast pumping and all the challenges it brings, while showing in a way that is fun and related to it, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time that Elvie pump appeared on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the catalogue for the designer Marta Jacobowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Spoken towards the Tnda Camp at the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has increased sharply despite the fact that the monthly border crossing has not changed much, partly because a historical and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult for children to be placed with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and they feared that if they presented themselves to care for a child they would endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their poultry would have to submit fingerprints, and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or home members of sponsors are found here illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
We are therefore continuing to search for these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to speed up the process involving children, officials have introduced new rules which will require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, instead of after 60 days, which was the previous standard, depending on the elector workers.
Many will appear via a video conference, rather than in person, to bring their case to legal status with an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for aid will be transferred immediately.
According to trigger workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the more children are kept under custody, the more likely they become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent expression or attempt to escape.
Counsel said that these concerns would increase in a larger facility such as Turnilllo, where signs that a child would be finding difficult are more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the town of tents without giving enough time to be emotionally prepared or without saying strength to their partners could lead to trauma that many of them are already fighting.
Syria tells the "occupational forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
While addressing the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moalem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country's war is now in its eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as a deputy minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory, making excuses for the fight against terrorism, and "will be addressed accordingly."
"They shall withdraw immediately and without any condition," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more being moved from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue "to fight this sagra battle until we are expelled from all Syrian territories" both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, many of whom train and advise both the Kurdi forces and the Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in the land in the country destroyed by war.
With regard to the refugee issue, Moualem said that the conditions were good for them to return, and he affixed "in some Western countries" for "striking fears" that led the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicising what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last strong major rebel of Ilblj created an opportunity to continue the political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces supported by Russians on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target the Israelis including the fighters from the Nosra Front linked to Al-Qaida, which would "be destroyed".
The UN sender Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene shortly the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and of the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be restricted "for the revision of the current articles of constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Mandate
With this logic, in 2020 Mr Trump will win the re-election provided that, as many liberal viewers are hoping, the denunciation and the scandal end his pre-residence.
What will undoubtedly be "The most dramatic final ever there has been in a presidency!"
So far, it appears that the viewers have not yet been sold.
Since 2014, time ratings with the largest number of telescopes have increased by more than double to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in time with the largest number of viewers, more than 1.7 million of four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Midlow Show" increased cable television ratings with even 3.5 million telescopes on the nights of the main news.
"This is a situation that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Barer, presenter of the ABC drama programme "Designed Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a writer of the Veteran comedies and author of "Just the Funy Parts: And one of the Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr Trump.
asked her.
"He said, "Why don't you take me," she said to me Mrs. Scovell.
In this caos there is a value of entertainment.
Contrary to anything else on TV, stories coming from Washington can undoubtedly determine the future of Roe v. Wede, if immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
To ignore what is happening around you is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And, however, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself following a panel of experts discussing the use by Bob Woodward of "with a deep background" source for his book "Fear," the bomber jacket with the skin of the taste ("glorious clothing", said The Washington Post) of Paul Manafort with a value of $15,000 and the implications of Mr Trump's anatomy discs by Storm Daniel.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"Part of what he's doing as if it's realistic show is that every night he's leading you something," said Brent Montgomery, Chief Executive of Weehouse Environmentally and the creator of "Pawan Stars", on the changing cast and the development in the daily batch of the Trump programme (Warning against N.F.L., commending Kim Jong-un).
You cannot afford to lose one episode because you do fall back.
When I contacted Mr Fleiss this week, outside the weather he was at 80 degrees sun on the North coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
It could not come from front of the television, not when Bert Kavanagh was ready to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
"I remember when we used to do those extensive programmes and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of the Western civilisation," Mr Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but in truth they were right."

Large amounts of money arriving from abroad for the most stringent racing in the mid-term election of the White House
It is not surprising that the 17 congregations of Pennsylvania are seeing a large amount of money, thanks to the realignment of congional districts which acquired two operators in a race for the same seat.
This was recently re-established by the peats of the Pittsburg suburban district, the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is emerging as a candidate against another operator, Republican Keith Rothfus, which currently represents the twelve old Pennsylvania districts, which greatly extends over the 17 new districts.
The maps were re-established after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were super-constitutionally loaded in favour of the Republics.
The race in the 17 new districts provided a difficult competition for the financial campaign between the main party's weapons of finance, the Democratic Campaign Communications Committee (DCCC) (DDRC Committee) and the National Republican Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after winning with little difference in the special March election followed by much for the 18th Congregation District of Pennsylvania.
That chair was of a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political criticisms have given the Democracies a small advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, then decided not to do so
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little help from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump held a colloquium with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and held a hotel in Panama until some partners expelled the management team of the Trump Organisation.
The officials of the Department of State decided to re-establish the United States heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the "recent decisions to stop recognising Taiwan", said the speakers of the Department of Heather Nature, in a statement at the beginning of this month.
However, the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which in 2017 received around $140 million in US aid, including narcotic controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be burdensome for the Central American country and its high unemployment and killing rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, officials of North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior management officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with a view to effectively ending any penalty considerations for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence was strongly criticised to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration places on the meeting, said the diplomas.
And the three U.S. messengers returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new and hard message or punishment from Washington.
Speaker of the White House, Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were supported by a foreign analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke of the condition of anonymity.
History Study
The next unexpected negative event could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Müller on the possible disruption of justice by Mr Trump, on which there is now very substantial evidence in the public register.
Mr Mueller is also reported to be turning his investigation into whether Mr Trump’s campaign was agreed with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In the event that the Congress passes on to another person, Mr Trump will find himself responsible in that body, as he prepares himself to go back to the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
This involves many uncertainties, and I do not intend to suggest that the fall of Mr Trump is inevitable – nor that of its equivalent in Europe.
There are options to be made on both sides of the Atlantic which will affect the extent to which the fight is prolonged.
In 1938, German officials were willing to carry out a co-op d'éta against Hitler, which the West would have stood up for and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We did not succeed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history turns to such points of inflation, and the indescribable path of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Today Americans face many of these points of inflation.
What will we do if Mr Trump elected the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rossenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr Mueller's investigation?
Rosenetine has been in trouble since this document reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be recorded in secret and a suspicion that he is not suitable for the post.
Mr Rosenstein said that the The Times report is inaccurate.
"How do I respond if the F.B.I. new request by Bert Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair - or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual behaviour and dishonest evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of the terms for Congress that will keep Mr. Trump responsible?
If we do not pass these tests, it will last for a transition to democracy.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that he had once occupied the house of my ambassadors.
She was able to live, migrate to America and, 60 years later, on the day of worship of God gave me to spread candles on that table in grammar.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Durrans of the Rangers is an optimist before the competitive game with Rapid Vienna
Ringers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against Austrians, following the impressive equal outcome they brought in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League G Group.
A knee injury prevented the midwielder Graham Durrans from making its first appearance of the season to the equal result of 2-2 with Villarreal but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a catalyst for big things.
"This was a good point for us since Villerreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old juvies.
"We got to the game with the belief that we could get something and we went out with a point.
It is likely that we have finally won it but, in all things, an equal result was probably a fair result.
Probably they were better in the first half of the game while we went better in the second half.
Thursday will be a great European evening again.
We hope that we can get three points but this will be difficult because they have had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I am sure that we can continue to do our job and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, between everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but despite this there is a sense of optimism.
The team is good and boys are very happy; the training is good.
I hope we can do our best now, forget the last season and succeed."
Women are concerned about this fear related to retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wished to be cared for, few people were talking to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Ninwede study said that they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to be a member of the family who's in touch with them, but they're not taking steps to have a conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Life Insurance business.
You should start this way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes well before time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how to receive treatment, as those options can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Get your financial adviser: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your long-term care funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid money life insurance policy to help cover these costs or make self-insurance with your own good - provided you have money.
Take a decision after discussing your legal documents in the long term: Avoid legal battles.
Find healthcare to select a reliable individual to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
In addition, consider procurement for your finances.
Choose a person who trusts to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you are ineligible.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"Not only are the finances involved, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
See that that plan is ready."
A man has been hit several times by air shorts in IIfracombe
A man was hit several times by a pilot of airbags as he walked to his house after a night out.
The victim, who has been in his 40th year, was in the Oxford Grove area of IIfracombe, Devon, when he was hit by teri in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called for evidence.
Terremotti and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by earthquakes and severe tsunamis that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, said officials, with the number of deaths expected to increase.
With damage to the lines of communication, the aid officers could not obtain any information from the return of Donggala, which is an area in the north of Palu that is closer to the centre of the earthquake with a strength of 7.5.
In Pale, more than 16,000 people were evicted after the disaster.
These are some of the main facts about Palu and Dongala, about the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawesi, located at the edge of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit the city, it was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Longgala is a resource that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of the coastal north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The return, an administrative region under a province, had a population of around 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the economy of the Central Province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mine is also important in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morial, on the other side coast of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s Disaster Migration Agency, Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, Tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, Tsunami also attacked the western side of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Ring of the Pacific Sismic Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a large earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province of Indonesia on the top of Sumattra stunami struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died in Nis Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Terremot with a force of 6.8 hit south of Java, which is Indonesia's most populated island, which triggered tsunamis that hit the southern coast hard, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Terremot with a force of 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumattra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: Terremot with a power of 7.5 hit one of the islands of Mentawai, beyond Sumattra, which opened tsunamis at a height of 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low earthquake affected Pidie Jaya's return to Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered in the destruction of the earthquake and the fatal tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunamis were fired, but more than 100 were killed because of damaged buildings.
2018: Large Terremoti hit the Lombok island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the top of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of temporarily isolated tourists.
The Grand Child of Sarah Palin Arrestat on Domestic Violence Claims
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and the vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of attack.
Palin, aged 29, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, which interfered with a report of domestic violence and who resisted the arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when female sensitivists tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her hand.
Palin is being held in Ma-Su Pritual Facility and is being held on an unsafe bond of $500, reported by the KTU.
He appeared to the court on Saturday, declaring himself "certainly, not guilty" when he was asked to give his reason, reported the network.
Palin is facing three Class A offences, i.e. he may be imprisoned for up to one year and have to pay a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of a Class B crime, which is punishable by a prison day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been made against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veterans Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of a domestic attack, who interfered with the report of a domestic violence crime, and who held a weapon in his possession while he was a tourist in connection with the incident.
His girl alleged that she had been hit by a rudder in her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by the veterinary groups after a comparison was made between the child's violent behaviour and the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Terremot and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with a power of 7.5 started tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication networks do not work with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just a few out of the centre of Sulawesi located to the north-west of Indonesia's capital, Jakar.
Videos showing the moment of impact are circulating on the media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore with great power.
Federal prosecutors demand that suspected NYC terrorist attack be given a rare death penalty
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding that Sayfullo Saipov who is suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people who were sentenced to death - a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, allegedly used a home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a road for bicycles along the West Side Highway in Lord Manhattan, by flying in October to the passengers and cyclists who were en route.
In order to justify a death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to a notice of intent to claim the death penalty, presented in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, these two heads of the charge bear with them a possible death penalty.
On Fridays following the attack, a federal jury gave Saipov 22 heads of the charge, including eight charges of murder with the aid of organised reconstruction, typically used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
When describing the manner in which Saipov carried out this attack "famous, cruel and immoral", the prosecutors said that the attack required "substantial pre-planning and meditation."
The notice of an intention states that "Sayfullo Habibullavic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clives, Ann-Lauure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Renan Ferruchi, Renan Diego Mendoza, and Alejanro Dumian Pannucco".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York, which launched a death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Etel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after having been convicted of conspiracy to carry out a massacre for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed by the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of rebels in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after he saw ISIS videos on his cell, according to the chief of the charge.
He also asked to put a flag of ISIS in his hospital room, said the police.
He answered unaccusedly to 22 Chiefs of the charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were “certainly disappointed” by the prosecution decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilt warrant for his prison life with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defence team previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
MP Torry says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the conference of Tory, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army of the people".
The former head of the Ukip said that the politicians had "feeling under pressure" from Euroscesses - as suggested by one of Theresa May's own MPs that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
The member of the government of the Conservative Party Peter Bone told the demonstration in Birmingham that until now the United Kingdom would have "come out" if Mr Farage were Secretary of the Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Ms May to reconcile her highly divided positions was highlighted by Tories, who was not in favour of the Brexit that joined a separate protest against the Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to keep her Cequaers' compromise plan on the right path among attacks by the Brexitiers, those against the Brexit and the EU.
Alleleties insisted that despite the negative reaction it will continue to move forward to try to reach an agreement with Brussels - and force Eurostics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and the Caos.
Mr. Bone said to the rally Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "remain the plan of Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been given a high social position and that he should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, so far we would have left," he said.
The MP Wellingbough added: "I will depend on the Brexit but we need to put aside the Chequers' plan."
When he declared it against the EU, he said: "We have not fought a world war to serve me.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and must remain indisputable."
Andrea Jenkyns, a Brexitier of Tory, was also present for the demonstration, where she told journalists: "I want to just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Czechs' plan is not popular with the general public, the Opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and with our activists who are in truth the ones who go on the streets and who first vote for us.
Please forget the Chequers plan and start hearing."
In a message aimed at Ms May, she said: "The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the caller that politicians should "feel under pressure" that they would be going back from the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us -- people -- and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to go back from the Brexit and we are here today to tell them that "we won't let you smooth if you do this."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he said: "I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is at the point of going back from the Brexit.
We are mobilising in the Brexit the army of the people of this country that has brought us success and we will not spend until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the anti-Brexit leaders walked in Birmingham before making a two-hour ring in the centre of the city.
Following the launch of this weekend group, a small number of activists visited canners in writing Tories Aginst Brexit (Tories Against Brexit).
Lord Adonis, who has a high social position in the Labour Party, went to the protest to the Conservatives for security issues that they had suffered with a side of the party as soon as the conference was opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all the IT systems in place and technology for Canada and more, for the unfrozen border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a whole farm.
The idea of good Brexit doesn't exist," he added.
Warren intends to "examine carefully" the possibility to issue for the presidential election
The United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections "we have examined carefully the possibility to issue for the presidential election".
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the member of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about its future in a debate with citizens at municipal level in the West of Massachusetts.
Warren, who is frequently critical of President Donald Trump, will be re-elected in November against the State Representative GOP Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the centre of speculation that might replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with constituents who have been using the format of a debate with citizens at municipal level since Trump took office.
A person attending the meeting asked her if she intended to leave for the presidential election.
Warren replied that it was time to "that women go to Washington to repair our fragmented government, and this includes a woman at the top."
Arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU Sims
Saturday, the police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect was arrested in connection with the shelling of the LSU's bomb player Way Sims that occurred on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayon Simpson at 11 a.m. ET News Conference.
Friday they released a video of shooting, asking for help to identify the man who appears in the video.
Sims, a 20-year-old, was murdered on a trip near the campus of the Southern University on Friday morning.
According to 247 sports, police chief Morphy J. Paul told the media "Wayde Sims suffered a wound caused by a shot in his head and eventually died as a result."
Wayde came to defend his partner and was hit by a flight from Simpson.
Simpson was asked questions and admitted that he was on the scene, who had a weapon, and admitted to shoot on Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and kept under custody in the Police Department of Paris Baton Rouge East.
Sims, a young man who was six feet and who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starters last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton approaches to obtain the world title after the orders of his team gave him victory vis-à-vis Sebastian Vetel
Saturday, from the moment that Valteri Butos qualified before Louis Hamilton, it became clear that the orders of the Merces team would have an important part in the race.
From the position on the inside in the first row, Buttis had a good advantage and almost abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vetel to attack his partner.
Vectel was the first one who entered the stop areas and left Hamilton to leave with the others at the last place of the group, something that had to be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in the stop area after another turn and came out immediately after Vetel, but Hamilton continued to walk after a few steps with a wheel which led to the Ferreri driver leaving with difficulty the free inside because of the risk of falling back after a double shift to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the rear row of the grid and was in the seventh place until the end of the first round in closing his years at the age of 21.
He then was in front of most of the race by not changing his tyres with a view to completing quickly and going over Kimi Rakoken to the fourth place.
He eventually entered the stop area in 44 turns but was unable to step up his pace in the eight rounds that he had stayed while Rakoonen entered the fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valteri did his job very well throughout the weekend and was a true gentleman said let me by.
The team did truly extraordinary work to get first and second place," said Hamilton.
That Was Physically Mistaked
President Donald Trump sent a protest to Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday in connection with her persistence that she had not breached the letter from Christine Blasey Ford that she was accusing the designated person of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When speaking in a ring in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the evidence given by Ford before the Senate of the Judicial Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "villarians and disgruntled and not sincere."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see the people who are angry and vicious and not sincere," he said.
"When you look at statements and disclosure of information and then say "no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, have you missed any information?
Remember her answer... opened the document - "e, e, what is it?
No, you don't.
I didn't do anything."
See, wait a minute.
We've discovered... No, we haven't,” he added, while imitating the Senate.
Feinstein sent her a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and this was discovered earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the disclosure was coming from her office.
"I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not open her story," said Feinstein to the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep her confidential and I kept her confidential as she asked."
But it seems that her rejection was not well received by the president, who, during the week's call of Saturday evening commented: "You know what we know, that that was physically really bad.
He may not have looked, but that's the worst physical act you've ever seen."
While he continued his defence of the designated person of the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three people, the president suggested that the Democracies were using allegations for their purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They see the loyalty, the despair, they do not care about those who hurt, those who make the stickers on the wheels to gain power and control," said the president according to reports from Mediaitis.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfatt Giants
Patrick Duyer twice for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for the loss of the weekly Elite League against Belfatt Giants by winning the game against the same opponent 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants have gained an advantage of two early gouls in the game with two attacks by Patrick Duyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the same score for the team that is playing in his country before Duyer got back an advantage for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard obtained the same score for Dundee before two Gouls of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen confirmed their victory.
This was the third victory of the season in Elite League for Adam Keefe players, after which several losses advanced to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfatt on Friday evening.
This was the fourth time this season that these two teams met, with Giants winning the previous three games.
The first goul of Duyer took place in the fourth minute in 3:35 at a step by Kendal McFalll, with David Rutherford giving the step while Beauvillier doubled the advantage four minutes later.
In what was an opening period with much action, Sullivan brought back the team that is playing in his country back at the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquart gave a step to Counnie at 15:16 which brought the same score for both teams.
Dwyer sure that Giants get an advantage until the first puddle of the game when he made his second gowell of the night at the end of the first period.
The team playing in his country once again joined again and again thanks to Bochard they once again reached the other team with a strong will at 27:37.
Counnie and Charles Corcoran joined in helping Nielsen give Dundee a first-time advantage in the game at the end of the second period and ensured the win with the fifth gowell for his team in the middle of the last period.
Giants, who now lose four of their last five games, will play in their country against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An Air Traffic Supervisor Dies To Ensure That Hundreds of People On the Aircraft May Be Averted
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is regarded as a hero after he died to ensure that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people was safely able to land.
More than 800 people died and many were lost after a large earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which started tsunamis.
Strong attacks continued to dominate the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues fled to save, 21-year-old Antonius Gunwan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower that he was snorting at Palu Airport, Mitira Sis Al Jupre Airport.
He remained calm to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which at the time was located in the runway, could safely leave.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought it was breaking.
He died later in the hospital.
The speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirit, said that the likely decision saved hundreds of lives, reported Australian ABC News.
We had a helicopter from Blicpapan in Calimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we left this morning before the helicopter arrived in Paul.
"When we hear about it, we feel a big foot," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is estimated that the number is still increasing because many bodies were still under crushing while many could not be reached," said the speaker of the Sutopo Puro Nugro agency.
The waves that reached up to six meters destroyed Palu where Sunday will become mass din.
Military and commercial aeroplanes bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mine-markets are being stolen everywhere."
Jan Galfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Cross of Indonesia are working hard to help those who are still alive but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
The President of Indonesia Joko Wido came to Paul Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking you all to work night and day so that you can complete every task related to evacuation.
Letts?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now says that a man is lost following an aircraft accident in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that a man is found missing, having previously said that 47 passengers and crew members had safely been evicted from the sinking aircraft.
Air Nugini said in a statement that from Saturday afternoon, she could not give details about where one male passenger was located.
The airline stated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped to save passengers and other crew after the plane hit water when it tried to land at the airport of the Chouk Island.
The officials said that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the incident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The U.S. airline and fleet both said that the Icelandic plane in the lagoon was just away from the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane exceeded the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane entered very low.
"This is a really good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to pass through the water that was high up until the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said that the flight assistants were snoring and shouting, and that he suffered a minor injury in his head.
The U.S. Naval Fleet said that seafarers working closely to improve moll also helped rescue by using an explosive boat to transport passengers to the shore before the plane landed at about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents but no incident has involved Air Niugini.
Analist presents an evening schedule in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded on Saturday its evidence on the case in the new process of a man who is accused of burning a woman from Myssipi in 2014 while she was alive.
The U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlet has witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile records to gather information on the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Telelis defendant and the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19-year-old, on the night of his death.
Roullet said that he received localisation data from several mobile phones that showed that Telelis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the phone data showed that he was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and witnessed that then he wasn't in the city.
When the prosecutors asked if Telelis was telling the truth when he said that that night was in Sanford's truck, Sanford said that he was "behaving, since my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Telelis said that he had known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they knew each other only one week.
Roulette said that some time after the death of Chambers, Telelis deleted Chambers' messages, phone calls and contact information from his cell phone.
"He deleted it from his life," said Hale.
Defence is scheduled to start its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the process to pass to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip?
Three hip hop artists must challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop went beyond its origins of political messages and is addressing social issues.
They want to go back to his roots and again make the popular conscious hip hip.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen recent re-uptakes in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nanny from NY drives a couple to get rid of her after a "razzist" message
Nanny from New York is launching a couple for discriminatory dismissal after he accidentally received a message from the mother who was complaining that she was a "other black person."
The couple deny that they are racists, and compare the case with "exortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two children, expressed regret when she learned that the new child-rearing person, Giselle Maurice, had given a dark interview when he arrived for the first working day in 2016.
"LEEEEEEEEE OTHER SWEDEN PERSON," wrote Ms Plasco-Flexman in a letter to her husband.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent him Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After noting her bad mistake, Plasco-Flexman felt "coated" and dismissed Ms Maurice, saying that her former African-American Nanny did not do well and that instead she was waiting in the Philippines, according to New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for her one working day and then sent home by Uber.
Now, Maurice is pushing the couple to compensation in respect of the dismissal, and is demanding compensation of $350 a day for the six-month live-in position for which she was initially employed, despite having no contract.
I want to show them, listen, can't do such things," said to Post Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple attacked the claims of racists, claiming that Ms. Maurice's expulsion was the most reasonable thing they could do, fearing that they could not trust her after they defended her.
"Martie gave her something that she did not intend to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco to Post.
"But if you trust your children in the hands of someone who spoke to you with the guff, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn?
And let's go."
When comparing the case with "extortion", Plasco said that it had only been two months since his wife had a baby and was found "in a very difficult situation".
"Are you going to accuse someone like this?
It's not something nice to do," added the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly announced to the couple on social media, informing them of their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington’s publishers feared that the readers would not relate to an ors that spoke
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who is reading it for the first time before it was published.
"It is really fun to know what we now know about the great success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman of the BBC before he was inspired to write the book of the children from a small game orchestra, would certainly have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "pleasant but turned a little bit wrong" after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she described as "a member of our family very important," she added that her father was proud of his eventual success although he had never been able to speak about him.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't filled with him," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like when you had a child to get something: be proud of them even if it wasn't you who got something.
I think he was looking at the success of Paddington in that way.
Although he was his creation and imagination, he was always giving the merit to Paddington himself."
Benti was dying and I had to give her the last kiss on the phone.
As soon as her daughter was taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors worked to save her life but was all in vain.
"Nad was regularly calling to tell me that the situation was very bad, which she was not expected to live," said Ms Ednan-Laperuse.
"Then I received a call from Nad to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to give her the last smile.
And so I did.
Tell her, "Tashi, I love you very, dear to me.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were decreasing and leaving her system slow.
She had died a little of the time before and started cutting everything.
All I could do was sit down and wait, aware that all of this is happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold back really."
Eventually, Ms Ednan-Laperuse, who had been crying for the loss of her daughter so far, went on the plane together with the other passengers – who did not know of the difficult situation she was experiencing.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had a low head, and tears began to drop all the time.
It was difficult to explain, but there was on the flight that I felt a great sense of sympathy towards Nad.
That he needed my love and that I should say.
I knew how much he loved her."
Post cards of distressed women to avoid suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost a loved one because of suicide are working to prevent others from getting rid of themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were sticking cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiration messages and telephone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, Mrs Davis's son, was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and killed himself at 18 years of age.
"I don't want no parent to feel what I feel I am daily," she said.
Ms Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew for his smile.
They were always saying that his smile was turning on every room."
However, he had to stop working before he died, because he was found "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Brother Tyler, who at that time was 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had killed himself.
Ms Davis said, "I will always be afraid" that this will cause another terrible event."
Ms Davis created the cards, "to inform people that there are people who can open your heart to them or meet them, even as a friend.
Do not sit in silence - you need to speak."
Ms Humphreys, who has been a friend for years with Ms Daves, has lost her partner Mark for 15 years, not much after his mother's death.
"He didn't say that he was feeling bad or depressed or so," she said.
"In two days before Christmas we noted a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day it was very bad - when the children opened their gifts with no contact with them with his eyes or something like that."
She said that his death was a great tragedy for them, but they want to fight her: "Let me be empty in the family.
It delivers us.
But we all want to continue living and fighting."

The future of Bert Kavanaugh is in a precarious situation as the FBI initiates an investigation.
"I said, if we could get something like what he asked - a time-limited investigation, limited in purpose - maybe we would have brought some unity," said Mr. Falke on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "throwing" amongst party paralyses that grew roots.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the choice of time.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November - if, as expected, the Republicans do not go well, in that case they will be severely weakened in their attempts to place the man they want to be elected in the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was taking the phone to call the Senators, to persuade them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush and who met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of Mr Bush.
What will happen after the FBI presents its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, where they currently occupy a position 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, Vice-President, to vote and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of warehouses in North Korea "falls" under Kim
The number of North Korean depositors for South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, said South Korean legislator.
When quoting data from the Ministry for the unification of the South Lakes, Park Byeong-seug said that last year there were 1,127 changes in the party – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates that human smugglers were demanding were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of the warehouses from the North side are evenly offered South Korean citizenship.
As of the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most of them escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross compared to the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) highly protected between the two parts of Korea.
China considers the deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their country by force.
Relations between North and South Africa – technically still in war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the standstill of denuclearisation negotiations.
This took place after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards the Korean peninsula free of nuclear danger.
But Saturday, North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho joined the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, in no way will we be the first to unilaterally remove weapons," said Mr Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosis calls Bert Kavanaugh "sterical," saying that he is unable to work in the Supreme Court
The minority leaders of the Chamber Nancy Pelosis called the person nominated for the Supreme Court Mr Bert Kavanaugh "sterical" and said that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because of his temporary behaviour.
Pelosis made these comments in a Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't think of the fact that if a woman were ever to behave in that way, they would say "sterical," said Palosi about her reaction to Kavanawagh's testimony before the Judicial Committee of the Thursday Year.
emotionally Kavanagh denied the allegations that he had been sexually abused by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were still young.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even shouting and yelling when he was talking about his family and his secondary school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democracies in the committee, calling the allegations against him "association of the grotteska and coordinated character" organised by the liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosis said that she believed that Kavanaugh's witnesses had proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, because he had demonstrated that he had prejudices against the Democracies.
"I think that he qualifies himself with those declarations and the way in which he went after the Clintons and the Democracies," she said.
Pelosis was disturbed when it was asked whether she tried to accuse Kavanaugh if it was confirmed, and whether the Democracies obtained a majority in the Chamber of Representatives.
"I'm going to say something -- if he's not telling the truth to the Congress or the FBI, so he's not able, not only to be in the Supreme Court, but even to be in the court he is currently in," said Pelosis.
Currently Kavanaugh is a judge at the D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosis added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affortable Care Act or Roe v. Wede, as it is considered conservative justice.
In its confirmatory hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would alter certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not appropriate for a person with stylistic prejudice to go to court and wait to say, "very well," said Pelosis.
And Women Need to Exercise Their Authority.
It is a fair verbal attack, months and years full of anger, and she cannot say what she should say without crying.
"We cry when we fight," I was told by Mr Stephenem 45 years later.
"I don't think this is a rare thing, what does it say?"
She added, "Give me a lot of a woman who was engaged in some other place, who said that even she was crying when she was raised, but developed a technique that meant that when she was growing up and starting to cry, she was telling the person she was talking to, "Perhaps you are thinking about crying because I'm crying.
I am angry."
And then he did not stop.
And I thought that it was something brilliant."
The crying is permitted as a way to partially get out of his great anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, where I once found myself crying with indescribable anger, was when an older woman passed me through the cack of her neck - a cold manager I always feared some of - and carried me to the stairs.
"Never let them cry," I said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are sad and happy that they have been able to hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Democratic Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was going out for the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in a relationship outside of marriage on a boat known as Monkey Business and issued since the election, Ms Schroeder, was very angry, she concluded that there was no reason why she did not explore the idea of issuing herself for the presidential election.
"This was not a well-planned decision," I said with an entry 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who would go out for the election, and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Somebody called it "White Snow and the Seven Nani."
As this was at the end of the campaign, she was back in the collection of funds, and therefore she insisted that she would not go out to the election if he did not make $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who had given $1,000 to her men were only giving her $250.
"They think I take something according to?" she said.
When she made her speech in which she announced that she was not going to launch a formal campaign, she was so emotional - so grateful to the people who supported her, driven by the system that made it so difficult to collect the funds and to target the voters instead of the delegates, and driven to sex - that it was closed.
"I probably thought I had these strong brakes," she recalled Mrs Schroder about the way the media responded to it.
"You thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my grave?
"Is she crying?"
How the US-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The number of air bombs opening the trade war between the US and China was disturbing, and while the battle was still ending, a lack of agreement between countries could benefit long-term Beijing, say experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, gave the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exporters including solar panels, iron and aluminium.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting items amounting to $200 billion (€150 billion), and effectively taxing all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing recalibrated at the same time, while more recently it was presenting charges of five to ten percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to agree with the US every time, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will exceed in the near future.
The fact that Washington takes a step backwards means accepting the requests, but the fact that China exceeds the US will be too embarrassing for Xiping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing works wisely, US trade war pressures can support China positively in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions to start an economic nightmare in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what the viewers previously acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, research partners focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, which is a reflection group.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moalem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate terrorist-affected areas to restore normality.
All the conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees in the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war started in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moalem said that the Syrian regime welcomes help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the edition.
Europe embraces Ryder Cup win in Paris
Taam Europe won the Rider Cup 2018 against Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in a European land and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again won the title when the team of Danish master Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points that needed to win the US.
Phil Mikkelson who is prominent in the United States, who fought during the entire season, gave his draw into the water in the 16th par-3 hole, and thus gave up his game to Francisco Molinari.
The Italian Molinari golf spewed in all his rounds, and became 1 out of 4 players who have ever brought 5-0-0 since the current format of the torture started in 1979.
The American Jordan Siepha lost 5&4 against the player at least level on the European team, the Denmark Thorbjjn Olesen.
The world's highest-level player, Dustin Johnson, brought 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England who played in his final Rider Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best European player of torture ever here with 25.5 points along his career.
"I don't usually cry but today I couldn't hold.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy, very pleased that I got back the cup.
The team is everything, and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia emotional after the European victory.
He sends his fellow partner John Ram who won the United States golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles play Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel, which I have won for Tiger Woods, when I grew up following him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a record of Ryder Cup 13-21-3 throughout his career.
Strange statistics of one of the best players ever here, which won 14 main titles, the second after Jack Niklaus alone.
Team USA strives to find those parts of the golf course with the exception of Patrick Red, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf during the whole season.
The U.S. master Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his team, "I am proud of these men, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we put some pressure on Europe.
Argumentna.
To Thomas we take the hat.
He's a very good master.
His 12 players played very well.
We will join again, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
To these 12 judges I love and I am proud that I am master.
You'll have to catch the hat and lay your head down.
Play better than her."
