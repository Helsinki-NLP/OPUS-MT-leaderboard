Listen to me carefully.
There's something about him we have to talk about.
I don't like seeing animal abuse.
Tom left the cement house before Mary's funeral.
One of the greatest anxieties of life is how a cat decides what its next step is.
I ate the beetle we cooked a few days ago.
I've got a lot to do today.
Tom jumped into the frozen water.
Are you sure there's no way?
Tom said he couldn't walk.
I'll wait down.
Of course she's sick.
The boat's changed.
Maybe we should go see Tom.
Now bring trouble.
Nobody was up yet.
I'll remember you forever.
Tom was shocked.
I'll do your advice.
Tom bet on the wrong horse.
Please explain the rejection.
Thank you for paying attention.
We've been waiting for you for hours until you show up.
Tom wasn't the only one who got up so early this morning.
The road's too narrow for a truck pass.
We're in trouble.
How many students do you have in school?
It feels like it's the right thing to do.
Tom knows Mary's hiding something.
They all deserve to die.
I barely knew him.
Many animals that have lived for thousands of years no longer exist.
Let's not.
Did you guys have a nice weekend?
Am I stupid?
She was depressed about all her problems.
Do you eat meals at a price?
Because the rain stopped. He went on a trip.
The doctor knew how to deal with such an emergency.
The temperature dropped by 10 degrees.
I know this neighborhood.
She's filed a request for Eisa.
I thought everything was over.
It's dangerous to swim at night.
It's just like fighting wind safety.
I don't care about the risk.
It's weather forecast time.
It looks tough.
That man's dangerous.
She cooked us a great meal.
He was a soldier during the war.
I'm on the beach.
That was my first thought.
We don't blame you.
We can't live without sleep as we can't live without food.
Someone just rang.
They knew better days.
He's alive out of his hand.
If you don't hurry, you'll never get to the village.
We think the reason for his success was hard work.
I got tired of it.
It's all up to your decision.
You're thin.
He's in a state of mind, his hand supports his forehead.
There's not much to say.
Look, here he comes.
She was really cold.
It's on my assignment list.
Be careful not to fall to scratch the knee.
I gave it to my mom.
Stop wasting time.
I felt pretty bad.
My hobby is a reading.
I'll have my coffee after dinner.
I don't forgive you.
They don't believe you.
That wasn't supposed to happen.
I don't want to learn tonight.
Tom thinks Mary's making a gross mistake.
I always knew Tom was meant to grow.
It rained quietly.
Can you send this letter in a quick mail?
Close it.
Tom's not in charge.
Hey, guys, I'm Tom, and I'm here with Mary.
You guys look beautiful tonight.
We experienced one problem with the brand yesterday.
Tom visited Mary on October 20.
When I got home, I found your letter waiting for me.
They're Russians.
It's simpler than it looks.
She seems to me a real and trustworthy person.
Tom athletic.
He tried.
We can't survive without your help.
I was the one who suggested it.
This affair isn't as good as his last affair.
They stayed that way for a while.
This path is dangerous.
Can you show me the way to the library?
I stayed at home all day and read books.
That's my decision.
It's okay.
I made him go.
Get him to come watch a movie.
Tom was broken.
Don't you know what I'm saying?
I know exactly how you feel.
I met Tom in January.
They made a joint decision about divorce.
Stop bothering me.
Today, I'm in a mood for me.
It doesn't happen much.
We're planning on visiting Mr. Smith tomorrow.
He's got a comfortable nature.
I don't want to leave this place ever.
My son is my greatest headache.
Please sit down!
I can't drive the car.
She invited each of us to ice cream.
She played the play.
Tom told me he didn't see Mary all day.
I don't like being alone on the beach.
I never plan anything.
You got a map?
Tom was sweating.
Do I have to sell this?
They're calling by handmarks.
Maybe we should ask someone for help.
I'm hungry.
That's hard to read.
I've been snooping for a week and I haven't recovered yet.
We started walking again right after she recovered.
Is there an English-Japan dictionary on the shelf?
The gun's up.
We're too few now.
We have to stay alert.
What's the matter with Tom at all?
They had a child.
Tom seems troubled.
Maybe Tom's telling the truth.
Civilization is now a threat of nuclear war.
I often have nightmares.
The company has decided to hire two new secretary.
Please give me a pillow.
Tom almost killed both of them.
I wanted to watch this movie with you.
Come at least six.
I'm getting out of your clue.
The taxi is very intuitive.
I'll get it back right away.
Tom and Mary are miserable, too.
What group does your friend include?
Just Tom, we'll stay.
Please sit still.
Tom decided to stay behind.
Shut up, please.
Do you like what you see?
Give me a second chance.
It's natural.
Don't ever write the words "Merque Lap" and "Marco kerb" in German!
This is a violent neighborhood.
You'll be surprised what you can learn in a week.
There are animals that can feel a storm.
How can I ever forgive Tom?
This house looks abandoned.
This is the perfect place for the ambush.
Consult the doctor.
I'm jealous.
These are my friends.
She's in love with this kid.
Tom didn't finish all his homework.
How do you know about Tom?
You sound childish.
I know you'd do the same to me.
By the end of the day, they're getting their color up and they're getting married.
Tom never admits by mistake, because he thinks it's a sign of weakness.
That's how I like it.
She admitted she didn't meet Maria.
It's the second river in its length in Japan.
No one's happy.
I finally don't owe anyone.
Tom spoke rudely.
He's married and father to two.
Could have been a failure in the answer.
He's squeezing his bike every week.
Don't turn the computer off.
That distance can't be noticed anymore.
She received guidance from her old doctor and was transferred to another hospital.
I was broke.
My best friend speaks Irish.
It's more complicated than I thought at first.
I don't know anything about him.
I only had a few beers.
The man who's blowing the car is Mr. Jones.
I have to make it to my friend.
I stayed calm.
She likes to try new things.
I heard him clean up.
Go to the next page.
Did you become an angel?
I hope this can happen now.
Materials will be removed.
Did I touch a exposed nerve?
There are many vacation places in big cities.
The first blow is half the fight.
Even though I'm not sure.
I've really seen a ghost.
Did you recover from the shock?
Tell Tom I'm going for a ride.
It's all over the head.
Do you happen to know where she lives?
Tom and Mary are probably going to get married one day.
Their house was set on fire.
I like this picture.
Grab a nap.
Eventually, his dream came true.
I've worked very hard.
Not to be dead.
She didn't have to answer the question.
Rich oranges in vitamin C.
I'm sure Tom told you I'd be here.
This system has no advantages and no advantages.
He hid the fact that he expelled his wife.
Shut your big mouth.
Tom told Mary about his new car.
Who invented the dynamite?
You're the greatest love of my life.
A fruitful attempt.
Where's your money?
Tom asked Mary to sing harder.
Sorry, I can't stay long.
I don't know if it's a top.
Where's the toothbrush?
Let's get something cold to drink.
It's Sprouts.
I want a guitar like John's.
It won't bother us if you take a picture from the outside.
The purpose is to sanctify the means.
You seem to have a lot of knowledge of it.
Do you support or resist humiliation?
Please don't interfere with this.
Long Time No C.
Today I won't get an e-mail from anybody.
I was waiting for you.
The cat ran off his back.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Tom is from Boston.
You want to know how I did this?
I can't find the paper.
I'm learning one language.
This microscope increases itself by a hundred.
He's in debt.
Tom's an entourage.
Tom's not the one who left the party early.
Speaking English in Canada?
That's really impressive!
We wanted dessert.
Tom didn't get up early enough.
Hello, how can I help you?
Tom pointed his gun to the target.
I believe my friend's growing my horns.
You'd better leave.
Donald Trump suffers from dementia.
Don't ask, please.
I'm coming to kill you.
I like the time between the Syrians.
You should go.
You ready to go?
I know how that must sound.
Can anyone help me out here?
Where'd Tom get the prisoner's house?
I've learned the best.
Don't rush to protect me.
I only know that.
Don't ignore me again.
Field of construction: we have to use protective helmets.
It's Tom's locker.
I'm sure I won't recommend Tom for the job.
You should try not to forget the time.
Will you go to the U.S. next year?
Think of your future.
As far as I'm concerned, I don't trust him at all.
I don't know what to say.
It rained yesterday.
She was caught with her pants down.
I know maybe you think I'm too young.
I can't help him.
It didn't go that much.
How does everybody feel?
We're supposed to be safe here.
Have you had breakfast today?
There's a bridge three miles up the river.
Tom offered Mary not to do that.
I know you think there's no hope.
The judges have made a decision.
Hard to learn Greek?
He's going to the library to read books.
They're animals in this town.
The sky will be clear soon.
I didn't like Tom.
We're trying to learn here.
Please, adopt this dog pup.
It's impossible to provide it.
Go back to your chair.
She chose a hat for her new dress.
I spent the last Sunday at home.
Let's not do anything that might upset Tom.
I'm short of money.
I'll finish reading this novel soon.
Tom doesn't seem interested in what's going on.
I don't want you to see my daughter anymore.
You guys don't go out there.
Tom drinks about three gallons of water a day.
We'll never agree.
We were glad we were alive.
Some newspapers distorted the news.
Sign it, please.
That's my car.
I'd love to see that.
That pen is the best.
The adulation of heroes is a dangerous matter.
Tom says he doesn't want to get involved in this anymore.
The paper's white.
Drinks are half price to six.
The sky is clear almost every day.
Well, I lied.
Whatever you do, don't come up with demands to sign it.
Paris is a very schism for Japanese teenagers.
This bridge is three times longer than he is.
I tried not to eat too much.
Tom looks desperate.
They slept in the same bed.
His success depends on his efforts.
I've got quite a lot of hats.
The settlers built their homes along the river.
It was impossible to remove the traffic.
Today was exciting.
I'm standing by.
Just the necessary repairs, please.
Salt, please.
Have you decided where to eat lunch?
I changed my theory.
She was kind enough to pick me up from the house.
I ran.
Tom's the account manager.
Raise your left hand.
I doubt the validity of his statement.
I think they're having some kind of trouble.
This movie is boring.
Where to go and what to see were my main concerns.
My longest romantic connection lasted four months.
She never told me yet.
To an old velvet hat he always wears in the rain.
