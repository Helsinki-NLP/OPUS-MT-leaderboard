Members of Parliament in Wales are afraid to look like dolls.
Some members of the Parliament were alarmed by the proposal that their title would be changed from the AMs to the MWPs.
This fear arose following plans to change the name of the house of laws to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Parliament in all the political arena are concerned that the thing will order a cake.
One member of Parliament from the Leaburg Party said that his people were afraid that "it's gonna go out with Twp and Pwp."
For a name outside Wales: in the Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means poop.
A member of the Parliament of the Flemish Party said that all his friends were “unwelcome” and offered alternatives.
A member of the Walish Party said that his friends were "open to offers" about changing the name, but he said that the name MWP (the head of the Volsey Parliamentman) sounded very similar to the word Muppet (a doll doll).
In this context, the Volshite signal is similar to the word of the letter and the English word "Yocchier" in the יהוה.
The House of Legislatives, which is currently introducing the legislation to change the names, said: "The final decision on every word describing the names of the members of the legislature is of course the decision of the members of the legislature themselves."
The Wills Government Act of 2017 gave the Volksi legislature the authority to change his name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals, which provided broad support to change the name of the House of Legislatives to the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the office of the members of the Parliament (AMs), the Commission recommended that the members of the House of Parliament or the heads of WMPs, but the MWP option received most support in the consultation with the public.
Members of the Parliament offer alternative options, but the struggle to get a Concensus can cause quite a bit of pain to the Chairman of the Commission, Ellen Jones, who is supposed to submit a draft of legislation on the changes in the weeks ahead.
The legislation on reforming other changes in the workings of the legislature, including rules for the removal of members of Parliament and the structure of the committee system.
The vote of the members of the Parliament is that it will eventually determine their title of role in the debate of legislation.
The citizens of Macedonia are going to the cards in the question with a change in the country's name.
The citizens will vote on Sunday on the question whether to change their name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The nation’s wish was to try to resolve a ten - year dispute with neighbor Greek, where there is a province called Macedonia.
Greece argued a long time ago that there was a struggle in the area of Greece and that it opposed Macedonia's attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, who opposed the people's question about changing the name, said he would ignore his results.
However, whoever supports the people's question, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, claims that a change of name is just the price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's church bells are still the worst of the churches in Harlem.
According to Mr. Adams, "old neighborhoods were already a bar and a church in every corner."
"There are no bars, no churches."
According to him, you can understand the disappearance of bars.
People's company lives are running differently today, says.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhood living room where people visit on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last for as long as the church heads expect, “and sooner or later, they will find themselves again at the beginning.”
According to the church's headquarters, apartment buildings with common homes will be built by people who are not the kind of people who will help the neighborhood to maintain a unique character.
“The majority of the people who purchase these apartments will be white people, ” he says, “and so will the closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that most people who have moved to these apartments will join these churches.”
Two churches were built by a community that believed in building, before Harlem became the majority of its residents in the Black Sea — the Communist Metropolitan Church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The white Buddhist community left in the 30s of the previous century.
A community of black believers in the area became the owner of the building.
The Church of St. Martin moved to a black-believed community under priest John Howard Johnson, who led a raid on traders on 125th Street, a central shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the structure, but as part of the plans of the believers under Reverend Johnson to rebuild it, they invited the construction of the bells' trailer.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson the Father and who took his place at the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the title "Palls of the Poor".
The expert who played the July Creole named him another "cultural treasure" and "history tool that doesn't have a substitute."
The expert, Tiffany Ing of Michigan University, also mentioned that this is the world's first bell career to be played by a black musician, Dionysio I. Lind, who continued to play the greatest crown at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Mariot'r said that St. Martin's church didn't suit him.
What happened at St. Martin's church over the last few months was a complex story of architects and contractors, some of which were brought by local church leaders, and others by the episcopic churches.
The meeting — which is the governing body of the congregation of believers made up of local believers — wrote to the publishers in July a letter explaining the concern that the publishers had “tried to turn the costs into the meeting, ” although the meeting was not involved in the collection of architects and contractors sent out by the churches.
Some of the believers complained about the lack of faith on the part of the church.
13-year-old wound shark in the sound to catch lobsters
A 13-year-old shark attacked and wounded a boy on Saturday while the boy was snoring to catch lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, thus giving official causes.
The attack occurred shortly before 7:00 a.m. near the shore of the Beacon in Ascinitas.
Chad Hamel told the KSWB-TV network in San Diego that he was hanging out with friends of this one at an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy scream for help and then ran into a group to help pull him to the beach.
Hamel first thought a question was just the cymbals of enthusiasm for Lobster's catch, but then he realized that the boy was yelling, "I bit!
I'm bitten!"
Hamel said that when he approached the boy, he saw that his "every bone of his escape" was paralysed.
"I yelled at everyone out, "There's a shark in the water!"
The boy was taken to Rady Hospital in San Diego where he was defined as a human being.
I don't know what kind of shark attacked the boy.
The rescue commander for Ari Giles said in a press briefing that a shark was identified in a few weeks earlier, but it was determined not to be a dangerous food shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Authorities have closed off access to the coast between Ponto Bezad Beach and Suwami Coast, Asynitas, for 48 hours for investigative and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the UK beauty product market.
Sainsbury's starting a competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and opening dog store-style passage with women who sell.
As part of a significant initiative to enter the UK's beautiful product market, which is filled with 2.8 billion Sterling per year, and as sales continue to grow in the fashion and furniture sectors of the home in Beida, the larger collections of beauty products will be checked at 11 stores across the country and if the experiment is successful, they will be added to additional shops next year.
The investment in beauty products comes at a time when you can pick up ways to use a mapped field previously captured by televisions, microwaves and homemades.
The Sainsbury's said that the company is expected to double its performance of up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, for the first time in its history.
Existing product lines of L'Orial, Maybelline and Burt's Bees companies will also win another area with certain brand areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The mercery network also resuscitates its makeup product line - Botique - so most products will be friendly to vegans, a feature that has been searched for by young buyers.
Also, the FRAGrance Shop network will check for privileges at the two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which was opened in Crowidan, south of London, last week and the second of which will be opened in Sly Ok, Bramingham, at a later date this year.
Buying online and passing on to buy too little food every day in local comfortable shops obliges consumers to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Cave, the director of Sainsbury's, said that the branches would become more dolls for dogs while the warehouse network was trying to fight against the cheap Aldi and Lidl networks with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbory's added points of sale to Argos in hundreds of stores as well as number of habitat points since she bought both networks two years ago, plus that her words brought up the sales of the product and made the purchases more profitable.
Past attempts by the network to revive the parts of beauty products and her pharmacies ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the communication ended after a disagreement over how to divide the profits from the clinic's houses into the melons.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbory's sold the pharmaceutical business in 281 synapsies to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical network for 125 million Sterling three years ago.
Loyds, according to her, played a role in the program, by extending the brands of brands of expensive leather-growing products, including La Roche-Posy and Vichy, in four shops.
Sainsbury's commercial manager, Paul Mills-Hicks, said: "We've done a reverse in the looks and feelings of our beauty products, to improve the environment for customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained workers who will be able to consult in a location.
The performance of our brands is designed to fit all the needs and the environment and our comfortable environments make us an interactive target for the acquisition of beauty products, in a way that challenges the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is upset after Holly Willaby canceled an 11 million Starling deal.
The TV program star Dragons Den, Peter Jones, expressed rage after TV show Holly Willaby canceled an 11 million Sterling deal with his lifestyle brands to focus on her new strings with Mark And Spencer and ITV.
Actually, Willaby doesn't have time for a brand of their home clothes and accessories.
The two's common business is like the Goop score of actress Gwynth Paltro.
37-year-old This Morring served to announce her departure in Post in Eastgram.
Holly Willaby left the planet Dragons Den Peter's out of anger by recently canceling her participation in the two precious lifestyle brand -- to focus on her oil reserves with Mark And Spencer and ITV.
Sources have said that 'Nance responded with rage' when the TV star announced during a thrice meeting at the main offices of his business empire in Marlo, Bakinghe, who followed her new deals -- up to 1.5 starling -- she didn't have enough time to pay for their own Truly clothes and accessories.
The two's joint business was like the Goop score of actress Gwynth Paltro and was expected to double the value of Willaby, which was estimated to be 11 million Sterling.
While 37-year-old Willaby published her leaving Truly, Jones was on a British flight to one of his resort homes.
According to one source, "Truly was clearly at the top of Holly's priority order.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would provide her with income for the next decade.
The decision to leave all involved was totally surprising.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
Marlowe's stores are full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that leaving This Morning's access, which is one of Britain's most profitable stars, may rise to the company millions as a result of massive investments in various products, from mines and candles to household clothes, and from the potential for further delays in the launch.
And it may bring to an end a long friendship.
Willaby, who is a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, ten years ago.
Willaby set up Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the president of the Society in March.
The couple spent vacations together and Jones owns 40% of the Baldwin TV production company.
Willavi becomes the ambassador of the M&S brand and replaces Annette McPerlin as an introduction to I'm A Celibry's ITV program.
A close source to Jones said last night: "We're not responding to his business affairs."

He joked about her criticism he won from the new press about statements that are defined as "non-Presidentship" and that he is so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said with the voice of "Newsport".
"I didn't do any turn."
He noted that Kim was interested at a second meeting after he celebrated their first meeting in June as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear-weapon-extinguishing.
But negotiations on the deployment of a frozen nuclear weapon.
More than three months after the June summit meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Riy Young Ho, reported on Saturday to the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a response from the U.S. to the first weapon launch steps that it had undertaken in North Korea.
Instead, according to him, the United States continues with sanctions designed to continue the pressure.
Trump took on a much more optimistic point of view in his arrest.
"We're in excellent shape with North Korea," he said.
"We almost went to war against North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim brought positive results -- the cessation of missile experiments, assistance with the release of prisoners and the return of the remains of American soldiers to their homes.
And he protected his extraordinary attitude in talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this whole stadium, we had about 200 people standing there," said Trump when he was voting right in front of him.
Tsunami and the Land Convention in Indonesia have ruined an island and killed hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Lombob, for example, non-State foreign organizations were told that they did not need their help.
Although more than 10% of the Lomboc population lost their homes, no national disaster was declared, which would be subject to international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it's a little challenging," said Mrs. Sobong.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to drive to Pallo, it is not clear if foreign delegates can travel in the field.
Mr. Sotopo, the NSA spokesman, said that Indonesian authorities were engaged in assessing the situation in Palo to see if any more international services contributed to the relief effort.
In view of the unprovoked earthquake in Indonesia, the country remains unstintingly ill prepared for natural disasters.
While tsunamis were built in the province of Acea, they are rare in other coastal areas.
The obvious lack of alarm alarms on the Phalo tsunami, although there is a warning, is likely to result in loss of life.
Even in the best times, the journey between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complex.
A hospital ship that played in Lombob to deal with earthquake victims makes its way to Pallo, but it'll take her at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
The improvement of Indonesia's famine infrastructure was at the President Wuko and Vidido's campaign center, and he invested a lot of money in roads and railways.
But Mr. Juko stood in front of a fund to be re-elected next year.
Mr. Guko also faced pressure from continuing class examinations in Indonesia as a result of the religious fervor of the majority of Muslims in the country.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes in battles between Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets - using knives, orders, and other household weapons.
The video: Daniel Stridge from the Liberple Group is just equal to the last minute in front of Clesy.
Daniel Sturgel saved Lyberpol from the loss of Lessey in Fremier League with a 89-minute gate on Saturday at St. Bridge in London.
Stridge got a pass from an office in Shakari when he was about 30 feet from the gate of Clesy and his group at 1-0.
He jumped the ball to his left and then turned a kick towards the distant cobra.
The ball flew over the surface and landed towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball ended up landing over the cave of Kappa Arabelga that he was snoring at, and fell into the net.
I was just trying to get to this position, get to the ball and play like Shack always playing ahead as far as possible, so I was just trying to make myself as much time as possible, told Sjrog to the LeverpoolFC website.com.
"I saw Kanta and I made one touch and I didn't think about it too much and I just kicked."
Clesy led 0-1 in half after the Belgian planet's Red-Zarin' was wearing a gate on the 25th minute.
The blue pioneer moved a drop back to Mato Kobatch in the same game, before he turned close to the middle of the field and ran fast into half of the liberal court.
Kobach's made a quick and quick maneuver in the middle of the field.
And then he kicked a pretty good-looking kick that led the stranger into the space.
The old stranger ran the defense and ended with the ball inside the upper right corner of the gate, with a left kick that passed the liberal Alison cattle player.
Lybul will face Napole on Wednesday at 3:00 at the San Pulu Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Clesy will face a video in the European League of U.S.A. on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The victims of the earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia flew to 832, thus informing the State Disaster Agency on Sunday morning.
It was reported that many people caught up in the destruction of the buildings that collapsed in the 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and caused a wave of up to six feet [6 m] high, said the agency's spokesman Sotopo Foro was shot at a press conference.
The city of Palo, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was drunk in the destruction of damaged buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The police opened an investigation into a murder after a woman's body was found in Biancad this morning, Marcid.
The 44-year-old woman is at 7.55 a.m. on June Street with a stabbing body, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police call people from the area who saw or heard something to turn to.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at the beginning, but I would like to break anyone who was near Jun Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious, to turn to us.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially cab drivers, who may have taken something in a car camera, to turn to us because the photographs may include information that is vital to our investigation."
A police officer confirmed that the woman who had died was living in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a building.
The scene came this afternoon to friends who believed that they knew the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigations continue while the police have announced that they are now in the process of sending messages to relatives.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mewes just tried to get in his apartment, but he was told that the police were expecting anyone to enter the building or get out of it.
He was shocked to find out what happened.
The residents are now told that they'll have more hours to go back to their apartments.
A cop sounds like telling one person that the whole area is now a crime scene.
A woman looked at the scene when she's whining.
She's going back and she's muttering. It's terrible.
At 2:00, we'll expect two police trucks inside the scene and another one from outside her.
A number of cops stood inside the scene when they were targeting people in the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message on Twitter to @MerPollCC, to dial 101, or to contact Crimestopopers on the phone of 111,555,800 and to mention Journal number 247 dated 30 September.
The statue of the Parliament of Cromwell became the next target for attacks on memory conditions in the struggle around the historical record.
The statue locking will be poetic justice in view of the Italian lockdown that his Protestant supporters have made so many cultural and religious art objects in England.
But in the Cromwell Society, Mr. Creek's suggestion is "foolish" and "demonstrated to write history."
"Jon Goldsmith," said the chairman of the Cromwell Society, "I was not prevented by the current controversy over the removal of statues, the character of Oliver Cromwell, who is outside Westminster's palace, would become a target.
The decomposition of the statues of the civil wars in England was not carried out under the command of Cromwell and was not carried out by him.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell fell victim to the actions of one of his predecessors, Thomas Cromwell, in the century before.
The impressive representation of Cromwell at the hands of the statue, Sir William Hammo Ternicroft, is a testimony to an observation in the 19th century and some of the history of a character that many believe should still be respected.
Mr. Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: "The Cromowell was captured by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as protecting Parliament against outside pressure, in his case, of course, the Kingdom.
The question if that's a completely accurate assessment is the subject of a continuing historical controversy.
An unprovoked fact is that the struggle in the mid-17th century has shaped our nation's development further, and Cromwell is one identified figure representing one side of the conflagration at the time.
His achievements as the shield Lord are also worthy of honor and victory."
A deadly pig that drove a Chinese farmer to death.
Local media sources report a return attack on agricultural deaths on the market in southwestern China.
The man, who is known as his family, is found dead with a bad artery when it's covered in blood next to the pig's market in the bloupneshoe market in the province of Guijuo, so the South China Morning Post report is on Sunday.
An agricultural prepares to inject pig vaccines in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Changhai County, China.
According to the reports, he traveled on Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yonan County to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and found a door open to a pighouse.
He said Drey was found a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A criminal investigation confirmed that the pig that weighed 250 pounds attacked the farmer, according to the report.
"My uncle's feet were full of blood and madness," said the cousin named "Wu," as quoted in the Guiyang Evening News.
In security cameras, it looks like Yuan's coming into the market on Thursday morning at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to either his cousin or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked behind bars to prevent him from attacking other people, while the police were collecting evidence at the scene.
It has been said that a negotiation between Juan's family and the market authorities about his death was under way.
Although the phenomenon is rare, it has already been reported in cases where pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused human injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had a farmer's bracelet in Wales to his tractor until the farmer's wife escaped the animal.
After a farmer in Argentina was joined by his pigs in 2012, one of my best farmers told the CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but the taste of blood could be "trigger".
'They're just playing.
They're like naughty, very curious kids... They don't mean to hurt you.
We just have to give them the proper dignity," he said.
The remnants of the hurricane storm, Rosa, will cause heavy rainfall in vast areas of the southwestern United States.
According to the forecast, the hurricane rose weak as it traveled over the colder water on the North Coast of Mexico Bay.
However, the storm, Rosa, will bring my body to the forts all over North Mexico and the south-west of the United States over the next few days.
The ghosts of the Rosa storm reached a speed of 135 miles per hour, that is, the hurricane storm at level 1, and for the first day at 5 a.m. according to the East Coast clock, the center of the storm is located at 620 miles south-east of Punta Eugena, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it begins to form an efface above the Pacific Ocean that traveled east toward the East Coast of the United States, with a approach to half the island of a California sister on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, starting to push a deep tropical winter north into the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, a tropical herd that will combine with the adjacent fraction will produce heavy rainwater in vast areas of the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 100 milligrams of rain will cause dust to suffocate and cause landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will cause the rain to reach 50 to 75 m an hour at different points, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Rains of 50 to 100 millimeter expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially in Arizona.
There will be severe flooding with conditions that deteriorate rapidly due to the spectacular nature of the tropical rain.
It is highly recommended to avoid walking long distances in the desert when there is danger of tropical rain.
A heavy rain may make shopping for hungry rivers and thunderous winds that bring strong winds of dust and dust.
The closer side will bring local rainwaters to parts of South California's coast.
There'll be a total of over 13 millimeters of rain, which can cause waste spills and smooth roads.
It'll be the first rain in this rainy season area.
Terror tropical rainwaters will start approaching Arizona on Sunday night and on Monday morning, and the rain will be strong and spread over Monday and Tuesday.
A heavy rain will spread to the four corners of the corner on Tuesday and last on Wednesday.
October may have severe temperature changes across the United States, while the Arctic region is cooling, but the tropical region remains quite warm.
This situation sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature between short distances.
On Sunday, there's an excellent example of extreme temperature changes across the center of the United States.
There's a temperature difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Emma, Nebraska and St. Louis to de Wayne, Iowa.
In the next few days, we'll try to grow and expand again.
At the beginning of October the temperatures will be warm in most central and eastern regions of the United States, moving between 27 and 31 degrees south and north-east.
In New York City, the temperature may reach 27 degrees a Tuesday, which is about 5 degrees above the average.
Long-term weather forecast shows high-risk temperatures than averaged in the East of the United States at the first half of October.
Over 20 million people were watching the hearing of Bert Kwano
Over 20 million people watched on Thursday, on six television networks, the fascinating testimony of the candidate for the Supreme Court, Bert Kwano, and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 80s of the previous century, Christine Blazy Ford.
In the meantime, the political debate continued, with news flashes in the middle of the normal broadcasts to announce a surprise development on Friday: an agreement elaborated by Senator Mariana G.F.F.F.F.F.P.I. to conduct a weekly investigation to investigate the charges.
Ford told the St.'s Legal Committee that she's 100% sure that we're wearing her body when he's drunk and he's trying to set her up during a high school party.
Kavano, a widowly witness, said he's 100% sure it didn't happen.
The number of viewers is likely to have been even higher than the 20.4 million report.
Nelson's company checked the average viewing of CBS networks, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fax Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people watching the offices.
For the comparison, it's about the audience watching a similar scale of football play or Oscar's ceremony.
According to Nilsen, Fox News Channel, which has been very supportive of Kawano's appointment, has led to an understanding of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day's hearing.
ABC stood second with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nelson's report.
The level of interest remains high after the hearing.
Senator Flick was the main character of the drama that went on Friday.
After the High Republican Senator's office issued a message that he would vote in favour of the appointment of Kawano, he was filmed by CNN and CBS photographers while an protesting group was trying to get into the elevator to get to the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He's been looking down for a few minutes while the protestors were suffocating him, all of which was on live CNN.
"I'm standing here before you," said one of the women.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are helpless."
Felix said that his son had posted a message and said, before the elevator door closed, he'd say more things at the hearing of the committee.
The broadcasting networks and the cable would all be broadcast for a few hours later, when the Legal Committee was about to vote for Kavanault.
But Felix said he'd vote for appointment only on condition that the FBI's understanding would investigate the charges against the candidate over the next week, which was required by the members of the democratic minority.
Felix is partially convinced of his friend, Senator Chris Cons.
After a conversation with Consulate and several cents later, Felix got his decision.
Felix's decision had power, because it was obvious that Republicans wouldn't have much to confirm the appointment of Koano without investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Quano.
Head of the British government, Teresa May, accused the visitors that they're playing politics on the Brixet subject.
Prime Minister Teresa May blamed her planners for leaving the European Union that they were playing in politics with a British future and hit the national Internet in an interview that she gave to the Sunday Times.
The Prime Minister of Britain Teresa May arrives at the meeting of the Guardian Party in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview that appeared alongside her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her check-in game program to Brixite, saying that the proposal that Britain and the European Union would recover this property of this one is totally debased.
The police arrested Diton Simpson as a suspect of the LSU's murder.
The police arrested a suspect in the lethal shootings at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played on the LSU team.
A 20-year-old man named Diton Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for murder at first instance, so he was informed by the Baton Rog police.
Officials have published a video of the symphony dispute, and according to the police, Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said Simpson's DNA was on them, according to a report from the WAFB network, which is part of the CBS network.
After the Simpson investigation, according to the police, he admitted that he had shot Wade to death.
The bail was set at $350,000, as reported in Advocate.
The Pathological Institute of East Batton Rose published a first-day report, which, according to which the cause of death is a gunshot wound in the head and neck.
The police gave credit to the task force for the capture of fugitives from the state police, the state police federal lab, the Soothern University Police and citizens in the area who helped with the investigation that led to the capture of the suspect.
The Director of Ethics at LSU University, Gu'o Alva, thanked the law enforcement authorities in the area for “extremeness and justice”.
Sims was 20.
The Forward Baller, who was over two feet high, grew up in Baton Rose, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU University.
His average last season is 5.6 points and 2.6 bullets are coming back.
Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach, Will Wade, said that the group was "freaking" and "blaming" at Wade's death.
"That's the thing you're afraid of all the time," said Wade.
A volcano rocking ashes on Mexico City.
An ash that came down at the speed of the Popocectal volcano arrived in the southern neighbourhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned the people of Mexico on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the mountain was increased and 183 gas and ash plates were registered over 24 hours.
In the center of Notre, there are noises and noises.
Photos on social networks showed layers of ash cover on cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Sucimilko.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 miles (45 miles) south-east of the capital city, since a 7.1-powered earthquake hit Mexico City in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Guéhent, has been active since 1994.
A police collision with a minor individual near the anniversary to vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on a Saturday after independent protestors clashed with the forces of police in the affected area, while thousands joined in protest against the first anniversary of the party's vote on Catalonia independence.
A group of hard-wraped ballons that were swallowed up by the police for the falcon, thrown the cops on eggs and scattered paint powders, into the creation of black dust clouds on the streets, usually the water in the rivers.
Conflicts also broke out later that day when the cops had to use the words to get over the demonstrators.
For a number of hours, independent groups have been formed that have been singing "unforgettable, unforgettable" in front of members of the so-called "Spainn".
In the local press, 14 people were reported to have received treatment for minor injuries committed by the demonstrators.
The suspensions remain high in the regions of the independents a year after the question of the people held on October 1 was decided by the Spanish government, but were celebrated by the pro-independence Catalians.
The voters chose most of the votes to become an independent country, although the voting holding was low when those who opposed the separation were most disparaging the vote.
Government authorities in Catalonia reported that nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the voting in cards across the area in violent conflicts.
Independent groups have set up camps for Friday night to prevent support from the National Police.
The demonstration was in place but had to take a different course.
Narcisse Throms, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the bickering with his wife, said he had lost hope about the chance of Catalonia getting independent.
Last year we've experienced our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out for joy they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although Hitler’s political parties won an important victory, in the last December, they had difficulty maintaining the momentum of the year when many of their best-known leaders were willing to do so or in prisons awaiting trial for their part of the People’s Question Organization and for its traces of independence.
Juan Fug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded police support on his cell phone, said that the violence was fought by politicians on both sides of the consul.
"It's going crazy," he said.
On Saturday, Uril Yonkers announced one of the nine deadly leaders who have been in prison awaiting trial since last year, that he will run for election to the European Parliament next year.
"to stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to get involved in democratic values and oppression that we would have witnessed from the Spanish government," he says.
Lundondri: A number of men were arrested after a car broke into the house.
Three men -- at 33.34 and 39 years of age -- were arrested after a car broke in a house in London.
The event took place on Thursday, about 19:30, in the United Kingdom clock.
Detective Bob Bellmings said that there was damage to the gates and to the building itself.
At some point, too, a sharp arrow may have been shot past the car.
A pen of a scholarship from Livingston to win 1-0 on Rang's.
First gate of Dolly Manga to Livingston promised the victory
Livingston, who just went up to the league, shocked Ring's and Founder Steven Gerard, it's just his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mangae's kick meant a lot because Gary Holt's team moved up with the Hibranian in second place.
Gerar's team is left unwinned outside the upper league this season, and she's dealing with Leader Harts, who's in the back at eight points next Sunday.
Before that, Rings will host Rafid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone extends the loss-free course to six games at home, and Chief Coach Holt hasn't stopped a farm since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone missed opportunities in front of a weak host.
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before they put a gate down, when their directs caused Rangers to have different problems.
Scott Robinson broke in ahead but dragged his attempts before the gate, and then Alan LaGui could focus his efforts on the other way around just after he slipped in to meet Craig Heggett's approach before the gate.
The hosts were willing to allow Ringer to play before them, knowing they could make it difficult for the group to host with free kicks.
And that was the way the gate was turned.
Herring's got a free kick and Livingston created an opening, Daklan Gallagher and Robinson joined in blocking the manga, which made a touch and locked a gate from the center of the floor.
At this point, Herring's controlled the possession of the ball, but found that the protection of the house is inconclusive, and the hair of Liam Kelly remains almost uncontaminated.
This pattern went to the second half, even though Alfredo Morlos did force Kelly to save the gate.
Scott Pittnam was destroyed by the leg of the Ring's hairman Alan McGergregre and that Guy was touched by an extra free kick of Liwigston.
Cellular pills continued to enter the range of Livingston and to destroy, while two pills of punishment -- after a felony on the replacement Glen Medelton -- and one on a hand touch -- were removed.
"Millingston" - surgery
Alstair Monnet, BBC Scotland, Tony McCarney Stadium
An amazing game and an amazing result from Milwingston.
All the players were excellent, and they continued to look forward to this movement.
Their game style and the players haven't changed since they've returned to the lead position, but there's got to be a lot of credit for the way he's locked up the team since they arrived.
He had so many stars.
Captain Holctor was awesome, leading a very well-organized defense, while Manga kept Connor Goldson and Wu Waral at high altitudes all along the way.
Herring's hall, however, was uninspirationed.
Even though they were pretty good sometimes under Gharar, they didn't stand by those standards.
They were missing the final ball -- only once they opened up the home team's defense -- and it was a red shot to the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the field.
A welcome involved with Ardovan Callen.
There were blue smiles and skyscrapers when Turkish and German leaders met on Saturday (September 29,) for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan in Germany -- whose purpose was to repair the relationship between the two member states of the Natsu League.
They had opinions about such characteristics as human rights, press freedom and the reception of Turkey for the European Union.
From there, Erdovan continued to participate in the opening of a new giant mosque.
Klan is the town with the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police announced the safety reasons for the 25,000 people's public block from collecting on the front of the mosque, but many supporters have come together to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters — many of whom are blacks — have also heard their voice, arguing that they are on Erdovan's policy lines and that they have decided Germany to welcome him to the country.
The rival protestors reflect the controversy around the guest that some of the Turks in Germany sing him as a hero and others defend him as a fan.
A car accident in Duftford: a bike rider killed in a car crash.
A biker was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The crash took place near the street crossing in Stewood and Wallen, a busy road in Duftford, southeastern of the city, about 10:15 a.m. Britain's clock.
The car driver stopped and had to take care of the wound, but the man died instead.
The collision came after another bike was killed in a hit-and-run on Childer Street, about a mile from the scene on Saturday.
The City Police said that cops were trying to identify the murder and inform his relatives.
Instead of being blocked and bused for alternative routes, drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Prison Long Lartin: six guards were injured in a riot.
Six guards were injured in a riot at a men's secure prison, so the prison office's message.
The riot broke out at the Lung Lertin prison in Westershire on Sunday around 9:30 a.m., and it's still on.
Special officers from the Toronto unit were brought to the scene to eliminate the riot, which included eight prisoners and one-sided exiles.
Guards were treated instead of minor injuries inside.
The Prisons Service Speaker said: "Skilled guards are particularly trained to deal with an ongoing event at the Long Lartin prison.
Six guards were treated for injuries.
We don't get violent in our prisons, and we're clear that those involved will be brought to the police and their jail periods may be extended."
Prison Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June he was reported to have been treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year the FZG officers were called to prison to deal with a serious riot where guards were attacked by snoker sticks.
The hurricane of the hurricane is threatening the flood of lightning in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's rare that Tropics hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's expected to happen at the beginning of next week, when the remnants of the hurricane rose to the south-east desert and put them at risk to live with them.
The National Weather Service has already announced a threat to terrorist activity in two and a third days for Western Arizona into south-east Nevada, south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Pynix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The storm is expected to take a direct course over Phoenix on Tuesday, and approach the end of Monday with rain.
The national weather service in Phoenix published a Twitter that only “ten tropical cicadas have remained in a tropical storm status or a 322-mile tropical earthquake since 1950!
Katarina storm (1967) was a hurricane in a range of 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest models of Arizona's hurricane-society center are watching 50 to 100 millimeters of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 millimeters in Arizona's mogulon.
Other areas in the south-west desert, including the Great Rocky Mountains, are expected to have 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of being isolated places to have a total of 50 millimeters.
To those outside the area at risk of flash flood, the rain of the Rosa storm may be a blessing because the area has suffered from a form.
Although the floods are a serious threat, some of these rains will be helpful because the south-west region is currently suffering from conditions of shape.
According to the U.S. pattern of tracking, over 40% of marijuana is in a tough form, which is the second category in the compound, so report a Web site.com.
First, a route of the Rosa storm will reach the mainland across the island at a California farm in Mexico.
Rosa's storm, still on the Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 miles per hour, is about 20 miles south of Punta Eugena, Mexico, and is north of about 20 km per hour.
The storm hit colder in the Pacific Ocean, thus weakening.
So she's expected to reach the mainland in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm in the afternoon or the evening of Monday.
Rains across parts of Mexico may be heavy and cause severe flooding.
"Inclusive rain amounts of 75 to 150 millimeter expected from the Council of California to the north-west of Sonora, with a chance of up to 250 millimetres" reports a Web site.com.
After that, Rosa's storm continues into Mexico with tropical money, before you reach the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical cliff, and then continues on into South Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger to be expected from Rosa, or from the rest of her, is heavy rains in Bhaja, California, south-west of Sonora, and the south-west desert in the United States", the message of the National Centre for the hurricane.
These rains are expected to cause severe droughts, life - threatening floods in the desert, and landslides in the mountainous regions.
Medsmer Norton assault: four arrested for attempted murder
Three boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old girl was found with stab wounds in the Swammerst.
The boy was injured in the Messmer Norton Excelor Tras area on Sunday around 4:00 a.m. by Britain's watch.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remained in a stable state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, Aboon and Samarst according to the myth.
The cops are asking anyone who might have got cell phones of what happened to him to contact the police.
Trump said that Koano suffered the evils and the anger of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favour of Judge Kwano is the vote to reject the egregious spirit and tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump in a arrest in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said that he had been "suffering the evils, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his entire appointment process.
Kavanau testified to Congress on Thursday, actively and slowly denying the charge of Christine Blazy Ford that he had sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified to the hearing about her guilt.
The president said on Saturday that the "U.S. residents saw Kwano's brilliant quality and courage" on the same day.
"The vote to confirm the appointment of Judge Kwano is the vote to confirm the appointment of one of the most remarkable legal minds in our time, a man of justice with a great history of public service", he told the audience his supporters in West Virginia.
The President took note of the appointment of Kavanau when he spoke of the importance of Republicans coming to vote in the mid-decade election.
Five more weeks to one of the most important votes in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm actually a candidate," he said.
That's why I'm running everywhere to fight for great candidates.
Trump claimed that the democracies are on mission to "oppose and interrupt".
A senior assistant at the Republican Party is a message to the CNN that the first central prosthetic vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavano is expected to exist not later than Friday.
Hundreds are killed by an earthquake and a tsunami in Indonesia, and the number is rising.
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were swept away by huge waves, when a severe earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian Sulavesian island, thus reporting official sources on Saturday.
A lot of people gathered to the beach festival in Palo City on Friday, when waves at a height of 6 feet (18 feet) crashed onto the beach at sunset, carried many to their death and destroyed everything in their way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-power earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat woke up yesterday, people were still doing business on the beach and were not immediately escaped, and they fell victim," said Sutopo Foro Noroho, the BNPB Disaster Management Agency, in a briefing at Akata.
"He didn't come by himself, he dragged cars, logs, houses, he hit everything on the ground," he said, adding that the consul advanced over the open sea at 800 miles (497 miles per hour) before striking the shoreline.
Some of the people took care of trees to escape the consul and they survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people turned 24 centers in Pallo.
Air footage published by the Disaster Agency have shown destruction to a large number of homes and shops, turf bridges and trimmings and a mosque surrounded by water.
A major shock continued to shake the beach city on Saturday.
The earthquake is killing in a region where 2.4 million people live.
The Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) in Indonesia stated that the energy released on the Friday World War II was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb that had been released.
According to him, the city's geography, which sits at the edge of a long, narrow bay, may have raised the size of the tsunami.
Noroho described the destruction as "heavy" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were trapped under the debris of damaged buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Norrous said that the number of deaths and damage could be larger along North Pala with a 300-mile-mile-mile shoreline, a region called Dongla, and closer to the earthquake area.
The media, "Charera and there's no information" at Dunella, said Noroho.
The Red Cross said in a statement that his people and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
It's a tragedy now, but things can get much worse, he said.
On Saturday, there was a lot of criticism of the agency for not declaring that the defendant had hit Pallo, although official sources said that the waves had arrived while the warning was published.
In a violent video broadcast on social networks, you can see a man on a high roof of a building screaming hysterical warnings about the tsunami coming to people on the street beneath him.
In minutes a wall of water crashs on the beach, carrying buildings and cars with him.
The News Agency was unable to make sure that the photo was authentic.
The tremor and the tsunami caused large power breaks that interrupted the press around Palo and insisted on the authorities to coordinate the rescue efforts.
The army began sending aircraft with assistance from Akarta and other caves, according to authorities, but survivors still desperately need food and other essential supplies.
The city's airport was opened only for aid efforts and kept closed until October.
President Juko and his team were planned to visit the rescue centers in Pallo on Sunday.
The number of deaths in Indonesia has increased to over 800.
It's very difficult.
While the World Association's people arrived safely in Palo City, where shelter workers are made of a tarpaulin set up in the courtyards of their offices, they passed through visions of destruction on their way, said Mr. Dozba.
"They told me they saw many houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's very difficult.
Even while relief teams began with the unfortunate operations of the relief effort, the complaint was that you were prevented from arriving at a highly experienced relief worker.
According to Indonesia's regulations, funding, supplies and people from other countries can only be set aside if the affected area is known as a national disaster zone.
This thing hasn't been done yet.
"It's still defined as a disaster at a district level," said Olya Ariani, speaking of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can open the door to international assistance, but this status has just been announced."
With the second night on Palo after the earthquake on Friday, friends and family members of the missing ones were held in the hope that their blessings would be the miracles explaining the sad stories of natural disasters.
Saturday, a little boy's snuck out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue men rescued a woman buried under ruins for two days, with her mother's body next to her.
Gordon Sovando, coach of Indonesia's D.A.L.L.L. team, trained two missing shelter parkers to Asian games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others understand that being trapped at a visual hotel, including Mr. Mandgi, were his disciples.
I'm carrying my own emotional burden, he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how during the news of the collapse of a hotel he saw in a crowd in the host community, he faithfully sent messages to the competitions in Palu, who took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages showed only one sign of gray criticism, instead of a pair of blue marks.
I think the meaning is that the messages have not been delivered, he said.
Stealers took $26,750 during the filling of an ATM at the Newport on the Livee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 from a bank account full of cash at the Newport on the Livee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.

Rafer changed his name to Ye.
Raffer Kenya and St change his name to Yee.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The woman who was known as Kenya West."
And 41-year-old West was called "You" for a while and he used the nickname as his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change comes first to his show on the Satardi Night Lake TV show, where he's expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
He replaced the singer Ryan Granda who canceled her participation because of emotional reasons, so he said the designer of the program.
In addition to the shortness of his current professional name, St said in the past that a word has religious meaning for him.
"I think 'e' is the most common word in the Bible, and the word "you" in the Bible is "you", and st said earlier this year, when he talked about the name Album with the radio deren Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It's moved from Kenya, which means the one and only, to just the reflection of the good that he built, the evil that he built, or the confused, all.
The album is more reflections of who we are."
He's one who understands some famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Kombes was informed of a replacement named Puff Dady, Peddy or Diddy, but the year he declared that he preferred the names  haveh love and "brotherly love".
West's former partner, J.Z., also went through his name's versions with and without a map and licenses.
The President of Mexico committed not to use the army against civilians.
The elected President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lops Oberdor, committed never to use military force against civilians, as the state approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody persecution against students.
Lops Oberdor promised on Saturday at the Tuttleco Square "Never Use the Army to Depress the Mexican People".
An army shot at the non-violent demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, and killed about 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
Lops Oberdor committed to supporting young Mexicans by providing financial support to those who study and open up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of access to education were pressing young people into crime gangs.
The United States needs to double the funding of an artificial building.
With China's industrial understanding activity advanced, the United States needs to double the amount it invests in research in the field, thus saying that the investigator in the field of artificial understanding Kai-po-li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His words come after parts of the U.S. government have published declarations of artificial intelligence, even at a time when the U.S. government does not have an official artificial intelligence strategy.
In the meantime, China presented her plan last year: it's going to be number 1 in an artificial building by 2030.
"The double budget of the study in the field of artificial understanding will be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we're looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial understanding," he told me.
The double funding could double the chances that the next great artificial achievement would be achieved in the U.S., told the CNBC network at the interview this week.
Lee, who reported "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was released on the month's issue by Hoghton Mifflin Harcourt.
In the previous 80s at the University of Carnegie Hotel, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the first U.S. executive player, and later served as senior leader of the Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch of China.
I've been familiar with previous US government technological competitions, such as the Agency's robotics challenge for advanced research projects, and ask when you'll be next, to help identify the next vision people.
U.S. researchers often need to work hard to win government grants, tell me.
"It's not China that's sending us the leading researchers at the Academy, it's the business companies that do this," he told me.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years raised stars from universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
I said that migration policy changes could also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial understanding.
"I think you should automatically propose Green Card to my PhD, in the field of artificial understanding," he said.
In July 2017, China State Council published its artificial intelligence program for the next generation.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences grants funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations of the U.S. Department of Rates for Investigators, but the academic quality of work is lower in China, according to me.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an artificial centre for the evening of industry and the Academy, and the White House announced the establishment of a special and artificial white committee.
And the month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative in the field of artificial understanding under the name AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, a U.S. legislation initiative designed to create a National Security Committee and an artificial structure has not been operational for months.
The people of Macedonia point to a question with the question whether to change the name of the country.
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia ask the question whether to change their name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, a step that will resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that prevented her from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern region is a complaint for Greece's territory and for its accession to NATO and the European Union.
Both countries signed in June a deal based on the new name in question, but they oppose the Athenians claiming that the change would affect the ethnic identity of the majority of the population in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote in the question of the people and the campaign of war that cast doubt on the question whether the voting would be at a minimum of 50 percent required for the people to be attacked.
The question in the voting note is, "Is it for NATO and the European Union to accept the Greek agreement?"
Whoever supports the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, claims that this is a price worth worth to be paid so that Macedonia, which is one of the countries that have been created by Yugoslavia, can join bodies like the European Union and NATO.
"I came today to point out the future of the state for young people in Macedonia so that they could live free under the European Union's umbrella, because it means a safe life for all of us," said Olivera George's 79th-year-old in Scotia.
Although the people's question is not a legal requirement, enough members of Parliament said that they would follow the voting results to make it a ring.
To change the name, it would take a majority of two-thirds of the Parliament.
The State Elections Committee said there were no regularizations at 13:00.
However, the percentage of voters stood at only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last election to Parliament in 2016, of whom 66 percent of the voting rights were due to vote.
"I came to vote for my kids, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Musa Tanbsky, in the city of Scophia.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zeev, his wife, Zoroka, and his son Duko complete their ballot in Stromish, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, on the question of the people in Macedonia about a change in the name of the country, which will open the door to NATO and the European Union.
On the front of the Parliamentary House in Scooie, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawarderkov made small seats in front of the tentmakers who created those who respected the people's wishes.
"We're in favour of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join the top of an ape, not through the entrance of the servants," said Kawardrov.
We're a poor country, but we have respect.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zeev said that NATO companies would bring the most needed investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour of over 80% of our citizens supporting the European Union and NATO," said Zeev after the vote.
He said a positive result would be our future security.
A survey published on Monday by Macedonia's Policy Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would share in the public question -- less than the required participation.
Another question, made by the TV media Tele TV, found that 57 of the delegates were planning to vote on Sunday.
From them, 70% said they'd vote yes.
In order for the people to ask, the percentage of voters should be at least 50% plus one.
The failure of the wish would be the first significant loss of the policy of the Pwro-West Government since it seized May's power last year.
Video: Manchster City player, Agroro ranger, steered through all of Britton's defenses to hit a gate.
Agroro and Sterling's Shepherds attacked the defense of Bryton in the 2-0th victory of Manzster City on Saturday at the Abhaad Stadium in Manster, England.
Looks like Agaro was wearing the gate easy.
The Argentine explorer got a delivery in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Britton's defense players before hacking into the open field.
At this point Agauro found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one shield before he got a few more shields on the British's wide border.
Then he kicked to the left and found Sterling.
The English pioneer used his first touch over the floor to deliver the ball back to Agaro, which hit the right leg beat the Bryton, Matthew Ryan, with a bullet to the right side of the network.
Agroro has problems with his feet, said a director of Mansster City for reporters.
We agreed he'd play about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he was wearing a gate at the moment."
But it was Sterling that gave the 'heavens Capture' the initial advantage of opposing the superhero.
This gate came in the 29th minute.
Agaro got the ball deep in Briton's territory during this.
He sent a great cross-section across the right wing to Leroy Sana.
Sana ran the ball before he led Sterling to the far-sighted.
A heavenly blue player pushed the ball into the network right before he slipped out of the field.
Manzster City will face fashions in the League of Nations game on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rain-Nar Stadium in Zinsehi, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play Spoiler in front of the Roques.
With the Escionales coming out of the playoffs, there was no good reason to force another start.
But Charles, who is very competitive, hopes to win on Sunday in front of Colorado Rockis, but only if there are still consequences for the playoffs for the Roques, leading to one game on the L.A. D.'s at the NL West League.
Herques shot themselves at least a place of open card with the 5-2 win on the Nsionles on Friday night, but they never promised their first place at home.
"Although we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play knowing the atmosphere here in Denver with the viewers and the other team will play at the highest level, probably at every point I'm going to face you this year.
Why wouldn't I want to deal with it?"
The Neschenles have just announced the start of the first day, but according to reports, they tend to let the Charles serve in such a situation.
Schazar, which would be his 34th start, had a Bolpan training value on Thursday and will be due on his day of rest -- Sunday.
Washington's right-hand exhibit is a download of 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikes in 220 rounds 2/3 this season.
Trump is standing in West Virginia.
The President pointed to the situation around his elected candidate for the Supreme Court, Bert Kwano, while he spoke of the importance of Republicans coming to vote in the middle of the priesthood.
“ Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five more weeks for the most important election in our lives.
It's one of the biggest, the most-- I'm not dealing, but actually I'm running, and that's why I'm running everywhere and fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on and said, "You see this horrible group of extremists, you see it happening right now.
And if you're determined to take back the power by whatever means it takes, you'll see the evils, the defeats.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they need to run to get power and control, that's what they want is power and control, we're not gonna give them it."
Democracies are, according to him, on mission to "oppose and interrupt".
"And you see it during the last four days," he said, and called the democracies "wronged, mean, and mean."
He mentioned the humble leader of the St. John's Legal Committee, the Democratic Senator Diane Finstein, who has caused a high level of public reading.
Remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I waited up-- it was really a bad body language-- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Leaburg Party is no longer a philosophical place.
She's not suffering from those who express their opinion.
When the Mommon Movements at my local party branch voted to scold me, it wasn't quite a surprise.
After all, I'm the last in the line of members of the Parliament from the Laibere who were told that they were not welcome -- and only because we've been suing our minds.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, won the same treatment because she actively stood up against anti-Semitics.
In my case, the decision to rape me was a visit to me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe -- most of the irony -- subjects similar to those of their ladies Jeremy disagrees with previous party leaders.
At the Committee on the East Nottingham Laiber Party meeting on Friday it was said that "we want the meeting to be full and pragmatic."
For most of my eight years as a member of a local parliament from the Leaburg Party, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday night were exactly the same.
Today, however, it is not the pleasure of many to approach and promise “more kind, gentleer” politics has long been forgotten, even if it has ever started.
It turns out more and more that the Labour Party has no tolerance for different seizures, and every opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptance of the party's leadership.
This situation began soon after Jeremy was elected to the party head, when colleagues who had previously thought that we were sharing a similar political view began to expect him to make a version of it and to take on positions that I would never agree with -- whether about national security or about a single European market.
Every time I speak in public -- and it doesn't really matter what I say -- there comes an abusive carpet of evidence in social networks with repulsion calls, the political repudiation of the center and the health that I don't need to be at the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than my colleagues, because the notes about me tend to be political.
I am familiar with the professionalism and determination of the same colleagues who face a wave of racial abuse every day but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this age of politics is how levels of abuse have become a matter of common concern.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Labour party had to cultivate a culture of intolerance.
The reality is that we're already the same place as a florist, and with any decision to "untrust" or change of choice, the party becomes more critical.
Over the past two years, I've been having trouble keeping my mouth shut, not being so loud, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not what I got into politics for.
Since I joined the Labour party 32 years ago as a school student, I have been bitten by the abandonment of the government of Thecher which caused my class to almost collapse, I have been looking for ways to fight better social services for those who need them most -- whether as a member of a local council or as a government expert.
I've never hidden my political opinions, including in the last election.
No one in the East of Nottingham could in any way confuse my political positions and my differences with the current leadership.
For those who made the decision on Friday, all I have to say is that while the country crawls to the Braquette to hurt our families, business and public service, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Laavor leader.
But to be honest, the one message I have is not to move momentum in Nottingham, but to the public of my choice, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no amount of my rejection or political benefit will appeal to me to perform in a way I believe that you all have the best interests of all.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbundled air to the top
Two final freshs have little to do with the final outcome, but there is no doubt that air is worthy of victory in today's big, big game in the Soviet super-scotty.
They're now at the top of the table, the unscathed only side of the age.
In the end, it was their best defense, as well as taking a lot more risks, playing for the home team, and coach Peter Morchei had all the reasons to be happy.
"We've been tested in our games so far, and we're still not defeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christy from the Melrose Group said, "Lair is coming all credit, they've taken better risks than us."
Grant Anderson's flight on the 14th, Fraser Clem, put Air in the lead position, but a yellow card for Scotland Rory Hughes team player released to play by the Verawares, enabled Meloz to get points and Jason Baghot caught Trey who didn't say.
Callimo picked up Air's lead with a felony, before he was actually half gone, and then Mary Trey Solo got 17-5 to air in half.
But Melrose opened up the second half well and Terry Patrick Anderson, spoken of by Gout, narrowed the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury of Rodrich Knout, taken away in Alonka, and starting with the re-playing of the game, Air increased the gap through the Trey Road of Stafford McDowell, which was proclaimed by Clemo.
The captain's captain, Air Blair McParson Sponge, then a yellow card, and again Melrose used the other person with Trey who didn't play Bruce Collwin, at the end of a series of great pressure.
But the house team recovered, and when Stern Tachinson got a yellow card on the bulletless attack of Clemo, the punishment line, from the Tach Down port from behind Air's advanced mile.
Calimo Hamir, as he did almost again from the game back, after Kyle Roy Ss beat David Armstrong's boxing and sent the Greger Henry to the sixth train of the house team.
Star Still Game seems ready for a new career in restaurants
Star Still Game, Ford Kirnan, seems to be ready to move to the restaurant branch after it was discovered that he was designated director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of 'Kack G'arvis in BBC's popular program, which he writes and sits down with his old comdia partner, Greg the elephant.
The other side announced the next ninth season would be the final season of the program, and it looks like Kirnan is planning life after Creling.
According to official records, he's the manager of Adrefthorn Limited.
The actor refused to respond to the story, although a source of the S.N.A. suggests that Karinan was looking for ways to get into the successful restaurant business in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours: 'Bolivia who doesn't find a sea, hope the court will open up a path to the Pacific.'
Fleets fly at the Navy headquarters in a few ships in Bla Paz.
Public buildings play blue flags.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon carry the password: "The sea is ours by right.
It's our duty to sue him back."
Throughout Bolivia, which does not find a sea, the memory of a shoreline that lost its value in bloody issues over resources in the 19th century is still alive -- as well as chemistry to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes may have been shared for decades, while Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of discussions.
"Lolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course it expects from a positive attitude to the signal," said Roberto Clesdilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will sign the International Court's decision on the basis of major agreements throughout the country, hoping that the Hagg Court will decide in the interest of Bolivia's demand that in the next decades of debates there be negotiations on the granting of sovereign access to Bolivia.
Bolivia's chrysistic newborn wife, Ou Morals, who is faced with a conflict in conflict with the next year's re-election -- hangs a lot of decision on Monday.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But interpreters think that there's no chance that the court will be in favour of Bolivia -- and that even if it decides to do so, it won't change much.
The U.S. court sitting in Hagg does not have any authority to grant a territory of Chila, stating that it will not determine the results of possible calls.
The fact that the International Court's statement came only six weeks after the hearing of the agreed arguments indicates that the case was "not complicated", but Paz Zarata, a Chilean international trial specialist.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's claims, they may have been weakened by the past four years.
"At sea access has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian government," said Zarata.
Morals ’ war history has destroyed every remnant of the good will of Cila, according to her.
At some point Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to discuss after this.
Both countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodriguez and the warrant, a representative of Bolivia in Hagg, rejected the idea that the court hearing was exceptionally quick.
On Monday, Bolivia gets a great opportunity to start a new era of relations with the Cilla and to risk "Friend for the 139 years of disagreement for the benefit of both sides", he said.
Clazadilla also denied Morales that he is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, making use of the issue of the sea as a political landscape.
Bolivia would never give up her right to access the Pacific, he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear damage would not happen unless she could trust the U.S.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea, Rey Young, said I'd never want to unload the nuclear weapon first if she couldn't trust Washington.
Ree's on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called the United States to keep the promises given during the summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival states.
His words appear to be coming from the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompau, on the threshold of a reopening of diplomatic contacts on nuclear weapons that came to an end more than three months after the summit in Singapore with a leader in North Korea, Kim Gong One.
Rey said it was "a dream in Asphamia" to think that the continued sanctions and opposition of the United States to declare the end of the Korean War would force North Korea to bow down.
The U.S. is afraid to agree to a declaration without North Korea first taking significant steps to launch a nuclear weapon.
They're Kim and the president of the United States, Donald Trump, interested in top two.
However, there is widespread doubt that North Korea is serious about its nuclear weapon position, where it is likely to see the only way to protect its safety.
Pompto plans to visit Pyongyang next month to set a second summit between Kim and Tramp.
A fashion show in Paris reveals the new terrence in huge hats found on his way to store everywhere.
We'll find the solution for anyone who wants to expand the collection of hats or get complete protection from the sun.
The designers, Valentino and Tom Brown were exposed to a series of huge, crazy head coverings for their SS19 coroner, in a fashion show, which was repulsing the style scene in the fashion week in Paris.
Unexpected hats in the night have taken off the summer Instagram, and these designers have brought their extraordinary works to the fashion display course.
Valentino's brilliant item was an over-colored balconia that was sewn together in a wide range of breaths that covered the heads of the models.
Other known-size accessories included tied carpets, a magic hat and even anaesthetics -- but they weren't meant to protect their head from the cold.
Tom Brown also revealed a strange mask selection-- check in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks included more beautiful lips and a thicker blood for Hannibal Lecter than for Hout Kutor.
One piece mentioned a salinity mask, including a silhouette and glasses, and another looked like a fine ice cream cup.
And who would like to continue with a huge-scale fashion statement -- their time has come.
Opticists watch the giant hills make their way to expensive stores everywhere.
The giant hats are the next hit after the Bomba, the hard hat with a half-metre square that's been seen on everyone's head, starting with Mariana and Emily Retiyakowski.
The Calat Loybe behind the very unpaved hat that was watching the social networks produce another big piece of work on the track -- a heavy sea bag of almost as large as that of a seaweed model that carried it.
The written burn-colored film file, with white-skinned cores, was a prominent item in the SS19 collection of Jacqueline La Rivira in the fashion week in Paris.
"I'm watching big hats and big seaweeds come to the store next summer -- because the design made a huge impression and it's hard to ignore the desperate demand for super-spheres."
Jon Edward: Language skills are essential to the citizens of the world.
The schools of independence in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, which went on in 2018 with a further collection of extraordinary test results, which is supported by personal and group success in sports, art, music and other activities in the community.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), are ready to give the best level of service to students and teachers.
Independent schools are eager to prepare their students for further and higher education, for a career they will be chosen and placed as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector capable of planning and absorbing a program of study in personal harmony, we find that modern languages continue to be popularized as a desirable field of study at school.
Nelson Mandela said, "Speaking with a man in a language he understands, it got into his head.
Speaking of a man in his own language, it came into his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can't rely solely on English when we want to build connections and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the last test this year, you can see that languages are at the top of tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages, got a high A score.
The data collected from the 74 schools with SCIS members showed that 72 percent of students had achieved a higher A score in the National, as well as 72% of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish.
These data show that schools of independence in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and youth will no doubt need in the future.
Today, the field of languages is considered to be at the same level as the subjects of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the school curriculums of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the British Employment and Skills Council found that between the reasons that employers mentioned to a code for filling available jobs, 17% was covered by language skills.
Thus, to a greater and greater extent, language skills are essential to preparing students for future careers.
The rise in language requirements for future job opportunities is evident, these skills are essential in the world of globalization.
Whatever career a person will choose, if he learns a second language, he will have a significant future advantage because of this lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries is automatically stable and a person is in a competitive position.
According to a 2013 UK survey of over 4,000 adults, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a level that was sufficient for a conversation, and French was the only language in which there was a double-sex number of percent speaking, 15%.
That's why it's important to invest in the instruction of languages for children today.
Knowledge of many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, every school will be different as to the languages we learn.
Some of the schools will focus on classical languages more, while others will learn languages that are considered to be of the utmost importance for Britain with a view to changing the 20th century, such as Nordic and Japanese.
No matter what the kid's business is, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in the independent schools, with a team of teachers who specialize in the field.
The schools of independence in Scotland are obliged to provide a learning environment that prepares children and hunts them with the skills needed to succeed, in every anticipated future.
Today, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so this fact should be reflected in education.
Indeed, there are modern languages of International Communication Skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, pride and excellence to Scotland's children.
It's an hour's order.
Jon Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is expected to play for the first time in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is over for fans waiting to see LeBron James play for the first time in the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lykers coach, Luke Walton, announced that James would play the pre-season game open to Denver Ngets on Sunday in San Diego.
But we haven't set a few minutes before, he'll play.
It'll be more than one and less than 48, written on Lakers' official website.
Lakers Mike Trudell posted on Twitter that probably James would play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers' pre-season games.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Trump's arrest time in West Virginia, Utopian Channel
President Donald Trump has opened an election stop at Willing, Virginia system.
This is the first of five planned Trump arrests this week, including arrests in friendly places like Nancy and Mississippi.
While voting approval of his appointment to the Supreme Court judge, Trump is building support for the forthcoming mid-colonial elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's arrest in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's arrest in Welling, West Virginia, is scheduled to start at 19:00, according to the East Coast clock, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's arrest in West Virginia on the Internet in the direct flow of the Eutiv.
Tramp is likely to be referring to the hearings held this week for the candidate to the Supreme Court, Bert Kwano, and have become a hotbed around the charges of improper sexual conduct and following the rejection of the vote in St. John's week while the FBI investigates the charges.
But the main objective of this siege has been to help the Republicans facing challenging choices in November to gain some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's election headquarters said that the target of these five arrests next week is “a volunteer and supportive incentive while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of them in St. and House of Choices”, according to Roiters.
"control in Congress is so critical to his agenda, until the President is willing to visit as many countries as possible with the entrance to the extended election season," he told Reiter to speak to the Trump campaign who asked to stay in a dream.
The tonight's arrest, which is scheduled to be held at Wesbanko Stadium in Welling, can bring support from Ohio and Pennsylvania and pull a press cover from the Pittsburgh press, to the West Virginia St. Matthews.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Tramp is visiting West Virginia, the country where he won over 40 percent in 2016.
Trump's trying to help the Republican candidate to St. John's West Virginia, Patrick Morrisi, who's in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morsi that the president should come to try to improve his situation in the polls," said Simon Heider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Rutter.
The U.S. team shows the right to fight to maintain hope for my only games on Sunday.
After three consecutive scans, the four games on Sunday afternoon may be exactly what the Ryder Cup needs.
Momentum's motive is an entirely found sports concept, but players really believe in it, and never more than in contests like this.
So where do they think the momentum is now?
"They've had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so you can see a little momentum in it," said Journe Speth at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has four points ahead with 12 more in the game.
But, as Speth says, Americans feel that they have a little wind in the sails, and they have a lot to cheer up, and not the last of them in the form of a couch, and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them is three points in four.
Speth was a killer from Tie to Green and is a personal leader.
The joys grew as his rounds continued, when he drowned a critical Pat to win the game four all-square and Thomas went down two after two.
His Pit who won the 15on game won a similar cry, the kind that shows he believes that the American team still has hope.
"You really just need to dig deep and just worry about your own game," said Speth.
That's all that's left for each of these players to do.
18 nations to leave a seal.
And Thomas, the only players with more points in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flintwood, the unprovoked lead story of the Ryder Cup.
The weird, but charming, Europeans are four out of four and win everyone's faith.
"Mollywood" was the only pair that didn't hit over the device on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back 9:00 a.m. on Friday morning.
The same turn, and the way their energy appears to flow to and from the eager crowd, bases the fact that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there will be no more popular actor than Playwood or Molinari to sign the European potential victory with the sun hanging on the L Golf National golf course.
It's better for both of them to be at the same time as different nations.
However, it's too early to talk about European fame.
The doll and Tasson Web Simpson finished with Sergeo Garcia, morning's four-ball hero, when he robbed you with Alex Norre.
Boogie and two times the front nines took the Spanish and the muskers into the hole that they didn't get close to getting out of it.
However, on Sunday there's nobody to help you get out of the hole.
It's fascinating to look closely at the four pills and fours because of the interactivity between the two sides, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way strategy can change in the setting of an eye.
Europe has played a better team so far and significantly towards the last day, but this fourth tooth has shown that the American team is filled with the spirit of battle, which has been cast in doubt, mainly within the United States.
Europe leads 10-6 to the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is in a healthy orbit towards the last day of the Ryder Cup after completing the four ball games and the four Saturday games by 10-6 in front of the United States.
A full-blown match of the Fletwood Warnsco Molinnery led to the change with two wins on the wrestling Wads Tiger, and raised the gap so far at the Le Golf National for four points.
The European side players of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to protect the cup that they lost in Hezlstein two years ago, ruled in front of the Americans who missed the four ball games this morning, and brought the series to 3.1.
The American players showed a lot more resistance to the four games, and they won two games, but they couldn't close the gap.
To continue holding the cup, Jim Porrick's friends need eight of the 12 single games.
Fletwood is the first European trojan to win four points in a row, while he and Mullinnery, who won the name "Moliwood" after an extraordinary weekend, are just the second pair that won four points from their four opening games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four ball games, they continued with amazing harmony together to defeat the brainwoods and the American trailer Bryson Dachumbao as a result of more than 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself across two games on Saturday, showed random explosions of excellent, but so far he lost 19 out of 29 games of four and four, and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting during the four ball games of the morning, returned to join Henrik Stanson in the four games to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coke -- first and third in the world.
Yet, not everything went easily to European players in the favorable weather and the calm wind that came to the southwestern part of Paris.
The Bolt winner three times Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas set the floor for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a two-and-one victory over John Ram from Spain and Ian Polter in the four-ball games and later returned to defeat Peter and Rory McLeroy 4 and 3 in the four games, after losing the first two bodies.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup team came back from a negative four-point gap to the only games, though as the handlers of the Cup, the people of Porrick just need to be kicked to keep holding the Cup.
After two days in second place, however, the attack on Sunday seems to be beyond their ability.
North Korea says that "in no way" she's not going to break down a unilateral weapon without trust.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea announced on a Saturday in the United States that further sanctions reinforce her mistrust in the United States and that there is no way the state would unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Rey Yong Hu announced at the UN's annual General Assembly that North Korea has committed itself to a significant “good will” in the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear missile tests, the launch of the nuclear testing site and the commitment not to develop further nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we don't see any match on the part of the U.S.," he said.
Without trust in the United States, we can't be sure about our national protection and under such conditions and we won't be released first by ourselves unilaterally by nuclear weapons.
While Rey returned to North Korea's well-known complaints about the United States' resistance to nuclear detachment, that North Korea would be rewarded as it took steps to take action, his statement seemed important because it did not reject nuclear detonation, as it had previously done in North Korea.
Ree referred to a joint announcement made by Kim Gong-on and Donald Trump on the first peak of history between an American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim committed himself to the "nuclear explosion of the South Korean" while Trump promised to protect the security of North Korea.
North Korea has requested an official end to the Korean War, which took place in 1950-1953, but the United States said that North Korea must give up its nuclear weapons first.
The U.S. also resisted the calls to reduce international sanctions on North Korea.
The U.S. insists on "nuclear detonation first" and increases the pressure of the sanctions to achieve its purpose in the path of fatigue, and even resists "to announce the end of the war", says Rey.
"The perception that sanctiones can cause us to bow down is a dream in the espresso of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is, the dirty sanctions reinforce our mistrust."
Ree never mentioned the plans for the second summit between Kim and Tramp, which was highlighted by the President of the United States on his own a week earlier.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea, Moon Jae-Yain, and added: "If the other side of the nuclear-discharge type was South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear destruction of the South Korean island would not have ended. "
However, Ri's own breath was dramatically different from last year's, so he told the United Nations General Assembly that the United States attack on North Korea's missiles was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump named Kim "Rocket Man" in the suicide mission.
Last year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened North Korea's "complete destruction", commended Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said that there was still a lot more work to do and that the sanctions had to stay in the cloud up to North Korea's nuclear fire.
On Wednesday, Trump said he doesn't have a set time frame for this, adding that "if it takes two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claimed that the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for steps taken.
However, the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompau, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with determination and not stop until we have achieved a complete and complete nuclear explosion."
The Security Council has supported one action in North Korea since 2006 in trying to block funding for its ballistic and nuclear missile plans.
Pompto met with Ree at the United Nations General Assembly and then said he'd be visiting Pyongyang again next month to prepare the next top.
Pompto has been visiting three times this year in North Korea, but his last visit has not come well.
He left E Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for setting the requirements of "Gangster".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon the month to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear facility, if the United States will take action accordingly.
He said Kim told him that the "corresponding steps" he was interested in included security assurances that they had committed a Trump in Singapore, as well as changes in the direction of normalization of the relationship with Washington.
Students in Harvard are taking a class on how to get enough rest
A new school at Harvard University this year teaches participants how to sleep more, in an effort to fight a growing, high culture of learning by staying awake all night with caffeine.
A study found that students at University No. One in the world often have no idea how to deal with the basic principles of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kessler, professor of sleep sciences at Harvard Medical School and expert at the Brigham and Williams Hospital, planned the course, whose assessment was the first to be conducted in the United States.
He was inspired to open the course after a lecture about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the talk, one girl came up to me and said, "Why are they just telling me that now, in my last year of school?"
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep--what surprised me," he told the telescope.
The course, which was passed for the first time in the year, explains to students the principles of how good sleeping habits help to accomplish academic and athletic functions and improve their overall condition.
Paul Breira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and senior director of the University Health Services, said that the university had decided to open the course after finding out that students had suffered a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The course of an hour includes a series of interactive missions.
One part shows a picture of a room in the dorms, where students press coffee bars, curtains, sports clothes and books -- to get explanations about the effects of caffeine and light and how to perform sleep-distorting athletics, as well as about the importance of a sleeping routine.
In other cases, sharing in sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Thereafter, a map of the campus, if interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know it won't change the behavior of the students between night and night.
But we believe they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know the effects of choice to smoke cigarettes, add Professor Zizler.
According to the culture of pride over sleepless nights, modern technology and increasing pressure on students make the sleep shortage growing.
There should be every student's secret weapon to fight stress, anxiety and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation can lead the brain to hunger, so we're hungry all the time.
Raymond Sue, a 19-year-old student from California who was studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Zizler design the course, after taking part in one of his first-year classes in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and moved him to encourage a course to the entire campus.
The next step, so he hopes, will be to ask all students for advanced descriptions to complete a similar program before joining the competition institution.
Professor Cybele recommended students to check the possibility of directing a clock that would ring when it was time to go to bed, not just the hour when it had to wake up, and to be awake to the harmful effects of a blue light that would agree on electronics and LED light, which could break the ceramic rate and thus cause problems in falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangs: A gate of Manga is known to Gard's players.
Herring sped up another attack of losing the game except when Dolly Manga caused Steven Gard's rebel players to defeat 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibroks were hoping to win their first win in the game except since the win of February 1-4 in St. John'ston, but Gary Holt's group only lost Gerard's second in 18 games and left the group at eight points after the famous Harts team at the head of the Scotland High Party.
A mob attacked seven minutes before half the time, and it didn't seem that Herring's uninspiring players would be right.
While Herring's now down to sixth place, Livingston climbs up to third place and immediately after the Hibernian across a gate.
And you may be waiting for another Rangers debel after the Coun Colum Spence needed to be treated for head injury after you wanted to probably throw him off the offer.
Jared valued eight trips in a group that passed over the air to half the final in the Tatpar cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went up with the 11 Livingston players who took a spot from Harts last week, and he could have been willing to play with the players at any time.
Herring's may have ruled the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball he had in their hands.
They almost took the second minute when Manga sent a bullet to Scott Patman who kicked into Alan McGergor's gate, but a middle- field player kicked the ball too far.
Then a deep, free kick of Kegan Jacob found Captain Craig Alekt, but his shield Alan to Guy could only kick out of the ring.
Herring's did take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last three.
Alfredo Morlos certainly thought that he should have been guilty after a quarter of a game time, when he and Steven Wills were in trouble, but Judge Steven T.
Herring's only managed to kick twice to the gate in the first half, but the Ibrox Liam Kelly easily destroyed the touch of Sana colabali and the weak kick of Obi Ajaria.
While Livingston's opening in the 34th minute was opposed to the way the game was conducted, no one will deny that they would at least deserve this for their hard work.
Herring's again failed to deal with Jacobs' deep free ball.
Scott Artfield didn't respond while Deckleen Gallagher moved the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept a cold when moving to Manga to a simple finish.
Jarard did a half-time job when he replaced Colivally with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had an immediate effect when the extreme/uncle wing ball to Morlos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to force the host group to play the exact kind of game he liked, as Guy and Lect continued to send long bullets.
Holt's team was able to increase the delivery in the other stages, but McGregor was well placed to prevent Jacobs' attempt before a protest from the corner.
Herring's replacement player Glenn Middleton was next claiming another felony in front of Jacobs, but Thompson was ignored again.
You are the one who invents Mona Jagger.
And now stand up to your Lord of Sunday Morning: September 30th, 1882, today 136 years ago, and continue... the day when the future Physicist Johannes Willem was born in Germany.
Gary has developed a method that allows for identification and radioactivity, a finding that eventually led to a device known as Mona Giger.
Since it became a science-based device, but in 1950 it has also become a pop culture-based stand-up thanks to the film "Bels of Coronado," in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans became two strange mornings/scientific scientists:
Man: "What the hell is this thing?"
Roger's: "It's Mona Giger, which is used to track radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put the headphones together, you can really hear the effects of radioactivity on the atoms in the minerals."
Evans: "Oh, my God, it's really a bomb now!"
Hans Giger went to his world in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that carried his name continues to live after him.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see cancer cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see cancer cells and destroy them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells as part of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, and the conversion of cells in the lab.
Then the cells can "see" milk shared by many cancers and then they're freaking back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
In one woman who has been treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells, cancer cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes the rescue of the patient's immune cells, the conversion of cells in the lab so that they can “see” a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers, and then the injection of the cells back to the patient.
Professor J'I Brascsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Batsada, Maryland, said, "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "Moves the development of a number of cancers", including cancer of the demon, the spinal cord, vision, and the gastrointestinal tract, explains Professor Brascsky.
A similar approach to taking patients' vaccines and teaching them how to attack cancer cells managed to treat the type of blood cancer.
Kenya West broke out in a speech supporting the tramp, where he had a MAGA hat in his head, after being shown in SNL.
It wasn't taken in a nice eye.
Kenya West responded with boz health at the studio during a confused show on the Starday Night Way show, praising United States President Donald Trump and saying he was running for president in 2020.
After performing his third song on the show, called the "Gossse Town" in the performance of the MacAmerica Great hat, he blew up with a statement of proof against the democracies and returned his support in the tramp.
"So many times I talk to white people who say, "How can you love Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd leave America a long time ago," he said.
SNL's episode began with a back-up demonstration of Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star praised Bert Kwano's testimony to the Senate's Legal Committee, as regards charges of sexual assault by Christine Blazy Ford.
Although there's no evidence on the program, the thing was uploaded to social networks by the comedy Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to roll West in the commercials.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was getting a review behind the scenes on the hat he was wearing.
They attacked me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out to the stage with that hat on your head."
They attacked me!
And then they said I was in a dark place," he said, according to the Washington Express.
West continued, "You want to see the dark place?" saying he's putting my Superman hat on, 'cause that means no one can tell me what to do.
Try to show love."
His speech was at least twice as good as that of the audience, and it seemed to have been a embarrassed SNL team member, Variety Report, and one of them said to the paper, "Shut up the tammy fell all over the studio."
West's on the show as a last-minute replacement instead of the singer Ryan Granda, who was her ex-partner, Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
The many West when he made the song I love it when he's dressed as a Perier bottle.
West won backup from the captain of the SPUSA conservative team, Kends Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "For one of the most brave souls: thank you for not giving in to the crowd."
But submitting an Actualism Hunter's Foundation wrote on Twitter West just said, "Be who he is and it's totally wonderful."
But I have chosen not to reward (by acquiring music or his union or supporting his art) that I think of striving and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we, she's added.
Before the program, Harper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that now he was "the woman who was once known as the Buy West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Didy's, who is also known as Paf Dedi, Papi and P Didy.
Another rapper, Snoop Doc, held the name Snoop Lyon, and of course the well-known musician Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist who had previously been known as Kryrins.
A murder charge for stabbing a restaurant in Blaft
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in the east at Blpsett on Friday.
According to the police incident, it happened in Bilia to guard.
The suspect is expected to appear before the Bellpsett court on Monday.
The charges will be checked by the Public Prosecution Service.
The show star, the throne games, Keith Herrington, attacks the toxic mania.
Kit Reinton is known for the role of the "Silver of the Stars of the Imminently Immaculate Phantom. "
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the superhero's stereotype, saying that such jobs on the screen often convey the message to young children that they must be tough to respect.
In an interview with Sonday Times Culture, Keith said he thought that something went wrong and wondered how to deal with the problem of poisonous males in the age of #MeToo.
Keith, who recently married another star in the throne games, Rose Leslie, who too was 31, admitted that he was very upset about taking care of her kind.
"A woman I feel very troubled right now -- where did we make a mistake on the way about masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men in their growing time, from the point of view of the problem we're witnessing to?"
Keith thinks that TV may be partly responsible for the rise of poisonous men, because of the very male characters she presents.
He continued: “What come from inside, and what learnt from outside?
What are we gonna learn from TV and the street that makes young kids feel like they have to be on this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time -- how do you change that?
'Cause there's no doubt that something went wrong for young men."
In an interview, he admitted that he would not participate in any series of continuations or derivatives of the throne games after the end of the next summer series, stating that he had “ended with battle fields and horses”.
From November Keith will be buried in a new version of Sam Sheppard West's play, which tells the story of a film producer and his stolen brother.
The player recently found out that he saw his wife Rose as the best thing that had happened as a result of the throne games.
"I knew my wife on the show, so this way she gave me my future family, and my life from that moment forward," he said.
Rose played the role of Yigrat, the love subject of Jon Snow, the fantasy show wins the Emmy Prize.
The other two were married in June 2018 in the Szali family yard in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% rise in new cases
China has announced 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are sick of the disease, thus giving official health factors.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
The great majority of new cases were infected as a result of sexual existence, which is a change to the past.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in certain parts of China as a result of infected blood vessels.
But the number of people infected with HIV this way reduced to almost zero, according to official health factors in China at a conference in Yonan County.
Yet, year by year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China rose by 100,000.
HIV infections resulting from sexual existence are a burning problem in the Chinese H.H.A. community.
Homosexuality ceased to be against the law in China in 1997, but it was said that the invasion against the U.S. people was widespread.
Because of the state's conservative values, research has estimated that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of infection are the result of a lack of adequate protective measures in relation to these species.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a man from her team leaked information about Republican Senators and protected "the dangerous lies" and "the Conspiracy theories"
The American Senator Maxine Waters rejected the charges on Saturday that a member of her team had published personal information about three American senators on the Senator's Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic Senator from Los Angeles estimated that the charges were spread by Internet sites and visitors to extreme right-hand visitors.
"Falses, lies, and other detestable lies," said Waters on Twitter.
According to the reports, the information that was published included the address of the residences and telephone numbers of the American Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both of whom were dead.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, and was published by an unknown person at the Capitol Hill during the hearing before the Senate Committee about charges of inappropriate sexual conduct against the Supreme Court judge, Bert Kwano.
The leak took place some time after the three senators asked Kwano.
A conservative website, such as Gateway Fundit and Redstate, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was linked to Waters' office and published information on a member of the Waters team, according to the Hill report.
"This baseless accusation is totally wrong and a complete lie", adds Waters.
"My team member -- his identity and personal details revealed and his safety was affected by these false charges and mistakes -- was not in any way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This baseless accusation is totally wrong and a complete lie."
The announcement of Waters was quick to review the Internet, including by the former White House Press Secretary Ari Flyser.
"It's an angry denial," wrote Feliser.
“The thing indicates that she does not have the weather required of Congressmen.
When someone's charged with something he didn't do, he can't react with anger.
He can't react.
He can't doubt the motives of the accused.
He has to be calm and calm."
It seemed that Fleicher was comparing Waters' response to the democratic review of Judge Kavanau, who accused visitors who seemed too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Ummar Navaro, a Republican candidate who is trying to defeat Waters in the middle of the priesthood, has also raised his thoughts on Twitter.
Great if it's true, he wrote on Twitter.
In her announcement, Waters said that her remains turned to the appropriate authorities and to law enforcement regarding these false claims.
"We'll make sure the sinners are found." It's continued, and they'll be sued for all their destructive and dangerous actions against my team members."
A review of the film.
It is now acceptable to look for meanings about Burkzeit in any new film with a British perspective, and it does seem to fit in with this resurrection of the Uni English Code of Action, which began somewhere in 2003 with Johnny English and woke up back in 2011 with Johnny English coming back.
Is an ironic self-strip on how much we're not worth anything going to become our country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the glamour-eyed and rubber-eyed Johnny Ingleish has another chance of breaking things down -- and his name is more than any other mass-based piece of work designed to watch movies in countries that are not English-speaking.
He's, of course, the stupid English agent, who, despite his weird face attitude to a slick light, seems a little like a clauzo, a little master between him and a lot of this guy who contributed a single gift to the beauty of the fire trucks in the opening text of the Olympics in London in 2012.
It is also originally based on the mysterious international passenger Atkinson's age in the forgotten TV ads for the Barclaycard, allowing chaos behind him.
There's one minute or two nice in Johnny Inglesch's last edition.
I liked the part where Johnny Ingleish approached the helicopter when he was wearing a medieval armored dress, and my pressing heart was ringing for moments on his helmet.
Atkinson exhibits his comedy physical abilities, but humor feels rather weak and strangely unnecessary, especially since the "high" kind of spy movies like 007 and an impossible mission themselves now include a cosmopolitan.
The humor feels like he's turned to kids instead of adults, and as I've had the crazy adventures of Johnny Ingleish, they're less brilliant and focused on the jokes of Atkinson's horror film like Mr. Ben's.
The theater begins when a major danger threatens Britain.
Computers hacked into the British spy's super-secret Internet network, revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, threatened by the chief agent -- unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for a government in a proud and battlelike form, who is already suffering from a total collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson does her best to fill the role as Teresa May, but she has little to do with what she does from the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is exposed, she'll have to bring someone back from the strike.
And it says that 'Ni Ingleish Herbian herself, now employed as a school manager in a prestigious institution, but gives informal lessons in how to be a hidden spy: some good jokes here, when England offers a school-style college to roll.'
Ingleish is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and united with his ex-associate in the buff he suffered again, which he is again playing Ben Miller.
Beuf is now the man married to the substation officer, in the role of an angry class queen who has a bit of fried Vico Frederin.
So, Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's secret service income for a terrible mix are returning to action, when Pam-Pathal is beautiful in the form of an oblivion bulbuta, the same dresse of Olega Corlenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is falling down to me dangerously under the magic of mil-arderr critical technology claiming to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain - the evil Jason Walta at the age of Jake Lacey.
Ingleish and Buff start their meditation that she is more than a band of two clowns: under the cover of waiters, they pick up on the fire of a fancy French restaurant; they create an Andrmosia when they smuggle themselves into the awesome yacht of Walta; and anglic from the absolute antelope of his attempt to use a similar reality assessment to learn the inner structure of Walta's house.
No doubt all efforts have been made to lead to the last phase, but despite the warmth and kindness of children, it has a sense of television for children.
A pretty medium level.
Like the other Johnny Ingleish movies, I couldn't help but think: Can the British movie industry not give Rwan Atkinson a role that really does justice with his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it's making a plan for the British to work four days a week but get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is considering a structural plan for the British to work four days a week -- but they'll get paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants company managers to pass the savings as a result of the artificial shift of understanding (AI) to workers in another day of rest.
I mean, the employees will have a three-day weekend, and they'll still get the same wage.
Sources said the idea would be for the company's economic agenda and plans to shift the country to the benefit of the employees.
The Congress of the Professional Unions supports the move for a four-day work week as a way that employees can enjoy the changes in their economy.
A senior source at the Leaburg Party said to Sandy Times: “Policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It's not going to happen overnight, but this four-day work week is where the party's approach to re-fooding the economy for the benefit of the employees, as well as to the Party's overall industrial strategy."
The Leiburg Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party called for a four-day week of work during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the ambition has not been supported right now by the Leaburg Party as a whole.
The Leaburg Party's spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not a policy of the Party and the Party does not consider it."
Leabur's candidate for the treasurer, John McDonnel, used the party meeting last week to cast his vision for a socialistic revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnel said he was determined to win back power from "unsolved managers" and "pricers" in service companies.
The candidate for the treasurer's plans also comes from the fact that the current owners of water companies may not be able to get their entire investment back because the Liberian government may do less on the basis of the discovery of inappropriate conduct.
It also confirms that there are plans to bring employees to the board of directors of companies and to create full-fledged rents to transfer 10% of the capital of companies in the private labour sector, to enter into a two-year divindens drug of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told the TV show '60 minutes' if the FBI's investigation of us is going to change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Bert Kwano delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court at least a week, raising the question whether the investigators could convince the Republicans to withdraw their support.
On the idea of Sunday on the 60-minute program, Scott Fly asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their mind.
It looks like Kennedy was more open than his party colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said to the hearing, I said I talked to Judge Kwano.
I called him after it happened, the charge went up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was my decision, determined, perfunctory."
On the other hand, it seems that Graham's vote is in possession of a rock.
"I've already decided about Bert Kwano and there'll be a need for a blow-out charge," he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Bert firmly denied it, added Graham, referring to Christine Blazy Ford.
And no man she mentioned could prove it.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see how anything can change."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and did he give anything to reduce poverty?
Saturday New York described the World Citizens' Festival, an annual music event with the most impressive list of stars that will appear and an equally impressive goal of an end to the world's poverty.
The World Citizens' Festival, which exists this seventh time, will bring to it tens of thousands of people who have been involved in a major law study in Central Park not only to enjoy such performances as the St. Jackson, Cardi Bi and Sean Engineer, but also to increase awareness of the real purpose of the event - to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 World Citizens' Festival is the continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to put an end to poverty by raising the number of people who actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP card), the concert island must complete a series of assignments, or "acts" such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, calling or other significant ways to help raise awareness for the purpose of ending poverty.
But how successful was the festival when it was only 12 years before it was to accomplish its purpose?
Is the idea of giving a free ticket to people to this concert really a way to convince them to need a call for action, or is it another case of "clickivism" -- people who feel that they really are affecting by signing a huge web page or sending a Twitter view?
Since 2011, the World Citizens' Organization has stated that more than 19 million "actions" have been used in support of it, pressing on a variety of different goals.
According to these actions, world leaders have been helping to announce commitments and policies that are worth over $37 billion that will affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group noted 390 commitments and pledges as a result of its operations, of which at least $10 billion had already started with distribution or fundraising.
The group appreciates that so far the funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the core commitments include The Power of Nutrition, British partners of investors and fellow workers, “to help children grow up to their potential”, and promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help put an end to the country's nutrition, after you received more than 4,700 calls from the Twitter from the “World Citizens”.
With support from the British government, donors, national governments and 'world citizens' as you do, we can make social justice on the subject of sub-principal criticism in history, saying that the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Tracy Ollman to the audience during the London live concert in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 operations had been carried out that called for Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government had announced the pace of the project, Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children with dietary interference.
In response to one of the common questions on their Internet site, "What makes you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
The citizens of the world responded: "It will be a long and difficult course -- sometimes it will fall and fail.
But, like the great movements ahead of us of civil rights and resistance to Parthead, we'll succeed, because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mends, Cardy Bee and Jannell Mona are among some of the events that took place this year in New York City, where they served as a bee-li-forns and au-kman.
The U.S. can use the Navy for the "sealock" to delay the Russian energy export -- the Face Secretary.
"In due course", Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, discovered the American facial minister Ryan Zink, as quoted in the Washington Express.
Zinc claimed that the Russian involvement in Syria -- which you have done, it's important to mention, at the government's legal order -- is going to run to spread new energy horizons.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to use energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern abdomen of Europe," he said, according to the report.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States is capable, with our fleet, of making sure that the sea basins are open and at the time they need to lay siege to make sure their energy sources are not in the market," he said.
Zinky turned his words to the parties at an event that left Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group defining itself as "a voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued his comments and compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, stating that they were indeed identical.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, a mind-set and a replacement of fuels”, he said, referring to Russia as a "pon of one trick" because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at the time the Trump government was on mission to increase its damaged natural gas export to Europe, replacing Russian energy sources, which are much cheaper for European consumers.
To that end, Trump's government officials, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to cancel its participation in the "incompetent" pipeline project, which, according to Trump's words, turned Berlin into Moscow's "shoe".
Moscow has repeatedly submitted that the pipeline project is down to $21 billion and that it's supposed to double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion, which is only an economic project.
The Kremlin contends that Washington's unnecessary objection to the project is preventing only economic reasons and an unfair example of competition.
I believe we're partners in the opinion that energy can't be a pressure-driven tool and that consumers should be able to select suppliers, said the Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting in Moscow with the Secretary for Energy Affairs of the United States, Rick Perry, in September.
The U.S. position won a reaction against a strike from Germany, which reconfirmed its commitment to the project.
BDI, the leading organization of the German industrial sector, called on the United States to keep away from the energy policy of the European Union and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a major problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Campef, head of the German Industry Organization (BDI) following a recent meeting between the German chancella Markel and Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, seriously considering the running for the presidency in 2020, said the Senator from Mostes.
The Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she "considered seriously" the option of running for the president after the mid-community election.
Warren confirmed her intention to run for the presidency during a meeting in the Hollywood City of Wests.
"It's time for women to get to Washington to fix our broken government, and for that, there's a need for a woman to head," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider the race for Presidentship."
Warren expressed her opinion on President Donald Trump during the city meeting, saying that he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
I'm so worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, she said.
Warren visited Trump about Bert Kwano's appointment as a judge in the Supreme Court.
"Course, we need the FBI's pre-voting investigation."
However, a survey published on Warren's most choice was not of the opinion that she should run for the 2020 election.
Fifty-eight percent of the "potential" polls at the Posts said that the Senator should not run for election, according to a survey of the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffoc and the newspaper Boston Glov".
Thirty-two percent supported the intention of dealing with the senator's presidency.
The survey showed that there was a greater support for former Governor Daval Patrick's run, with 38% who supported his run against 48% who opposed her.
Imposed figures from the fat Democratic Party in connection with possible confrontations for the 2020 elections include former Vice-President G'W Beiden and Senator Mormont Bernie Sanders.
Beiden said he'd make an official decision in January, according to A.P.A. reports.
Sarah Peylin refers to the post-trac-Pellin post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's arrest.
Tarak Peylin was 26 years old in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on a day at night.
"What's going on on on my son, what's on him since he's been back, allows me to identify with families who have experienced the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries that we're bringing back," she told the co-locating audience in the town of Tolsa, Oklahoma.
Peylin called her "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other demobilized soldiers, "they're returning a little different, they're going back hard, they're coming back and wondering if what we've given to the country to their friends and the airmen, and all the other military personnel, is being honored."
He was arrested on the day in the town of Wessela in Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, arresting the report of the domestic violence and holding a gun under the lease, according to Dan Bennet's report, the Wessilla Police Department.
18 countries and district of Colombia supporting the challenge of the new state asylum policy
Eighteen countries and Columbia County support a legal challenge to the new United States policy refusing to provide shelter to victims who escape situations where gang violence or domestic violence are involved.
Representatives from the 18 countries and the district filled out a statement from the court friend of the day in Washington to support the challenge of asylum seekers' policy, according to the NBC report.
The full name of the complainant in Grace v. Schens, who filed the August U.S. Civil Rights Union, was undiscovered.
She said that her partner, his violent sons, had been abused by gang members, but official factors in the U.S. government rejected her request for asylum on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace's State Congress described countries to Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, of which a number of requests were made to state asylum in the United States, as nations dealing with many problems in all matters concerning gangs and family violence.
The new U.S. state asylum policy repealed a decision from 2014 of the BIA Immigration Council that allows immigrants without evidence of escape from situations of domestic violence to apply for a national asylum.
The Attorney General of Columbia County, Carl Resin, said in a day-to-day statement that the new policy “is ignoring the decades of state law, federal and international law”.
“The federal law requires that all discussions about the state asylum requests rely on the facts and the specific circumstances of the request, and the new policy barrier violates this principle,” stated in a statement by the court friend.
The lawyers also claimed that the policy, which prevents the entry of immigrants, affects the economy of the United States, because they tend to become entrepreneurs and "provide needed work" to them.
Attorney General G. Schensen ordered immigration judges not to give more State asylum to victims who escaped from domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"The state shelter is open to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of ethnic, religious, national or social group members or political opinion", Schens said in the press about the policy he delivered on June 11.
The purpose of the state shelter would never have been to ease any problems -- not even any serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Pallo, while the killing is multiplied, in the race to find survivors.
For survivors, the situation has become more difficult than just a moment.
"There's a very tense feeling," said Risa Cosma, 35, and if a baby gets cut off from a heat at the Lampon Center in the ruined town of Pallo.
Every moment the ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is rare."
The residents appeared to be returning to their ruined homes, living among spores of water, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and in hospitals, who were caught from the 7.5 earthquake, were flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Dewey Harris, who suffered fractures in the back and shoulder, lay outside Palo's military hospital, where they were treated for severe earthquakes that occurred after the earthquake.
Tears filled his eyes as he told how he felt the terrible earthquake alarmed the hotel room on the fifth floor of the hall that was part of his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," said Harris to the A.P.A., adding that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, and then she was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're in a safe place."
The U.S. Ambassador blames China for "insurgents" with propaganda ads.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advert in the U.S.A., while aggressively promoting trade advantages between the United States of America and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump, referring to the last day of adding to the payment of the Chinese newspaper 'Cinna Daily', at Dae Moe Ragster, the most widely sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of attempting to interfere with the U.S. Congress on November 6, he claimed that China had rejected it.
The charge of Trump's China was trying to interfere with the U.S. election, marked by a new phase, according to official sources in the United States, on the Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
Although naturalized foreign governments will be made aware of the promotion of trade, Big'ing and Washington are now trapped in the Gawa Trade War, where every country is up and equals the customs rate on its imported products.
The Mars, which was launched as early as the trade war, was intended to cause harm to the U.S. states, such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, said American and Chinese experts.
Terry Bernstad, Ambassador to the United States of America in China, former governor of Iowa for many years, and an important source of agricultural goods to China, said that Big's hurt employees, farmers and American businesses.
China, writes Bernstad in an opinion on Day A of De Wayne Register, "encouraging the acts of bullying by publicizing awareness in our free press".
By breaking up her propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's tradition of free speech and precious journalism, and has published a payment notice in de Monne Register.
And against each other, at the Bijing Street Presse, you'll find a few voices and don't see any real reflections of the different ideas that the Chinese people may have on the disturbing economic path, considering that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has avoided the offer to publish," he said, although it was not mentioned in some paper.
The Republican Party moves women's voices before the mid-secondary elections with the Kavano incident, alarming analysts.
While many of the Republican party leaders are on the side of the candidate for the Supreme Court, Bert Kwano, protecting him against the number of charges of sexual assault, analysts warned that they would see an adverse reaction, especially from women, during the next mid-election elections.
The feelings surrounding the matter were particularly alive, and most Republicans officially protested their desire to move forward in the voting process.
"This kind of stuff cannot be returned back," said Grant Rihrer, a member of state science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Rahre said he doubted that the recent efforts of Senator Jeff Flick to open up the FBI's investigation would be sufficient for an angry vote.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday -- they're not going to forget it tomorrow or November," said on the day and "Carin Z'N-Pierre, Senior and National Councillor of MoveOn, according to the newspaper Washington, D.C.".
In the mornings, protestors called "Nubber's Coming" when we showed up in the Senate hall, while Republicans in control of the Senate's Judicial Committee chose to continue to promote the appointment of Kowanu, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, according to a report from the Mayic website.
The "democratic enthusiasm and motivations will break new features", said Stu Rotenberg News, a political analyst who is not party to it.
People say they were already tall; they're right.
But they can be higher, especially among women's brightest voices and among young voters, between ages 18 and 29, who, despite their lack of affection for the president, are often prevented from voting."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which dismissed the charges regarding the sexual assault of the candidate to the High Court, the analysts argued that there were two responses against whether the Republicans would continue to promote the approval of the appointment.
"The appointment caused the Republicans to become a serious mess," said Michael Steele, chairman of the former Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, the NBC News Channel Report.
“It is not just the vote of the committee or the final vote or whether Kowanu receives the appointment, but also the way the Republicans have dealt with it and in the way they have treated it”, he referred to the new channel G. Sicill, Director of Priorities, USA, which is a group that is assisting in the selection of democratics.
Yet, it seems that Americans are somewhat rigid about the degree of their faith in the terms of Ford and Kowanu's responsibilities, with a slightly higher support at Ford.
A final poll of Yougov, shows that 41 percent of the respondents believed in either sure or likely for Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed in certain or likely for us.
In addition, 38% said they thought that Koano was lying for sure or likely during his testimony, while only 30% said it about Ford.
After pressurised by Felix, the FBI is currently investigating the charges raised by Ford and also the charges raised by at least one other complainer, Deborah Remirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford's weekly testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee last week that Koano attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court exposed Aber Mino to her during a party they attended at Yale University in the '80s.
Developer of the global global Internet system is planning to start a new Internet network to build on Google and Facebook
Tim Bernards Lee, inventer of the global global Internet network, mending Start-F to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of the man who became a legend in the world of technology, is a company that opens up Solid, the open code platform of Berners Lee.
Solid platform allows users to choose where to store their data and who the people who can access the different types of data.
In an exclusive interview to the Fast Company, Bernards Lee joked that it meant "world control" behind Inrupt.
"We have to do it now," he said about the Start-up.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create a personal online database or POD.
The index can include contact lists, lists of performance actions, timetables, music library and other personal and professional tools.
Imagine that Google Deriv, Microsoft Autolock, Salack and Supotifi will be available in one hand, at the same time.
What unites the personal database is that only the user will decide who can access the information and what kind of information can access it.
The company calls it "personal power through data".
According to John Bruce, the director of the company, it means that the Inrupt will find the resources, processes and capabilities that are suitable to assist in reaching Solid for all.
Today, the company includes Bernards Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of key staff hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer code software.
Starting with the week, technology developers around the world can create affordable apps using the available tools on the Inrupt website.
Burners Lee said that he and his team were not discussing Facebook and Google about their agreement or refusing to make a complete change, which would make a complete reverse and by night all their business models.
"We're not asking for permission."
On a post published on the Saturday's medium, Bernards Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and a environmental system to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Web built in the Solid.
In 1994, Bernards Lee changed the face of the Internet when he set up the network's correct organization, W3C at the Technology Institute of the West.
In the last few months, Bernards Lee had a voice that had an effect on the network neutralization debate.
Even during the silence of Inrupt, Bernards Lee will continue to be the founder and manager of the W3C organization, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
I'm particularly optimistic about the next century of the network, adding Bernards Lee.
Bernard Van: An event marked by a religious man who won Victoria's cross during World War I
The only man of the British Church who won the cross of Victoria during World War I was named 100 years after his birth.
Colonel and Reverend Bernard Van won the Victoria Cross on September 29, 1918, for his participation in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had won the highest British degree.
The stone of eternity was exposed by both of his grandsons, on a march that was held in the Jordan, in the province of Northampton, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that exposure to the stone was exactly 100 after his grandfather won the honor of being a "symbolic super. "
According to the London Gazett newspaper, on September 29, 1918, the deputy champion Van led his battalion and crossed the San Canton Cave Road through heavy fog and heavy fire ass from field guns and I got a gun.
Then he set off the line of fire and led the line forward before we hurryed to take one hand over the bottom of the bomb and dropped three of the falcon.
Deputy Captain Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, one month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72 years old, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never compare to, but something that makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also assumed a stranger after the march, which led the Royal Brentwood Youth Orchestra.
Michael Van said that he was "respecting to take part in the parade" and added "the greatness of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given to many people".
Communicating combat art fans stayed up all night to watch the 206, and instead they got Peig.
Imagine you've been awake all night to watch for Baltor 206's stubbornness and, eventually, to watch a major event that's taken away from you.
The plan contains 13 contracts, including six on the main card, and a live broadcast during the night on British Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Jared Musasey and Rory McDonald were preparing for the battle, British viewers remained shocked when the coverage changed to poppes.
Some of them were not impressed by the change after they stayed awake until the early morning hours, especially to watch the battle.
One fan on Twitter described the transition to a movie that was painted for children as "a kind of sick joke."
"It's a government establishment that at 6:00 a.m. the original content was not suitable, so they had to go through the children's programs", says Dave Schwartz, a senior vice president for marketing and communication in Baltour, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig, yeah."
The president of the Blutor Company, Scott Coker, said they were going to work on their schedule to include the British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the retransmission, I think we can solve it by the end," said Coker.
But the hour is six a.m. over there and we can't solve the problem until "A" in our time zone, i.e. on their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, in the time of the transition, a lot of text messages were exchanged between the parties and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix this. We thought it was a technical problem.
But no, it was a government problem.
I can assure you, next time it's not going to happen.
We only clean five fights instead of six -- as we usually do -- we tried to give the fans more and more.
It's a matter of unlucky."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt inferior because of his sexual tendency
Tom Daily, the Olympic jump into the water, said that in his youth he felt inferior to all others because of his sexual tendency -- but that feeling gave him the motivation to make a success.
The 24-year-old jumper said he didn't know until he got to the middle school that "not everyone like me."
In an interview given on the Desert Island Discs of the Radio Channel 4, at Lauren Lawren's directive, he said that he was expressing the rights of homosexuals to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympic games.
The usual host of the old show, Christy Young, went on a few months' sick leave.
In his appearance as Lauren's first plan star, Dili said that he felt that the others were growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, the feeling of inferiority, and the different feeling, were true things that gave me power and power and allowed me to succeed."
He wanted to prove he was something, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out what his sexual inclination was.
The man who won twice the Olympic Hardy has become a successful leader of the U.S. Community campaign and has used his participation in the American League's games in Australia this year to read other countries to give them legal status as homosexuals.
He openly expressed himself on the matter because he felt lucky that he had been given the opportunity to live freely and without consequences and wanted to give “hope ” to others.
The Triangle Winner of the World Cup said that falling in love with a man is creating American film, Dustin Lance Black, which he met in 2013, "stripped me with surprise."
Daily married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than him last year, but he said that the giant hair would never be a problem.
He said it was hard to find someone his age who grew up and went down in the Olympic Games for the first time when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple became the parents of June, a boy named Robert Ray Black Daily, and Daily said that his "every point of view" had changed.
If you'd asked me last year, it's all around me I need to win the gold medal, he said.
You know what, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
Our son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being tested as a cancerous brain tumor.
Daily said his father didn't accept the fact that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked whether they already had tickets to the 2012 Olympic Games - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be here to be first line dad," he said.
"I held his hand while he was breathing and only when he stopped breathing really and died, finally knowing that he wasn't unsuccessful," he said.
A year later, Daily chose the 2012 Olympic Games and won the Red medal.
"I just knew that this was what I'd dreamed of all my life-- to dive in front of a home audience in the Olympic games, it didn't feel any better," he said.
It's also what inspired him to choose his first song -- the Proud of The 'R' Small -- who identified him during the Olympic Games and still makes him a duck.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Day 4 at 11:15 a.m., according to the British Summer clock.
Michaelson was disappointed at the performance and went down to the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
The American golf player Phil Michaelson will set a record on a day when he plays for the 47th time at the Ryder Cup, but he'll have to upgrade the performance so that the event won't turn into a miserable way.
Michaelson, who attended the 12th anniversary and found a record, went down to the bench according to Jim Pyurrick's decision during the football games and the two football games on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as they were at the games with the United States team, Michaelson, who won five times in the Major's tournament, spent half the day encouraging and half the other half working on his game in the corner in hope of fixing the sick evil he suffered.
So, 48-year-old Michaelson is not an ideal choice for the long law routes are usually not excuseable for errors.
And if the competition itself isn't cool enough, Michaelson, at the ninth game on Day A, the protest against the exact British champion, Francesco Molinari, who cooperated with the start-up player Tommy Platwood and won all four of their games this week.
If American ambition, which lost four points in the beginning of 12 single games, were to succeed in the first stages, Michaelson's game could have been a success.
Fiorrick expressed confidence in his actor, though we didn't expect him to say anything else.
"He fully understood his job today, put it on my back, put his arm around me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Fiorrick.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's a member of the Hall of Glory and he's added a lot to these teams before, and the week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's how it developed, and that's how we thought we should continue.
He wanted to be on track, just like all the other players."
Michaelson will break Nick Paldo's record with the highest number of games in the Ryder Cup on day A.
This may end his career at the Ryder Cup, which never really matched his personal peaks.
Michaelson's winnings are 18 wins, 20 losses and seven skirts, although Fiorrick said his presence added certain intangible advantages to the team.
"He's funny, sercist, shy, he likes to make fun of people, and it's fun to be with him in the dressing room," he explained.
I think the younger players also enjoyed having fun with him this week, and it was nice to see that.
There's a lot beyond the game itself."
The European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great advantage can be gone soon.
Thomas Bjorn, the European Captain, knows from an attempt to make a significant contribution before last day in the only Rider Cup games that can change for the worse.
The Danish player started his game at Waldrama in 1997, when he was his partner in the game, Grandpa Belstros, there was a five-point advantage on the Americans, which he lost almost half the finish line with a minor advantage and won 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"I continue to remind myself that we had a great advantage in Walderama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Waldrama where we won but with a small advantage," said Bjorn, after watching victory 5-3, in the 2018 tournament, and "and these yesterday, which led to Leron 10-6 Bla Gulf National.
So history will prove to me and to everyone on the team that it's not over.
We have to give it all up tomorrow.
We need to get on track and do all the right things.
It's not over until the condoms don't show up on the board.
We have a purpose to try to win the Cup, and we need to focus on it.
I said all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of those who're standing in front of us on the other side -- the best players in the world."
Bjorn was happy to be playing his players on the hard track and added: "I think I don't have to make the most of the late in all the golf.
Tomorrow can be completely different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on personal performance, which is completely different.
It's a pleasure to be on track when everything goes well, but when you're out there alone, so your full ability as a golf player is tested.
And that's the message that needs to be conveyed to the players: you have to make the best of yourselves tomorrow.
Now, you leave the couple behind and he needs to make the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, the captain of rival team Jim Pyurrick will expect to perform better personal performances than his players, compared to their performance at couples' games, except Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Fiorrick himself knows the winning side and they're the losing side, during the important final days of this kind of tournament, after he took part in the winning team in Brooklyn before losing, when you were a European team that won a miracle in the finish game, as planned in the movie "Miracles at Medinah".
"I remember every word and word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Carnshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players towards the last day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but I want to succeed in the first stages, as you've seen in Brooklyn, and as you've seen in Medinah.
When this momentum goes to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We prepare our composition accordingly and lift the guys up to course according to the feeling we have, you know, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight, and he'll face Rory McLeroy at the top game, with Paul Cassie, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Platwood and Ian Polter, who are the rest of the Europeans at the top half.
"I chose the team of players all right because I think he'll be able to bring us to the end," said Bjorn when he referred to his only choice.
The arrival of Germany's new warship has been rejected once more.
Germany's new fleet charter was due in 2014 to replace the old warships from the cold war era, but it was rejected at least a year, due to an inflexible rise system, reported local media.
The receipt of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the leading ship at the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-clas, has now been rejected until the first half of 2019, according to a report by the newspaper di typified a military speaker.
The cruise vessel was supposed to be joining the Navy in 2014, but disturbing issues after the supply ended up on the Japanese project.
All four of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-Class, which was ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-Class frigates.
It is expected that they could have had a powerful cannon, anti-missile and anti-ship missile batteries, as well as fraudulent technologies, such as aquatic signatures, low-end and radar signatures.
Other important features, including longer maintenance periods, could be to destroy the new most important items for up to two years away from home.
However, the meaning of repeated delays is that the new ships -- which are supposed to allow Germany to send troops across the sea -- will become obsolete until the moment you enter the service -- indicate a di typology.
The F125 Basket Project came to the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Vos in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship and built ships after its delivery.
Not much is known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media quoted a number of critical software and heating that made the warship useless for use in a battle mission.
The software leases were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-Class Navy brains would be activated by about 120 sailors - as half of the team used in the older Prefectures, the Bremen Class.
In addition, it was found that the ship had a dramatic excess of weight that reduced its performance and limited the ability of the Navy to add future models.
The weight of the ship Rhineland-Pfalz is 7,000 tons, and it is twice as heavy as the ships of a similar type that the Germans used in World War II.
With the exception of the helicopter software, the price label of the project -- which also includes staff training -- becomes a problem.
It reached a shocking height of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) - above the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that amplify the newest items make it especially clear that Germany's marine power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Pater Bartles, the head of the Security Committee of the German Parliament, confirmed that today, the Navy has been "the loss of ships capable of carrying out a breach".
The official source said that the problem was accelerated and advanced over time, as old ships were removed from service but not replaced by other vessels.
He expressed his regret that it could not be picked up by any Baden-Wuerttemberg-class.
The national fund of Scotland is listening to the secret life of the bats
A new research carried out at the estate in Scotland is spreading the way bats use the viewer to hunt their own food.
Hope is that the finds will re-energize the behavior of individual flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study conducted by scientists at the Scotland National Fund will follow up on existing bats and European phones and also on brown bearton bats and long ears in Inbreu Inner Boster Ross.
Special tapes will be located at key sites around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also value mobile surveys using handcuffs.
An expert voice analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of bat readings and who understands the species responsible for them.
At the next stage, the map of the living areas is being studied to create a detailed picture of the size of the viewer's face, their patterns of behavior.
Most of the mail, a natural conservation consultant for Scotland National Foundation (NTS), hopes that the results will reveal which areas of life are the most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management work of the living areas, such as the creation of brotherly roots and how to best maintain forest spaces for bats and other related species.
The bat populations in Scotland and throughout Britain were significantly reduced during the previous century.
They're threatened with development and building jobs, which affect the preservation and the loss of living areas.
Spiritism and light can also be dangerous, and the same is true of avian traps and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from housemakers.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, bat ears are more useful in all respects to catch prey.
They use sophisticated DNA tracking technique to track insects and identify obstacles to their flight course.
The NTS fund, which is responsible for the treatment of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important genes and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, treats bats with great seriousness.
She's got 10 skilled experts, who've been able to conduct systematic surveys, design tests, and sometimes rescue.
The organization has also set up the first reserve and the unit dedicated to bats at the T'reve in Dumprez and Galavie, a house for eight out of ten bats in Scotland.
The estate manager David Thompson said that the estate is the ideal territory for them.
Here in Bat'rab, we have a great area for bats, he said.
We've got old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right living areas.
But many things are still not known about bats, so the work we do here and other assets will help us to understand more about what they need to achieve."
He stressed the importance of examining bats before carrying out maintenance work within assets, since the unintended destruction of a single inhabited nest could destroy up to 400 females and adults, and it could also destroy a whole local population.
The bats are a protected species and killing, harassment and interference with bats or the destruction of their nest areas, are prohibited by law.
Elizabeth's, a Scotch officer at the bat conservation fund, encouraged the public to give a shoulder and help.
She said, "We have a lot more to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know what their population situation is."
Ronaldo cancels the rape charges while lawyers prepare to sue the German magazine.
Christiano Ronaldo called the rape charges against him "Pike Nice", and said that people "want to advance themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German newsmagazine Figel, who published the charges.
The pioneer of the Portugal Vivantos team was accused of rapeing an American woman named Catherine Morga, in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
According to suspicion, he then paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, reporting Dr. Spiegel a day.
33-year-old Ronaldo turned to his 142 million associates in Instagram, living a few hours after the announcement of the charges, and called boz for reports of "Fick News".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said yesterday, Pike News, told the camera the player who won the D'Lam five times.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy, good person, and the player added a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Dr. Spiegel for the charges, which were referred to as an "unacceptable report on privacy suspicions", according to the Rotters report.
Lawyer Christian Schretz said that the actor would seek compensation for "injurious damages in the amount corresponding to the material of the violation, and it's probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the last few years".
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 at the casino suite of the Campino Palms Hotel in Vegas.
After meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Miraor returned, according to the report, to the actor's room and actor allegedly raped her, according to documents filed in the District Court of Nevada Clark County.
Morgana claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told her he was a 99 percent good guy who was disappointed in "one percent".
The papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but they agreed.
Morgana also claims that she turned to the police and images of her injuries were taken in the hospital, but then she agreed to settle outside court lines because she felt that she was terrified of revenge and was afraid of being publicly humiliated.
34-year-old says she's now interested in canceling the arrangement because she's still suffering from trauma due to the incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Rachel Madrid from Mansor United at the time of the alleged attack, and he moved to the Italian Yvontes Club in a 100 million euros-valued deal.
BRAKEZET: Britain has ever regretted the loss of car manufacturers.
Britain regrets forever if you lose your position as the world's leading car manufacturer after the Burkzeit, said British business minister Greg Clarke.
He added that the interview by Toyota of Britain to BBC, where she said that if Britain would leave the European Union without an agreement, it would temporarily stop the production at the concrete factory near Derby, it would be "medig".
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the delays at the border in the case of Burkzeit without an agreement could cost jobs.
The Branston plant, which produces the Uris and Oontes of Toyota, produces nearly 150,000 vehicles last year and 90% of them go to the rest of the European Union.
From my point of view, if Britain leaves the European Union at the end of March, we'll see the production break at our factory, says Marvin Cooke, the president of Tuitte in Princeton.
Other UK car manufacturers raised concerns about leaving the European Union without an agreement and how it would affect cross-border trade, including India, BMW, and Viguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will shut down its mini plant in Oxford, for a month after the Burkzeit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks of a supply chain in the case of a brczet without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is run on the basis of time, with parts coming in every 37 minutes, supplying British and the rest of the European Union, to produce cars at the invitation.
If Britain leaves the European Union without an agreement on March 29, it could cause disruptions at the border, causing the sector to lead to delays and failure in parts.
Toyota can't keep a stock worth more than one day at the plant in Drapershire, says the company, so the production will stop.
Clark said that Teresa May's "Cress" program, detailing Britain's future relationship with the European Union, is "accompanied precisely to prevent these tests at the border".
"We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement possible, as I said, not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to take advantage of the opportunity", he said in the BBC's 4th Radio Channel Today program.
“The evidence from the Toyota and other vehicle manufacturers is that it is possible to continue using the successful supply chains set up by us to date, is absolutely essential.”
Toyota didn't say how long the production break was going to last, but for the longer term, she warned that adding expenses would damage the competitions of the factory and would eventually cause the cuts.
Peter Zabalaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years, and serves as president of the Unite Union at the factory, said that members of the union are more and more concerned: "Manicion, if the jobs are reduced, they will never be restored.
"We have proposed a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union".
Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, which is dependent on her, may be "revolution for another week" while the fight against the candidate for the Supreme Court, Bert Kwano, continues, said, "the White House on A day."
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller, who investigates Russian intervention in the elections, links Trump's assistants to Russia and the possible closure of investigation proceedings by the President.
The D.C. gossip has been a deal for months on the question whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General and jeopardize Muller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein Dan could carry a wire to record the conversations with Trump and get the president to be removed by means of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on the last day of the year, he came to the White House, and according to the reports, he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for the day of the 'with Trump', six at the time of Rosensstein's arrival in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that it would be better not to fire Rosenstein but at this point the meeting was rejected to prevent a collision with the hearing at the Senate Judicial Committee, where one of the women who accused him of improper sexual behavior, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On the day and the day, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the claims against Kavanau, and rebutting the vote in the Senate.
Trump's speaker, Sarah Sanders, showed up at the Fox News Channel on A-day.
In reply to the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is not yet a date set for the meeting, it may exist this week, I can see another week's rejection in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'm always happy to update the press."
Some reporters have challenged this claim: Sanders has not conducted a press briefing of the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the host asked why.
Sanders said that the radios rarely came up with a resonance from the TV reporter, although she said, "I won't deny that they're taking a stand."
Then she offered to increase the direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The President has more questions and answers than any president before him", she said, adding without quoting evidence: "We have checked the numbers."
The press reports are still on, Sanders said, but if the press has an opportunity to present questions directly to the President of the United States, it's much better than to talk to me.
We have often tried to do so, and you have seen that we have done it many times in the past few weeks, and meetings that will allow us to speak to the President of the United States, to change the press instructions.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open meetings or news parties when he visits.
Only his press parties are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have made the reason for this, at a loose and sometimes strange show before writers who gathered in a place.
The health service writes to the employees of the European Union at the NHS Scotland and deals with concerns about the Brixite.
The Health Service wrote to the team of workers from the European Union, who are employed in Scotland’s National Health Service, to express the country’s gratitude and to request that they stay after the Brixite.
The Scotty Parliamentary Company Jin Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain's exit from the European Union.
The government of Scotland has already committed itself to applying for a permanent status for the citizens of the European Union working in its mined public services.
Ms. Freeman wrote in a letter: “In the summer, the British-European Union negotiations on exit continued, and he is moving towards the expected decisions in the fall.
But the British government has also promoted the honesty of a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this period may be very worrying for all of you.
That's why I wanted to go back and say how much I appreciate each member of the team's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
Fellows from all over the European and World Union bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit the patients and the congregations we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home, and we want you to stay here very much."
Christyon Abrekombi undergoes emergency surgery after he has suffered a head injury.
The back shield from the Tensey University tiger group, Christyon Barkombi, went through an emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury from the loss of 31-27 on Saturday to the Komdors Group from Wenderblat University, Mike Organ's report from Tanzania.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tensey's university team, told the reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half the time.
"He went to the courthouse and just collapsed there," said Reid.
The coaches and the medical team gave Abercombi oxygen on the edge of the field and then brought it up on a stretcher and took it to another test.
A member of the University of Tancy told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, tribal, that Abercombi was transferred to surgery at the Wenderblat Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/scope of surgery" and Tancy University is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Aberkombi is an athletic student and this is his first season with a tennis university after a transfer from Illinois.
He was involved in five only repairs before he left the game, and he picked up his bags for the 18th season.
Buyers of foreign goods with higher stock in the UK.
Foreign buyers will be assigned higher shares when purchasing assets in Britain and the additional income will be used to help homeless people, according to the new conservation program.
The move will disable Corbin's move to attract new voters.
The Poles Regulations are for those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The treasure expects the tax to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers are engaged in a higher number of stamps when they buy a British asset -- the income supplement will be used to help the homeless, announce Teresa May today.
The move seems to be an attempt to reverse Jeremy Corbin's performance to attract young voters, with promises to provide cheaper housing and focus on higher incomes.
The stamp tax is imposed on people and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, and the addition of revenues will strengthen the government's move to help those who are old in difficult conditions.
The payment, which comes in addition to the current stamp tax, including higher tax levels over secondary residences and real estate investments in the need for rent, may reach a height of three percent.
The treasure expects the move to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
According to the estimate, 13 percent of London's newly built assets are purchased by foreign residents, the situation that causes rising prices and makes it difficult for people who purchase a property first to set a foot on the housing scale.
Many wealthy countries in the country -- especially the capital -- have become the Wraith Gates because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of his time outside the country.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called out to cut down the pool to help young people buy a first house.
He accused large companies of expensive real estates, since they are taking land but not using them, and the speed at the back of the May to abandon the cover on houses at a reasonable price and to repair Britain's “housing” of housing.
Corbin announced the series of interactive reforms in the area of housing, including rent control and the discontinuation of the pension “without guilt”.
He also wants to give the Council greater power to build new houses.
May said, "Last year I said that I would devote my period of office to restoring the British dream -- which they were told is that life should be better for every new generation.
Which means it's a correction of our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build lives here.
However, it is not true that people who do not live in Britain, as well as societies that are found in foreign countries, can easily acquire houses as hard-working British residents.
The dream of becoming a houseowner has become too remote for too many people, and the humiliation of sleeping under difficult conditions is too real."
My ultimate destination is to run Scotland.
Director Sandland's Jack Ross said his "an ultimate destination" is to become the Director of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scots are enjoying the North East club's life challenges, which are now in third place in the first league, three points away from the pre-description.
He moved to the summer light stadium after leading St. Myren back to the first place in Scotland in the last season.
I wanted to play for my country as an actor.
I once participated in the international game, and that's it." Ross said to the Scotch BBC Sportson program.
But when I grew up, I watched the Scotland team play with a lot of Hampden with my father as a child, and it was always something that kept me back.
Anyway, this opportunity will only come if I manage the team."
Sandland's former directors include Dick Adbokt, David Moiz, Sam Elardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kane, Gus Foy, and Faulu de Canio.
Alawa's former director at Telek says that he was not afraid to come up with such well-founded names at such a large club, after he turned down previously offers from Bernsley and Epswichtown.
"For me, success will now be measured by what I say. Can I return the club to Framier League?"
Because of the structure and the facilities at this club, he obviously belonged to Parmier Ligg," he said.
It's not an easy task to get him there, but I can see myself as a success story here only if I can get the club back there.
Ross started his management career only three years ago, after a time as assistant manager in Dumberton and 15 months as a team coach of the Hearts.
At the next stage, he helped Allah get out of Mega G and brought St. Myren out of the wonder into position as the winner of the championship in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his game career in Calid, Hartelpo, Polkirk, St. Myren and Milton Academy.
"It must have been a true stop," he recalled, about taking the command of Elijah.
I really believed that the management position was a match for me, more than the game.
It sounds weird because I played all right, I made a reasonable profit, and I enjoyed some of the right.
But an actor's career can be difficult.
There's a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still dealing with everything about stress and stress at work, but management just feels right.
I've always wanted to run and now I'm doing it, and I've never felt more comfortable with myself as an adult."
You'll listen to the full interview at Sportson, September 30, at the Scotland radio between 12:00 and 13:00, according to the British Summer clock.
The perfect time for pent beer is at 17:30 a.m. on Saturday, in the poll.
The rising summer heat wave has caused the profits of the British wolves struggling to exist, but it has put pressure on the restaurant networks.
Groups of barbs and bars enjoyed sales at 2.7 percent in July -- but restaurant incomes dropped 4.8 percent, data revealed.
Peter Martin, from CGA Business Advisory, who collected the data, said: “The meaning of the continuation of the clear weather and the long-term participation of England in the World Cup is that July was a pattern similar to that of June, as the pup income rose 2.8 percent, but the restaurants suffered even more severe.
The decline in 1.8 percent in the trade in restaurants that was observed in June only in July.
Babies and bars that focus on drinks have recorded the strongest performances, with a higher rate of income growth in restaurant business compared to the previous period.
They also suffered from the sun, although their situation was less dramatic than that of restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In the bar and bar networks, alcohol sales rose by 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, from the RSM for Feasy and Hospital Management, said: "These results are continuing the growth we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of sports or social events are the most important factors in terms of the free market outside the home.
It's not surprising that groups of restaurants are continuing to fight, although a decrease of 4.8 percent in sales compared to last year would be particularly painful in addition to all half of the regular expenses.
The long and hot summer couldn't have come at a worse moment to food-focused business, and the time would say if the more sophisticated temperatures we've experienced in August would come down to what, they need so much."
The increase in sales in wells and restaurants, including new openings, stood at 2.7 percent in July, and the slow pace of branding.
The process of monitoring sales for the United Kingdom's wells, bars and restaurants, the Coffer Peach Tracker, collection and performance data surgeons from 47 groups, with a round of nine billion lW business, and is measuring the performance comparison set in the mine.
One out of all five children has accounts in the social media that they hide from their parents.
A survey revealed that of all five children — only 11 years of age — there are secret accounts in the social media that they hide from parents and teachers.
Survey, which included 20,000 middle school students, revealed a growth in fake instincts.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sex content.
20% of the students said they had a "head" account that they show to parents.
One out of five children — only 11 of them — creates accounts in the social media that he keeps secret from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Insta accounts - as a reminder of the site of the image sharing, Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they were running a clean "head" account to show their parents, but they also had private accounts.
A mother who ran into her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found that she was asking others to rape me.
The study, conducted by the Digital Access UK and the HMC of the British Independent Schools found 40% of students aged 11 to 18 who have two profiles and their satisfactions admit that they have private accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Bocknan, said: "The mystery that so many young people are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eiled Doyle will be used as a voice for the athletes at the Scottish Athletes Directorate.
Eiled Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athlete Directorate as an external architect at the annual General Assembly of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the cheapest and cheapest athlete in the world. Ian Betty described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who guide their sports branches to benefit from the rich experience of the international level during the last decade.
"Eiled won great respect among the Scottish, British and global athletic community, and we're sure the Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from the construction of the board," he said.
"I am eager to be used as a voice for athletes and hope that I can contribute and really help with the showdown in Scotland."
The U.S., who won 200-400 meters in the Olympic Games in 1996 in Atlanta, and four Olympic gold medals in all, now regularly used in the BBC, lost his ability to walk after he suffered a brain stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
Doctors said it's time to say whether it's good or how good.
It was a wild job, but I've completely recovered how to go and now exercises speed and response speed!
Thank you for your encouragement!
Publisher of milk pumps comparing fertility mothers to an online opinion party
A company for milk pumping into a network of online opinions with an awareness that is comparable to that of mothers from a cow-breeding plant.
To point out the pump pack that is supposed to be the World's "Silver Milk Pump", Elvie's Technology Company for Private Users, a humorist video advert to highlight the freedom of action that the new pump gives to mothers.
Four real mothers danced in a full-blown cow barn singing a song that included words like, "Yeah, I swear to myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed it, it's not hard, it's my breasts."
The song play goes on and says, "Sweet, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, I'm milking my girls."
But the ad, published on the company Facebook page, has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of responses, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many said it was spreading light on the "funs" of the milk industry.
"The decision is very bad to use to publish the product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and have a baby to make milk, but their babies are stolen from them in a few days after the escape," wrote someone.
Elvie's milk pump combines discreetly within the cleaning bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment said: “Tramatically traumatized to the cow and to the calf as one.
But, hey, why don't you use them to publish a milk pump to mothers who keep their babies?
Another comment said: "The ad's completely off."
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought that the song was "a laugh."
I think it's a genius idea.
I'd buy one if I was still a mechanic.
The pain caused me to feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I referred to its content.
It's a genius product, wrote someone.
Another comment said: this is a funny ad for lying mothers (often in their workplaces or in the bathroom) and feeling like "farms".
It's not a sign that you're supplicating or judging the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women's team finds out that they were all dancing with the discreet pumps inside their bras.
The idea that behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women, who use milk, say they feel like cows.
But Elvie's pump is completely quiet, with no pipes and strings, it combines discreetly with the cleaning front and gives women the freedom to move, to keep their babies, and even to go out at the time of birth.
Anna Bellarine, a partner and head of the Early Development Department in the Mother, stated: "The Elvie pump is such a Greek product that has come to it with a bold and proactive drink.
By making comparisons between women expressing themselves and cows, we wanted to place the milk deposits and all the challenges in it in the light of the insects, and to demonstrate in a way that he can be identified, the amazing sense of freedom that the new source will provide.
It's not the first time Elvie's mortgage makes headlines.
During London's fashion week, Mom and two kids walked the track for the designer Martha Jacobowski using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children were transferred quietly to a tent camp at the Texas border
The number of immigrant children in Zinc custody, although several half of the monthly border remains unchanged, for one reason is that the leadership and policy of the Trump Director has been hard on the child ' s transfer to foster homes.
Usually, most of the caregivers were undocumented immigrants, and they were afraid of endangering their ability to remain in the country by presenting a candidate for responsibility for a child.
The risk for a man in June, when the federal authorities declared that they would be granted potential protection and other adult households would have to hand over fingerprints, and these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Ma'o Albins, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to Congress that the authorities had arrested dozens of people who applied for protection for minors without supervision.
The authority then confirmed that 70% of the detainees had not been criminal before.
Nearly 80% of the guards or their homes are illegally located in the country, and a large part of them are criminals from foreign countries.
That's why we keep chasing these people," said Mr. Albins.
In order to deal with solutions for children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that some of them would need to appear before a court within a month of their arrest, instead of 60 days as required by the previous regulations, shelter workers were reported.
Many will appear through a video conference, instead of face-to-face, to present their arguments for legal standing to a immigration judge.
Those who are not entitled to release will be expelled quickly.
The longer these children stay in security, the longer they're expected to develop anxiety and depression, and this situation may lead to violent explosions or escape attempts, said shelter workers and reports published by the system in the last few months.
Counselors say that these fears are overcome by bigger facilities such as Turnello, where it is likely that signs of a child's difficulties will be removed, due to the size of the facility.
They have added that having children moved to a tent city without giving them enough time to be emotionally prepared or separated from friends can make the trauma that many have already faced worse.
Syria says to the American, French, and Turkish ‘ conquer forces ’ to withdraw too quickly.
In front of the United Nations General Court, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Al-Houted also called the Syrian parliaments home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Disappeared, also as Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the excuse that they were fighting terrorism, and they were treated accordingly.
"They have to withdraw too quickly and without conditions," he said to the arrest.
The "war of terrorism almost ended" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been taken from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to fight this holy battle until we cleared the Syrian lands of the terrorist organizations and of any illegal alien presence it was.
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly in need of training and advice for the Syrian and Syrian forces that oppose the President of Israel.
France has over 1,000 warriors on the land of war.
As far as the refugees are concerned, it is ignored that the conditions for their return are good and the charges of certain Western states in the "dispersion of unreasonable fears" that led the refugees to stay away.
"We called the international community and the humanitarian organizations to help them return," he said.
They're making politics for its kind that's only supposed to be a humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no assistance for Syria's reconstruction until a political agreement was reached between Sweden and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idelev, the last great rebel holding, created an opportunity for progress in political negotiation.
The Russian-Turkish Convention prevented the extensive attack of the Syrian forces in support of the Russians on the province, where three million people lived.
However, the emphasis of the agreement was on clear deadlines and expressed the hope that the military action would focus on the Jews, including warriors from the victory front associated with the Al-Qaida organization, which was destroyed.
UN Secretary Stefan de Mistura hopes to convene very soon the first meetings of a new committee, which will consist of government members and opposition, to draft a post-war package and to pave the way for election.
Conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee were ignored and said that the panel work should be limited to “the examination of the meetings of the current Constitution”, and he warned against interference.
Why is Trump gonna win a second sentence?
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberals are looking forward to the conclusion, denial and scandal will end his office before his time.
While there is no doubt that the most dramatic final chapter in the history of the presidency at all times!
Right now, there are no signs of fatigue at the audiences.
Since 2014, peaks have risen from double to 1.05 million viewers in CNN and almost paid themselves to 1.6 million viewers in MSNBC.
The average of Fox News stands at 2.4 million viewers in record hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the "Richel Media Show" of MSNBC, reached the top of the Wrighting of the cable with up to 3.5 million viewers on important news items.
"That's the fire where people are kept because it's not something we understand," said Neil Bar, the actual producer of the ABC drama series, "the target survivor", who is engaged in a state secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the capital.
Lanelle Scoble, writing old comedies and the book "Only the funny parts: and some tough truths about getting into the Hollywood men's circle" has another theory.
She remembers a cab drive in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
She's a question.
"He said, "Because he's funny to me," she told me Mrs. Scoble.
In the meantime, there is value to it.
Of course, unlike all other TV programs, the plot lines from Washington can determine the future of the "Ru v. Wade" ruling, whether immigrant families can reunite and global economic health.
Changing channels or ignoring them are allowed only the most experienced viewers can afford.
And yet, you're breaking limits being intelligent citizens when you've been watching yourselves for six hours at the panel of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward's "secret informant" as a source of "fear", a "bombers leather jacket worth $15,000" of Paul Manport ( "heavy garment", according to Washington Post) and the consequences of Daniels' disparate theories on, and sorry for the expression, the Anatomy of Trump.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"some of what he's doing, having a feeling similar to that of a reality show, is that he's feedin' you on something every night," said Bert Montgomary, director of the Wellhouse Environment and created the "history for sale" program, about the team that replaces the Tramp show and the daily moves of her home (the war with the NFL League, the praise of Kim Gong-on).
You can't afford to lose one chapter or stay behind.
When I got to Mr. Flyce this week, it was clear out there with a temperature of about 26 degrees north coast of the Kawai island, but it closed down to watch the MSNBC, and recorded the CNN in parallel.
He couldn't disable, not when Bert Kwano was prepared to face the Senate Legal Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is at stake.
"I remember the times when we did all these crazy shows before and people said, "This is the beginning of the Western civilization," Mr. Place told me.
I thought it was a joke, but apparently they were right."

Money from outside sources oscillates the race to the tightest middle class of Congress.
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th County is facing a financial crisis, thanks to the reorganisation of Congress, which brought two Congressmen to the race on the same seat.
The district of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been re-established, has put the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who has won his seat in another district, in special elections in the last spring.
Lamb ran against another congressman, Republican Keith Roth's, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which has been greatly bordered with the new 17th district.
The map was re-reared after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former district division had undermined, and contrary to the Constitution, the results for the benefit of the Republicans.
The new 17th district race launched a battle against the financial riots on the campaign between the financial weapons of the large parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a victory in the special elections in March, which won a wide-ranging view for 18th Congress in Pennsylvania.
The seat belonged to the Republicans for over a decade, and President Trump won a 20-point district.
Political interpretations were expecting an easy advantage for the democracies.
The United States had decided to punish Al Salvador for its support in China, and then retreated.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already met in Beijing, with a slight resistance on the part of Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Fanma, Juan Carlos and Arla, in June 2017, and held the hotel in Panama until his partners divorced the Trump management team.
Foreign Office officials have decided to return the head of the American diplomatic expeditions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in response to the "last decisions no longer known as the Tigion", said Herr Nort, the Office's spokesman, in a statement at the beginning of the month.
But the imposition of sentences was only against Salvador, which, according to the estimate, received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The penalties, which included cuts in economic assistance and restrictions on admission visas, could have hurt the country from Central America with high unemployment and homicide classes.
As the internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America rejected an urgent conference that was supposed to focus on security and economic prosperity so as to continue with a similar meeting last year, which was taken as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from reaching the United States.
But in the middle of September, senior government officials made their desire to promote the assembly clear, and they concluded all the penalty systems against Salvador.
Vice President Mike Fance is now supposed to turn to the conference participants, who are now set up in the middle of October, as a symbol of the importance of the government, said the diplomas.
And three American messengers returned quietly to Al Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without messages or new severe punishments from Washington.
The White House Speaker of Bolton refused to respond to the details of the discussion that were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal discussions, provided they remained silent there.
Their explanations were supported by an external analyst, closer to the government, who also spoke out there in a trance.
Learning History
The following may well come from the Special Adviser Robert Muller's report on the alleged disruption of Trump's investigations, whose wives now have significant evidence in public records.
Muller is turning his investigation, according to reports, to the question whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in its attacks on our election system.
If Congress has changed, Trump will find himself judging and accounting for this body, as soon as he is ready to face the voters again, and perhaps a jury.
There's a lot of questions here that start with "M" and I don't intend to claim that Trump's fall is inevitable -- not even of those who fill the corresponding roles in Europe.
From both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers would have been willing to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West had opposed him and supported China in Yemen.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to prevent the years of death that resulted.
The history move revolves around such turning points, and the cycle of democracy that cannot be stopped, accelerated, or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of such points.
What are we gonna do if Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this paper reported last year he offered to register the president secretly and put the headlines on his non-conformation to the president.
Rosenstein said the Times report is not accurate.
How do we react if the F.B.I. investigation of Bert Kwano, recently requested, is not full or fair - or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible charges of sexual assault and false committees?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of the confederation election and be named Congress on Trump the responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter sleep.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was expelled to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that in the past had also taken away the fancy house I had.
She survived, a live to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light candles Saturday on the same table that covered the circus cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Graham Doranes from Ring's Optimistic to the Battles at Raped Vienna
The Rangers host Rafid Vienna on the fifth day, and know that we win the Austrians, after the impressive case against Vieriel in Spain earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to devastate the G Group in the European League.
An injury in your knee prevented Graham Doranes from being in contact to show up for the first time in the season until 2-2 with Viral, but he believes that Ring's could use this result as a leap for better performance.
"That was a good point for us because Viral is a good group," said 31-year-old footballer.
We went to the game out of faith that we could get something and get a point.
We could have won at the end, but, by all means, the case was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we got out of the freeze in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
I hope we can get three points but it'll be a tough game because they've achieved a good result in their last game, but with the audience behind us, I'm convinced we can push and get a positive result.
The last year has been really hard, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but there's a good feeling about the place now.
The team's good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, put the last season behind and make it.
Women stay awake because of this fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that the poll participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, only a few people were talking about it with their family members.
As half of the participants in the Nationalweed survey said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of the chronic treatment for a long time.
Only 10% said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family to take care of them, but they don't take steps to have the conversation," said Holly Schneider, vice president of the National Life Insurance Society.
We can do this next way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare the family for treatment if you don't express your wishes long before the date.
Help your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get treatment, since these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
The consultant can also help you find a way to pay for the expenses.
Your funding options for long-term maintenance care may include a long-term traditional insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with an amount of money to help cover expenses, or self-insurance with your money - as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: Find an early solution to legal struggles at this opportunity.
Find out how powerful health care is, a reliable person who will oversee your medical care and make sure that professionals fulfill your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
They've also considered signing on powering all over your money.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions if you are in a position and make a payment if you are not qualified.
Don't forget the details: Imagine your old parent has a medical emergency and he's on his way to the hospital.

Federal prosecutors seek a death penalty that is rare for suspected terrorist attacks in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York ask for the death penalty for Saipolo Seifov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal crime in the country since 1953.
A 30-year-old Sybop used the claim in a lounge truck of the Depo to hit a bicycle track alongside the highway West Side in the south of Manhattan, and a foot-to-mouth dance and bike ride that got on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Sipob deliberately killed the eight victims and caused “in the first place” severe bodily injuries, according to a declaration of intent to seek the death penalty, which was filed in the south quarter of New York.
According to the court's document, a death penalty can be required for two of these charges.
Weeks after the attack, a member of a federal jury wrote an indictment with 22 guests, including eight charges of extortion aid, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, violence and the destruction of prohibited vehicles.
The attack called for "a significant pre-preparation and intent", said the prosecutors, and described the manner in which the attack was conducted as "a humiliating, cruel and sick one".
"Sipolo, Sipopop" caused harm, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angni, Nicholas Kelves, N-Lor Deced, Darren Drake, Ariel Fréché, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Daminin Pionuku", written in a statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the south quarter of New York has claimed a death penalty in the case that occurred a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but he was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time that death was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Thel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after their conviction to contact a spy for the Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Two Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Seifov, the son of Uzbekistan, did not express feelings of regret in the days and months after the attack.
He said to the investigators that he felt good about his actions, he said to the police.
Seifov told the authorities that he had been inspired to attack after watching videos of noise on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to the police, he also asked to hang a flag of alarm in the hospital room where he was.
He claimed to be innocent in response to the 22-year-old essay.
David Patton, one of the federal defenses representing Siobov, said they were, of course, disappointed in the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to ask for a death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt that would lead to a life sentence without the possibility of release, only a date for the rest of those events on all involved," said Paton.
Siobov's Singapore team once asked the prosecutors not to require a death penalty.
A member of Parliament Marnie says that he has to appoint the Naig 'l Prague' to be responsible for negotiating the Brixite.
Today, during a protest at the Council of Guards, Nig'l Faraj's Nord has joined the army of the people.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians have to feel pressure from the engagements - when a member of Parliament from Teresa May's Watchers Party claimed that he should be responsible for negotiating with the European Union.
Parliamentary Parliamentman Peter Boone said that in Bramingham that Britain was already out at this point if Prague was their secretary.
But the challenge ahead of him is May, the very mixed lines of the guards, introduced by the members of the conservatives who supported the stay in the European Union for a different demonstration against the Brixite in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to leave her plan of settlement, the Cruss, on her way despite attacks by the Brixite supporters, the remaining supporters and the European Union.
The Allies insisted that she continue to try and reach an agreement with Briselle despite counter-reactions -- and force the engagement of the Laavor and the Labour Party to choose between her agreement and 'Taho and Bohu'.
Boone said at a meeting of the Leave Means Leaven in Seoul that he wanted to say goodbye to Cars.
He claimed that Prague had to be accepted as a friend and responsible for negotiating with Briselle.
If he was in charge, we'd be out at this point, he said.
Parliamentary member of Mollingboro added: "I'll protect the Bertzite but we need to break up with the Cres."
He stressed his opposition to the European Union and said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be enslaved.
We want to establish our own rules in our own country.
Mr. Boone dismissed the public opinion that has changed since the vote in 2016: the idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain completely false.
The Parliamentary Parliamentary Society and the Supporter of the Brixite Andrea Jenkins was also a lawyer and said to the reporters: "I'm simply saying, "Listen to the people."
The 'Crac' program is not popular among the public at large, the opposition won't vote for it, it's not popular among our party and among our actors who went out to the streets and chose us in the first place.
Please, leave the cheetah and start listening.
By means of a critical message intended for who, she added: “Government heads keep their servant when they keep their promises”.
Farag said at the meeting, that it should make politicians feel pressure if they're about to betray the decision that was made in the People's Question in 2016.
It's now about a question of trust between us, the people, and our political position, he said.
They're trying to cheat on the Burkzeit and we're here today to tell them that we won't let you get away from his work.
He added, in a message to the enthusiastic audience: "I want you to make our political position, which is about to betray the Brakzet, feel pressure.
We call this country's Army of the People, who gave us the victory in the Brakzet and who will never rest until we become independent, independent and proud Britain.
At that moment, the remaining supporters walked in the Ramingham and then set up a two-hour conference in the center of town.
An active handful was blown in the pre-arranged anti-Berczeit czars after the team's establishment this weekend.
Lybour's friend Lord Sires commended the opening of the conference for the security issues they had endured with the party's app.
It's about people who tell us they can have IT systems and all possible technology to make an agreement like Canada Plus, to cross a border without friction and to trade without borders in Ireland', he added.
This is ridiculous.
There's no such thing as a good Burkzeit, he added.

Walt went to the middle jail first and let Hamilton fit into the movement of the competing tail, apparently knowing a decision.
The Marchdens team went to the middle of a round later and returned to the race behind Walt, but Milton went forward after a tight wheel struggle that eventually forced the Ferrari driver to leave the course to endure without risk after a double move at the third corner.

The team did an extraordinary job to get to Dublin," said Hamilton.

President Donald Trump commended Senator Diane Finstein at a Saturday meeting, arguing that he had not leaked a letter from Christine Blyse Ford, accusing Bert Kwano of being in the Supreme Court, sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, but said that it took place in the Senate to show that people are “bad, mean and liars”.

When you look at the advertisements and the leaks and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do that.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Finstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... Did you leak the document-- Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
"I didn't leak."
So, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak," he added in the senator's invention.

"I didn't hide the charges of Dr. Ford, I didn't leak her story," said Finstein to the Committee, according to The Hill newspaper.
"She asked me to keep him secret and to keep the letter confidential as he asked me to."
But it doesn't seem that the senator's denial was accepted by the president, who responded to her during the Sunday night meeting: "I'm telling you, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe it's not the [bleep], but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continued to protect the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was guilty of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, and claimed that the democracy was using charges for their own ends.
“ They are determined to return to rule at all costs.
You see the wicked, the arrogant, they don't care who they're hurting, who they're running on the way to rule and power," said the President, according to Mediaitis's report.

Analyst details the move of events the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution proved the case on Saturday, at the retrial of a man who was put in a woman from Mississippi's cage while she was alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roult from the U.S. Department of Justice has been testifying for hours as a witness expert in the field of intelligence analysis.

According to a report by the Claryon Ledger, Roult said that he received the location data from a number of mobile phones that he saw teles had been with Chambers the night he died, hiding his previous claims.

Another black man?
A New York therapist sued a couple for pectory after a text message was sent racistly.
A New York therapist sued a couple for pectory on the tipping floor after receiving a text that was not directed to her from the mother who complained that the therapist was “more black man. ”
The couple denied that he was racist and compared the claim to extortion.
Lynice Falsco-Flexman, if for two, expressed disappointment when she found out that her new children's carer, Giselle Morris, was black at the time she arrived on the first day of work in 2016.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent her back to Morris twice.
According to a New York Post report, after noting the perversion of the mouth, Felisco-Flexman fired Ms. Morris, saying that the former African-American therapist had done a bad job, and she was now expecting to be employed in the Philippines.
Mrs. Morris received payment for one working day and was sent to her home with Ober.

"I want to show them, look, don't do things like that," she said to post a day and added, "I know it's an illusion."
The couple returned a war on the allegations that they were racist and said that the end of Morris' deal was required, fearing that they could not trust her after they hit her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," said her husband, J'all Falsco, to Post.

A new letter finds out that Pendington's broadcasters were afraid the readers wouldn't be identified with a talking bear.
The daughter of Bond, Karen Gunkel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said about the letter: "It's hard to imagine yourself in the place of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It's very interesting to know now what we know about the enormous success of Paddington."
After saying that her father, who worked at BBC as a photographer before being inspired to write the Children's Book from a small toy, was becoming a bloodthirsty about the rejection of his work, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "Mer-baby," after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of Pedington's success, which he described as "a very important member of our family."
"He was a quiet man, not a arrogant man," she said.
But because Pedington was so real to him, it was almost like you had a child who got something: you're proud of him even though it wasn't for you.
I think he's seen Pedington's success about that.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always said it was because of Pedington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say hello on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was transferred to the hospital of Louis Pasteer 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Ned called in a clean way and said that her condition was really bad, which you can't expect to keep going." said Mrs. Ednan Lapraus.
And then I got a call from Mende where he said that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I should say good-bye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashie, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The meds that the doctors gave her so that she could keep going to the rhythms and get out of her system.
She died sometime before, and it's over, it's all over.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing it all happens.
I couldn't turn around or scream or cry because I was surrounded right now by families and people.
I really had to hold on."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan Lapraus, in mourning now for the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane alongside other passengers, who were unaware of the journey.
Nobody knew," she said.
My head was loaded, and tears went down all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had a lovely sense of identification with Ned.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women who shed lots of light on the bridge to prevent suicide

Mrs. Davis said, "I'm afraid of a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis created the discoveries, so that people will know that there is someone to turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence-- you need to talk."
Mrs. Humprez, Mrs. Davis' friend for years, lost Mark, a life partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at the bottom of the stairs on Christmas Day when the kids opened the presents he didn't make eye contact or something."
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they were overcome by: "It creates a hole in the family.
It rips us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Bert Kwano's future is at stake when the FBI starts its investigation.
I thought, if we could really get what he asked for -- a time-limited and limited investigation -- maybe we could get a little to the union, said Felix on Saturday and added that he was worried that the committee had been "crushed" at the end of the exorbitant party deadlock.
Why didn't Cavanau and his Republican supporters be interested in the FBI investigation?
Their resonance comes from the timing.
The mid-Centre elections will last only five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as expected, the Republicans will not succeed in them, they will be very weak in their attempts to bring the man they want to the highest court in the country.
George Wo' Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to try to support Kwano, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI takes out its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 republics and 49 dictatorships are now cast.
It's still not clear whether Kevano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so that vice-president Mike Pance can break the tie and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of narcissors in North Korea is under Kim.
A number of North Koreans to South Korea have been down since Kim Gong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean lawman.
The Bing-Sig Park quoted data from the South Korean Union Office and said that last year's number was 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the main causes of this were a deeper border review between North Korea and China and its rise in human incomes.
Pyongyang did not make a public statement.
Most North Korean deserters eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
According to Ceol, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, where North Korea has the longest border and where it is easier to cross compared to the DMZ has kept well between two Korean states.
China treats narcissists as illegal, not as refugees, and often returns them in abetting fashion.
The relationship between the north and the south -- technically still in the war -- has improved considerably in the last few months.
Earlier, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss talks focusing on nuclear disarmament negotiations.
The meeting took place after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Gong-on in Singapore, where the two agreed generally to move towards a century when half of the Korean island would not hold nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young-ho, they accused the sanctions that the United States of America had made in the absence of progress since then.
Without trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there can be no way that we can unilaterally separate our weapons first, Ree Noummo said in front of the United Nations General Court in New York.
Nancy Flussy calls Bert Kwano "Heistri", saying he's not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The presiding officer of the House of Choices, Nancy Flussy, called the Supreme Court's Supreme Court candidate "theist" and said that his character did not allow him to serve in the Supreme Court.
Plusy responded on a Saturday interview at the Texas Trivione Festival in Texas.
I couldn't help but think if a woman ever appeared like this, they'd say "heistry," Plusy said about her reaction to Kavanau's testimony to the Senate's Legal Committee on the day of the ".
Kavano enthusiastically rejected the claim that Dr. Christine Blaise Ford was sexually assaulted when both of them were adults.
During his opening speech, Kavanau was very emotional, and at times he almost screamed and became angry when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He also defended the principle of democracy on the Commission and called for his arguments against "the murder of a coordinated character and grutsky " which was organized because of the anger of the liberals for the fact that Hillary Clinton lost his election to the presidency in 2016.
Plusy said that Kavanau's testimony has proved that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court because it has shown a prior opinion against the Democracies.
"I think he took himself out with these statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the democracy," she said.
In addition, he failed her when he said that he would try to eliminate his anger if he was happy, and if the democracy won most of the House of Choices.
I say so -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI then he doesn't fit, not only for the high court, but also for the court where he's now, he said plusy.
Kavano is now a judge in the Federal Court of Appeals of Columbia.
She has concerns about possible cessation of Kwano against Obama's health reform or the Waid judgment, since he is considered Judge Maran.
At his hearing of confirmation, Kavano avoided wishes regarding the possibility of repealing certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
There's no reason for a man who's hysterical and ridiculous in his opinions to go to court and expect it to be said, "That's not great," he said.
And women need to use it.
It's a critical review, months and years of rage on its back, and it can't express it without crying.
"We're crying when we get mad," she told me Mrs. Steinen 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, do I?"
She went on, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was running somewhere else, who said that she also cried when she got upset, but every time she got upset and started crying, she used to tell the man that she was talking to, "Maybe you think I'm sad that I'm crying.
I'm mad."
And then she just pulled.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears get left as a result of rage, among others because they are not aware of what they are.
One of my most significant memories comes from an early stage of my life, in the office with most of my men, is that I found myself once crying in an indescribable rage, and an older woman caught my back, it was a cool manager from which I was always a little scared -- and dragged me to the stairwell room.
"Don't let them see you ever cry," she told me.
'They don't know you're running a rage.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they've managed to get you depressed."
Patricia Schroeder, who was a congressman from Colorado at the same time, worked with Gary Hart during the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Art caught an out-of-married novel manager on a ship named Monkey Business and left the race, Schroeder, who was deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason she wouldn't consider the idea of dealing with the presidency herself.
She told me 30 years later and she laughed.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another challenge.
Someone called it "The Snow and the Seven Twilights."
Because she joined the election campaign at a late stage, she joined the fundraising and therefore swore she wouldn't join the race unless she was in $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who contributed $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"They think I'm getting a discount." She was wondering.
When the speech announced that you would not open up on a formal campaign, the feelings were so intense - that you thanked the people you supported, you were disappointed by the system that had so hard to raise money and focus on the voters instead of the representatives, and you were angry with the sexual darkness - she was suffocating tears.
"You could think I had a nervous breakdown," she recalled that Roder had responded to the press about her.
"You could think I'd received alimony from Klanks.
I remember thinking, what would they write about my condition?
"She cried"?
How the trade war between the United States and China can be beneficial to Biging
The openings of the U.S.-China Trade War were ear-drums, and although the battle is far from over, a nation-to-state breach may be useful for Big'ing in the long term, say experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, shot the opening shot earlier this year when he taxed important Chinese export products, including solar coils, steel and aluminium.
The most significant Islam took place this week with new estimates that affected 200 billion dollars ($150 million) of goods, in fact taxing half of the goods exported to the United States from China.
Big's responded at the same time, and recently up to 15% of the collection on US goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has committed itself to bringing back a hit on every hit by the United States, and it's unlikely that the world's second-sized economy will surrender in the near future.
A request from Washington to return to what is meant by accepting its demands, but public access to the United States would be too embarrassing for President Shei Ginfing.
However, experts say that if Biging manages properly, the stress from the U.S. Trade War may positively support China in the long term, and reduce the mutual dependency between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the beginning of economic liberalization in each of the countries is actually far more dangerous than India’s former viewers”, said Abigail Grace, a research partner focused in Asia, on the New American Security think tank.
Syria is ready to return the refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says that it is ready to return from the will of the refugees and call for assistance to rebuild the country that was destroyed in a long war that will last for more than seven years.
In a speech to the arrest of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Houted said the conditions in the country were improving.
As the situation in a more stable and secure area thanks to progress made in the war on terrorism, he said.
The government continues to re-establish areas destroyed by terrorists in order to re-establish the situation.
All the conditions now exist for the refugees to return from their free will to the country that they left because of terrorism and unilateral economic steps to harm their daily lives and their livelihood.
According to UN estimates, over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Hort said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that the regime would not receive grant or assistance from countries that have named the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's team won the Rider Cup in 2018 and defeated the United States Team with a final result of 16.5 - 10.5 on the La Gulf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost up to now six times in a row on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again won the crown when Captain Thomas Bjorn's team arrived at the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Michaelson, who struggled for almost all the tournament, sent his bat from the 16th Tomb of Far Three, and lost the game against Francesco Molinari.
The brilliant Italian golf player in Malinari all around him became one of the four players who had arrived at 5-0-0 since the beginning of the current tournament in 1979.
American actor Jordan Speth was defeated 5 and 4 by the lowest-class actor on the European team, The Verbien Olsen of Denmark.
Destine Johnson, the world's first-place rebel player, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Fulter from England, which may be the last time he played the Ryder Cup.
With an eight-pack of participation in the Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergeo Garcia became a European player with the highest number of winnings in the tournaments with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry but today I can't hold back.
It's been a rough year.
So I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the cup back.
This is the team, and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia emotionally after the European victory.
He's moving the white torch of his country, John Ram, who defeated the American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in the single game on a day.
"The great pride I feel, defeat Tiger Woods, where I watched when I grew up," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost every four games in France and his record now stands at 13-21-3, when the Ryder Cup is in the career.
We're talking strange statistical data from one of the best players at all times, who won 14 important numbers, when he was only in the past of Nick Laus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find its way into law, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Pino, who played high-level golf for the whole tournament.
The U.S. team captain Jim Pyurrick spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Well done for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna reorganize, I'm gonna work with the American golf union and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
We need to take off the hat.
We've been defeated."
