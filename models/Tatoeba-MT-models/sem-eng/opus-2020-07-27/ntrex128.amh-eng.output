The Welsh EMs were afraid of ‘ living like the eyes ’
Some EMIs were distressed by the idea that their call should be to the M.M.P. (members of the Welsh Parliament).
The case was brought about by a plan to change the name of the group to the Welsh Parliament.
The MEMs in the political world are convinced that it can bring ridicule.
According to a Liberian MM, his group was afraid that he would be faced with the "tifleo and pedophilia".
To readers outside Wales, it means a fool in the Welsh Tidley, and it means a pedotype.
According to one Plyid MM, the group in general indicated "not happy" and options.
According to the Welsh fundamentalist, his group has a "receptive mind" about the change of name, but it is a brief vocabulary from the audio to the mite.
It is similar to the one in York's English alphabet.
As the Commission of the Party, which is now in the process of introducing similar changes, states: "The final decision of the members of the Committee is indeed his own. "
The Wills Law 2017 gave the Welsh Party the power to change its name.
In June, the Proposal, which was designed to call the party Welsh Parliament, issued a public consultation with broad support.
With regard to the EM case, the commission chose what was said by the Welsh Parliament or the DVDs, but the option was supported by public consultation by the client.
MMs are offering options for public change, but it may be a mascot to the current president, Eliine Jones, who is expected to submit the draft law within weeks.
The reforms include laws on the expulsion of EMs and the introduction of the committee system, including other changes in the way the Council operates.
When they argue on the law, they have the final voice on the question of who they should be called.
The Macedonians made a choice to change their homeland’s name at the time of their return
Sundays make a choice to call their country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia."
The public choice was to resolve the decade-long disagreement with neighboring Greece, in the state of Macedonia.
She repeatedly challenged her claim to be a member of Ew and NATO, reminding him that for a long time the name of her northern neighbor indicates a question about her state.
President George Ivanov, who is opposed to the choice of name change, stated that he is not interested in the choice.
However, Prime Minister Zoran Zayev says that the name change is easy to pay to become a member of Ew and NATO.
St. Martin’s bells were secure during the struggle of the Harlem churches
"I've talked with the heads of history in every corner of the Banabet and the Church," said Mr. Adam.
"Today none of them are."
They have explained that it can be understood that the banks are destroyed.
Today, he said, "People are doing social contact in a different way."
"Bunchhouses are no longer the local hotels where people go on a regular basis."
They fear that the money from the sale of property to the churches will be too small, "and fast and slow."
More recently, church buildings can be replaced by community buildings of people who do not help the rest of the local temples.
"The majority of people who buy common homes here will be white, "and therefore we will be quick to close the day when these churches will be closed at all because it is not expected that the majority of people who come to these common houses will become members of these churches."
Both churches were previously built by white groups, and in 1870 the city community, St. Martin, was ten years later.
The main group of white Methodists was released in the 1930s.
A recent black party has taken over the ownership of the building.
St. Martin was led by C. Howard Johnson, a group of traders on the 125th Street of Harlem, the main market for black people who had been caught up in the Black Cup.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged, but as Father Johnson planned to rebuild the laity, he was made up of an expensive musical instrument.
Priest David Johnson, Father Johnson's son, and St. Martin's successor, they called it "the poor's phone."
In the past, experts have called our musical instrument "cultural wealth" and "historical instrument" that does not replace it.
At the University of Michigan, its expert, Tifani Enji, also 18 years ago, was the first to play in the world’s most popular musical instrument of the Riverside Church, a black musician, Dioncio A. Lind.
According to Mr. Marywezer, Saint Martin did not replace him.
In the past few months, some of them have been carried out by St. Martin, others by church leaders, and others by the complex Architects and Contraceptors of the country.
Even the council of the church's leaders, which was founded on the body of the bishop, said that although the department did not participate in the process of hiring the goods and contractors that the state had sent the sermons, the country's press stated that it wanted to pass the fees on to the department.
Some believers complain that there is a problem of privacy in the country's sermon.
Asa, a 13 - year - old boy who was swimming in a lobster in California, suffered permanent damage
On Saturday, officials reported that on the opening day of Lobster, in California, Asa had been injured by a 13-year-old boy who had been swimming to me for a permanent lobster.
The damage occurred just before 7 a.m., near the coast of Incinitas on the Beken Sea.
Chad Hemel told KSWB-TV in Sandigo that they were talking to friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, just as they had heard when the boy screamed for help and lied to the boy to get some water.
At first, Hamel thought it was a pleasure to have a lobster, but they said that he was saying, "I was touched!"
'I'm touching you!'
All of this was opened, and Hamel said that they had noticed this immediately after they arrived with the boy.
"I screamed that everyone should get out of the water," he added.
In a dangerous situation, the child was taken by plane from Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego.
Asa, who was the victim of the accident, is not known for his permanent generation.
As the life-saving writer Katyn Larry Giles said in the media release a few weeks earlier, Asa had been on the scene a long time ago, but he was not a dangerous, permanent family of Asa.
Giles added that the victim suffered alarming damage to the upper part of his body.
Officials have shut down the coast for 48 hours from the coast of Ponto, Kazabald, to the city of Incinitas, which is located in Swamis for inspection and security purposes.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 long-lasting species of Asa in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Synsbery’s plans to enter the Yuque beauty markets
With professional support from the Sencebry staff, it has bots, Superdrigs and Debenhams, a large store of beautiful furniture organized in various locations.
As fashion and sales decline in the country, like the €2.8 billion pressure on the world market that continues to grow, the largest container terminals will be tested in 11 locations throughout the country, and if this is successful, they will be taken to more than the next year.
The supermarcs on the top of the beauty are once on the run when they save the platform for TVs, heat and furniture on charges.
Seinsbury stated that for the first time, it doubles its beauty supply to 3,000 products, including Rivlon, Essierman, and Dor.
Starting with Laurel, Mabelin and Burts's products, they will find the same more different places in Bund, with the same markets as Butes.
The Supermarc also recommences the use of the "Maktikn" to produce the most desirable products for young consumers, which are being so highly sought only by consumers.
Also, the cosmopolitan store of Vergrens also tries to cut down both of the Seinsbury shops, which was opened last week in South London, and the second at the end of this year in Birmingham, Selly Oak.
Online's purchase and purchase of small - sized foods every day means that supermarcs should do more to convince people to visit them.
According to the chief manager of the Seinsbari, Mike Kupei, in his attempt to lure Aldi and Liddell into less-than-food services and products, he looks like a large store in many parts of the super-market chain.
Seinsbury has set up hundreds of Argon's exits, and two chains have been introduced two years ago to a number of more profitable homes that have reinforced the sales of logs and made them more profitable.
The attempt by the Supermarctuary to reorganize beauty and doctoral homes in various parts of the past has failed.
In the early 2000 ’ s, Seinsbury had tried to start with a bus but had ended up breaking up with a disagreement about how to divide the income from the store in the supermarkets.
The new strategy came in after 281-gardard doctor sold his house three years ago to Selecio, the owner of a single home medical chain, in £125 million.
According to Lloyd Larosche-Possy and Vinchi, a gifted leather box will play a role in the project by adding four wide-ranging brands, including products such as Laroshe-Posie and Vinchi.
According to Seisbari's business director, Paul Mills-Hicks, "we have changed the shape and feelings of our beauty cards to raise our clients in the area.
We have also poured out money on specially trained colleagues who are ready to offer advice.
The brands we have are designed to be suitable for each of our needs, and they show us that we are a convincing source of beauty, which is now a challenge to our past form of shopping.
After 11 million agreements have been signed by Holly Willogby, Peter Jones is 'greatly angry'
In order to focus on a new contract with Dragens Den Johns, the TV offerer Holly Willogby, with Marks and Spencer and Etivy, he went 'greatly angry' after he made the 11 million agreements in his life with the business.
Willowby has nothing to do with furniture and changers.
The pioneer trade was linked to Gop Brand by Gwenez Paltrow.
According to Instagram, a 37-year-old woman who is an offerer of Zitz Morening announced that she was going out.
In order to focus on her new contract with Marks and Spencer and the ATI, Holly Wilogby got out of their commercial business at the last minute of their commercial business, leaving St. Peter Jones.
According to sources, at a tense meeting held at the headquarters of the Ministry of Commerce in Marlo, Beijing, the golden TV man would spend up to £1.5 million in gold and then turn around for them household goods and changers, while Jones was "greatly angry" when he said that she did not have time to use Brand Troliy.
The business was linked to Gop Brand by Gwenez Paltrow, and it was estimated that Willogbin's wealth had doubled to 11 million.
When 37-year-old Willogbe announced that she would be released by Instagram, Jones went to a vacation home from Britain in Jet.
According to one source, "Troulie Holly was one of your top priorities.
It was her long-term job, which she would spend for the next ten years.
The decision that she made alarmed everyone involved in the matter.
On Tuesday, no one was able to believe what was going on, and it was close to starting.
The warehouse in the main office in Marlo is filled with goods ready for sale.
The next morning's offer is one of Britain's leading bankers, who have expressed their belief that this man's departure would cost the money of Milien to his homemade organization, and thus cause further delays in his successive successful journey.
As a result, the long-standing partnership can end.
Wilogway and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to John and his wife, Tara Cap.
Willogway strengthened her relationship with Cap in 2016; 52-year-old John was chairman in March.
The Caples Holy Today and Jones have a 40 percent share in the Bald Win TV project.
Willowway will be the ambassador for M.S. Brand, and here you will replace Ann Mac Parthelin, the provider of I.V.A.A.
John's immediate sources said that they would not want to make any comments about what's least about him yesterday.
We both fell out of love after an interesting discussion.
Some have commented on the "not expected of the president" and have found it hard to criticize news outlets for thinking positive things about the North Korean leader.
Why do they have a lot of hard work?
Trump said, "This is the voice of the new reader."
"I don't give up on anything."
As he explained, he will be happy at the second meeting, and this meeting will be the first one held in Singapore in the month of June and will have a better chance of making North Korea's Nikolair without a country.
However, it is in a position to agree to do so.
This was three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, which was held at the United Nations Conference with various world leaders, the General Assembly of the North American countries stated that it did not pay attention to the "accompanied response" of the Northern American War Force to North Korea.
According to him, America has continued to fight against us in an attempt to force us on the contrary.
Trump's long speech touched on good things.
He said that we are getting along well with North Korea.
With North Korea, we were already leading to war.
Millions of people could have died.
We are now able to establish good relationships.
According to him, they have made a negative impression on their efforts to improve their relationship with Kim, and this will not be the case, including the launch of rockets,
They said that they disagree when they are asked if they have established the normal relationship with Kim.
Trump said that it would be easier to be president than to bring 10 thousand people into the public hall, and they would point out that there are now about 200 people in the hall.
Hundreds of people died from tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia.
In the aftermath of the Lumbok earthquake, non-governmental organizations in foreign countries were found to be in need of help.
Although about 10 percent of the people of La Bock have disappeared, no national danger has been reported.
As Mr. Sambang put it, "There is no demand for international help on many occasions, and this is very difficult."
When the Sev The Children were preparing a team to travel to Palu, there was no doubt about the need for foreign experts to come and set up.
My/R Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Emergency Emergency Egensy, stated that the authorities of Palau, Indonesia, were in a position to indicate that there was a possibility that international genetics could be established.
As Indonesia faces various times, the earthquake has become a sad failure.
Although in Ith Tsunami, in the course of the tsunami, tents have been hit hard on other shores, few are on the other side of the sea.
The lack of a tsunami warning in Palu has played a major role in the death of people, even though it has had little to do.
It wasn't easy to go back to one island in Indonesia even in good times.
Natural Disaster has made it even more interesting.
The ship in the Boak hospital, he said, was on the way to help the victims in Palu, but it would take at least three days to reach Palu.
President Jako Widodo had promised to improve Indonesian base development during elections, and this cost a lot of money on roads and rail.
However, the lack of individuals from FF was threatened by the M/Jaccon administration as an obstacle to the next year's elections.
Mr. Joko is being strengthened by another force, and a number of leading Muslims are becoming conservative.
In the streets, more than 1 000 people were killed by Christian and Muslim machetes, while 10,000 were disqualified from their remains, and they used them for fighting like a stupor, a bow, and other instruments.
Look at this: the Liverpool Daniel took the lead together, but I will not be able to do it.
On Saturday, Daniel Stitch was saved from placing a point in Premier by Gole Leverpolll, who was held in an 89-minute match with Stanford Bridge in London.
Girdan Shakari, who had arranged a 30-yard distance outside of the Chelcy district, was leading group 1 to 0.
He took the ball on his feet and hit it hard to reach the goal.
The experiment was successful, and the right-wing Corner died in a ball in the upper region.
The ball also landed on the network of Kipa Arezabalagan.
When Sturch told LeverpoolFC.com, we were trying to control the ball more and make it a goal, and players like Jacques were playing ahead.
When Kantti came to me, I only touched her ball once.
The Belgium Star of Eden was leading 1 to 0 in the middle of the game, which was held by Gol, which took the 25th minute.
The blue crowd was watching a ball for Matthew Avachi back in this game.
Kovachi quickly gave up her ball and returned to the average.

It has become a good memory for the history of Parliament.
A number of traditional and ethnic English gifts, which the Taliban have praised and given to the Persians, are not worth considering.
The Creek Society of the Croatian Wells describes it as trying to reword history.
According to John Gold Smith of the Cromwell Society, the present debate is about to pick up an image of the Oliver Commonwealth, which stands outside the West Minister's palace.
The English civil war, which many do not accept, was not ordered by Rome, nor was it organized.
Cromwell's weakness could be attributed to paying for the work of Thomas before him.
The way Sir William H. Cromwell described the 19th-century evidence, as well as the story, has brought many to the fore.
Mr. Gold Smith said to the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is respected by the Barkets, and especially in the 19th century was more respected than ever, by resisting outside pressure from parliament, especially from the royal family.
It continues to be a historic debate on what will be fully settled.
Of course, the mid - 17th-century conflict took shape rather than the further development of our country, and Cromwell was known to represent one facet of that division.
The successes are as glorious and as memorable as a king on the throne.
The killer's pig attacked a Chinese Marshal.
According to the local media, a farmer in a southwestern China market was killed in a dramatic attack.
According to Morning Post, in South China on Sunday, Uan, a man in the state of Guisshou, reported that he was found in a blood transfusion and died.
In Zung Kingway Province, China, May 30, 2005, Arso, the owner of the Sami, was ready to strike the pigs' vaccine.
Last Friday he and his cousin brought 15 pigs to the market from the province of Yuan.
The next morning, his cousin was found dead, and the door of his neighbor's Samas's house was opened.
According to him, the big pig had changed his mouth in blood.
Forensic analysis found that 550 pounds of pigs were responsible for the Russian invasion, according to the report.
"My cousin's throat was transfused with blood and was damaged" was called "Wu" by the victim as he was described by Goliang Ivanning News.
Yuan Hüms showed in the remaining pictures of security cameras that he was entering the market to feed the pigs 4.40 am.
The body was found an hour later.
He killed the man because he did not have any children or his uncle's son.
According to one police officer, he was arrested for not harming others by the pigs, and the police added that he was gathering information.
Yuan's families and marketers are talking about the level of compensation for the loss of her.
Even though there have been occasions when pigs have attacked people in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man great harm.
10 years ago, a lion weighing 650 pounds had stuck a Welsh farmer to the tractor until his wife threatened to drive the animal away.
In 2012, until an origo farmer eats the pigs, a mannotoba farmer told the Sibicy news that pigs are not usually aggressive, but he may be "smoking" with blood.
"They're playing."
They're like a child, they're asking too much... they're not going to hurt him.
Only to give proper respect, he said.
Roza hurricanes bring large and heavy rains to southwestern Yugoslavia
As predicted, the rosa storm is falling on the cold water of northern Mexico.
However, in the days that follow, Rosa brings torrential rains in northern Mexico and southwestern Yugoslavia.
Roza had 85 miles an hour wind, 1 hurricane, from 5 a.m. on Sunday morning, and from southwestern Mexico, Punta Eugeni, and 385 miles.
Sunday Rosa is expected to travel north.
Meanwhile, it is beginning to take shape on the peaceful ocean and move to the east coast of the U.S. West.
On Monday, Rosa brings rain to a section of Mexico's 10-inch.
Then, as the tropical moisture comes in contact with the crevice that is coming, it brings heavy rains to the south-west for the next day.
The 1 to 4 Inch rains in the area could lead to dangerous floods, earthquakes and desert landslides.
Deep tropical humidity, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, results in rain levels of approximately 2-3 % per hour.
In particular, the region of Arizona is expected to have rain from 2 to 4 inch.
It could occur in a flood that is rapidly decreasing by a scattered rain of rain.
It is not very wise to go to the desert on foot when there is a threat of tropical rain.
The heavy rain valleys make strong rivers, causing thunders to bring powerful winds and dusts in the area.
The approaching garage brings some environmental rain on the southern coasts of California.
More than half of the total rain could cause a low level of rain and road traffic.
This may be the first rain of the local wet season.
Before the rain begins to expand on Mondays and Tuesdays, some scattered tropical raindrops will start approaching Arizona on Sundays and Monday mornings.
A heavy rain is spreading on all four fronts from Tuesday to Morocco.
As the Arctic cools, there may be some strong temperature changes across the USS in October, but Tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this brings unexpected changes to heat in a short distance.
Unforeseen heat differences are a major example on Sunday in Central USA.
From Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, there is a close to 20 degrees of heat between the two.
In the next few days, the summer heat will try to expand again.
It is expected that the majority of Central and Eastern USs will have a hot spring for October, which will extend from the southern plains to the north-east.
On Tuesday, New York City can reach 80 degrees, an estimated 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our prolonged weather forecast shows that in October, the first half of the U.S. is more likely to be hotter than the average.
More than 20 million people have seen the Court of Light Cavanah.
More than 20 million people have seen a spectacular witness on a sex TV net on the television screen of the White Cavanakh Supreme Court and a woman accused of sexual assault in the 1980 ’ s by Christine Blessey Ford.
In the meantime, the political opposition continued, and for the last minute, Brckensters have interrupted their regular schedule for the last minute: FBI has signed a one-week review of the charges.
Ford said she was convinced that at a high-school party for the Senate Justice Committee, Kavanah was accompanied by her and tried to get her out of her clothes.
Kavanah said that he was convinced that their emotional testimony had not occurred in a hundred percent.
The report stated that Nelson may have seen more than 20.4 million people.
The company was counting the average audiences of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News canal and Fox Business Network and MMNB.
The number of other Networks, including PBCS, CSPAN and the Fox Business Network, was not immediately removed.
And Nelson's office often has some difficulty measuring those who see him as an office.
In order to bring this into a certain perspective, the audience has the same size as a soccer game or an academic prize.
Fox News Canal, who strongly supported the Kavanakh election, said that during a trial that took place all day, 5.69 million average viewers were leading all the Netwarts.
ABC was the second in 3.26 million viewers.
CBC 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MMNB 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
After the trial, he continued to have a high level of interest.
Felix was a central figure in the Saturday drama.
On Friday morning, when the Republican Bureau issued a statement of its approval for Kavana'k, the cameras were installed in CEN and Cebices cameras as they tried to arrest the opposition to go to trial.
In the face of opposition, it has been transmitted directly by the CNN, as they have stood by their necks on the ground for many minutes.
“ I’m standing right in front of you ”
Do they think that they are telling the truth to the country?
"Many women have no power, but you have power," they said.
According to Flick, the office has issued a statement and can speak more during the committee trial before the transfer is closed.
When the Justice Committee voted for the full vote of the Kavanakh election, the cable and the Broadcast Networks were all covered by direct distribution.
But he said that he could do this only by realizing that he will see the accusation made on the candidate the following week, as was true of a few democracys.
Fleak admitted in part after talking to his friend, the Democratic Senator, Chris Kuns.
After talking to Cons and several senators, Flex made their decision.
Flex's choice has power, because the republics will certainly not have the voice needed to destroy the Cavanac outside of the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation of the Kavanah charges.
British Prime Minister May Hayyan is charged with "playing politics" above the Secretary-General.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May alleged that he was taking with him the plan to break up a European union, as the British interests and national interests were being eroded, and that he was taking up "a game of politics".

In the past he recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 points in one game.
On Friday morning, Elsio's basketball coach Will Weid said that the group was on "high hit" and "in shock".
"That's what you're always worried about," says Wade.
The volcano sheds ashes in Mexico City
The ashes from the popocateptal volcano reached the camps of Mexico's capital and southern dwellings.
On Saturday, the National Emergency Centre warned the Mexicans to stay away from the area after the volcanic eruption began and announced that in 24 hours it had registered 183 gas mines.
The centre was in the midst of a lot of noises and earthquakes.
Images from the social media showed that the ashes were covered by car covers in Mexican City camps, such as Zochimil.

Forty-four people have suffered minor injuries, according to the local newspaper.
The situation in the area of free search continues to be very tense after the October 1 Rifford was taken as a law in Madrid but celebrated by the activists.
Although the number of people who have heard the voices of those who oppose the launch has been lower than the number of people who have made a big crowd, the electors have chosen to be very free.
According to Catalan officials, over the past year, nearly 1,000 people were injured in a violent conflict throughout the region to stop the sound of election stations.
They spent the evening to defend the campaign with the support of the National Police on Friday.
The protest was fought, but it took a different way.
The 68-year-old Narciss Termes Catalonia, who, along with his wife, took part in the campaign, claimed that they no longer had the hope of gaining freedom.
"We have spent one of our best times last year.
I saw my parents reading with joy, but now we stand," he said.
Although in the past it has been useful for environmental choices to be registered as a narrow victory, most parties promoting Catalan are not able to protect the freedom that they were waiting for in prison for because of their known leaders or their own persecution or their role in the review and subsequent Declaration of Freedom.
According to 42-year-old Mechanic Huan Puig, who was preparing for the police campaign, the conflict was fought by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial prisons since last year, Oriol Huanquaras announced that next year he would run for election to the European Parliament.
"We can see from the Spanish government that participating in European elections helps to observe and understand the pressures of democracy when they are lacking," he said.

Previously, Reinger was a leader of the European League in Raped Vena in the field.

The Holtz group must use their own resources to spread their differences without delay.
Scott Robinson turned his face to Goliath in a great attack, and it was observed that Allan was just trying to launch him into the Carrig Hakets to receive comfortable front-stools.
The concern of the M.M. team was that the guest group could be disturbed as the Rangers played with them.
The role of adult behaviour has never been lost.
As the Rangers receive a total punishment, Living Stone, strengthened by DeKlan Gallagher and Robinson, together, has changed from the field to the beauty of the ball they have received.
Over the years, Rangers have been infected with ball control, but they have been able to protect themselves, and the goal has been greater than that of the guardian, Yam Kali.
Although things continued this way, Alfredo Morelos used Heil on Kelly.
Scott Pitman has been a victim of damage to the Ringer target, while Allan McGerger and Liggaw have been in conflict with those who have been involved with the Living Stone.
When the Livingston district was re-empted, easily invaded, and the Haquets, who had changed Glendton, he was in a position of double punishment, especially one on his hands.

Livingston’s Historical Qualification and Results
The precautions for human relations, which prevent people from leaving their homes, are very impressive.
Their style and activity have not changed much, especially after they came to the lead, but the motivation of the team, which was combined with the group, is highly appreciated.
He has many heroes.
The Amadul Halkat was a giant and was a successful organizer, in other words, Manga Conner Goldsson and Joy Warrell.
The Rangers had been motivated by the games.
Although they were good at Gerard's time, they had low success in terms of the Standards.
The fact that their final balls are not effective after they have been created, when there are no problems, makes it easier to think about the group at the center of the board.
Ordogan had a special reception for me.
On Saturday (September 29), when Turkish and German leaders attended the breakfast in Berlin, a clear sky appeared and many were delighted.

Hundreds of Erdogan opponents have been heard to speak out, including those who were content with the Cardiish voice, who were condemning Erdogan's policies, and Germany's decision to accept the man.
The strong opposition is the difference between those who have German-Turk citizenship and those who criticize visitors like a hero and a dictator.

The famous Ruza storm can damage the city of Ponux, Lasvegas, and Salt Lake, but they can be used in drought-stricken areas.

According to one authority on Sunday, Salawezi, one of Indonesia’s islands, followed by tsunamis, and at least 384 people who were killed by massive storms and left behind.
In the city of Palu, when hundreds of people settled on a beach peteval, a wave of six feet or 18 feet [6 m] in height was the result of all that they could find, including those who could relax while still in the dark of the storm.
Following a tsunami in the area, 7.5 per cent of the earthquake occurred.
"At the time of the threat of tsunamis, the content of satisfactions were on the beach, and they were not trying to escape.
"The prince did not come by himself, cars, logs, houses, hit everything on the ground, "Nogoho said, "This is not just a tsunami before striking the coast, traveling at 800 km (497 mills in a season) on the entire ocean.
A few people have been able to escape the tsunami by climbing a tree, says:
Some 16,700 people were taken to 24 Palu stations.
According to aerial photographs of the disaster, many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were broken, and a bridge was surrounded by water:
On Saturday, a light earthquake continues to shake the city:
A series of earthquakes were heard in an area of 2.4 million people:
Indonesia's idea of technology and appliance was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb that was dropped in Hiroshima during the second world war, which caused the Arab earthquake.
The city’s position in a long and narrow ocean has made the tsunami more powerful, he said.
According to Nugoho, the damage was "expected" and this resulted in thousands of rented homes, hospitals, and shops:
The victim said that the remains of the victims were found in ruins of buildings, including 540 wounded and 29 destroyed.
According to Nugarho, the death and destruction of the 300 km (190 miles) coast of Palu in the north of Donggala can increase, and the area is close to the capital of the earthquake.
Communication Tools are out of work, so no information can change from the area of Hong Kong, says Nugoho2.
According to a Red Cross statement, more than 300,000 people live in the area, "including the employees of the organization and the prosthetics."
He said: "This is a sad giant, but it can go a long way."
In spite of the authorities' warning, the wave had reached earlier.

Within minutes, a tower came from the beach to carry cars and buildings
Rothers could not retrieve the video image immediately:
The earthquake has made rescue work difficult by using the power lines in the area of Palu.
From Jakarta and other cities, the army is delivering relief supplies by plane, as authorities have, but they desperately want food and other building assistance.

The city’s air route has been reopened for an urgent time, but it will remain out of the way until October:
Indonesia's tsunami will be more than 800 deaths.

"Many homes have told me they're useless," he said.
It's very bad.
When aid workers went up to start their civil service, they also complained that some highly experienced foreigners were forbidden to travel to Palau.
Under the Indonesian law, foreign aid can come in the wake of a national disaster.
This has not yet been done.
"So well known is the danger of one state, " said an Indonesian red cross spokesman Iulia Ariani.
"If the government shows it, that means that if it is declared as a national disaster, we will be able to make ourselves open to help, but we will not say anything."

Mexico’s Emilo promised not to use Heil against the people
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, promised that the same would not be fought by religion in his speech on 50 Memorials of the brutal and brutal attacks on students.
López Obrador's speech in the Lattelolco newspaper on Saturday is that "they don't use the military Hill to destroy Mexican citizens."
In the same courtyard, on October 2 1968, nearly 300 people were killed in a peaceful conflict when the Latin American regime began to be persecuted.
Lopez Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by giving his education to a monthly scholarship at the university and by opening up more free public universities.
Employment and education institutions have also said that youth are leading to organized crime.
The American Intelligence Agency must double its financial support to an artificial intelligence
Since China is strengthening its participation in the artefacts, U.S. research and research teams report that they should allocate twice as much money as they currently spend on Google, microsoft, and Apple companies, including the Invester and the Artistic Intelligence Expert
The comment was followed by the release of AIA ads by various American government bodies, and the country is even more prominent as an artificial intelligence strategy.
However, China has announced its last meal in 2030 to be "1" in the Field of Artistic Intelligence.
“When other countries are left behind for food, twice as much as a good start is being made, we’re working to bring about a change, as Lee 2 says.
In an interview with CBC this week, Lee said that he had twice raised his financial support, making it the next U.S. discovery.[2]
Lee’s book on the Artistic Intelligence Supervisory of China, Silicon Valina New World Order, published this month by Hogton Mifflin Harcort, a leading Chinese executive of the Science Ventures Company, which is one of the most famous of the Chinese, Face++.
In the 1980 ’ s, at Carnegie Mellen University, he founded a system of artefacts, which was the highest in the Americas, and then served as a research and research operator for the Chinese Google branch.
As noted by L.E., the old U.S. government, such as defens Adphased Research Project, calls for similar competitions to be held in order to distinguish the next generation
Researchers in the United States have found that they need to work hard to overcome government finances:
"China isn't China. She's not taking the Corporette leaders. The companies are the ones," he said.
Fes Book, Google and Microcomputers have taken prospective students to work on the military intelligence.
According to Leigh, the change of the immigration police will make a major contribution to China's military intelligence efforts.
"I think it's time for Green to get a card ready for the students working in the Artistic Intelligences PH.
The program was launched in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Centre supports education institutions, which means that, like the National Science Foundation and the Lylo Government Foundations, they spend money on researchers in the Americas, but that the quality of Chinese education is low, says Lee.
At the beginning of this event, the American Department of Defence established the Joint Industrial Intelligence Centre, which allows industry and education to participate, and in the same way the White House has promoted the establishment of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
And this month he announced a $2 billion assignment for the DIA project.]

The Macedonians voted publicly on whether or not the name of the country would be changed
Last Sunday, the Macedonians voted to determine the country's Republic of North Macedonia or not, which, it is believed, would have solved the marriage of the country to the European Union and NATO.
Similarly, Greece, which has a territory called Macedonia, has used the name of the country to restrict its right to vote in order to prevent it from becoming a member of the Netham or the European Union.
Although the two countries have reached agreement on this name in June, they have been challenged by national opponents, who claim that the majority of the Macedonian Slavic people are less likely to be identified.
As President Georgi Ivanov said that he would not vote in his statement, since there was a similar unaccompanied campaign, the decision made that the public was concerned that 50 per cent of the population would be able to obtain what was needed by Kkiss:
The question on the voice sheet reads: "They choose to marry the Greek people and join the NATO and the European Union."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that it is worth paying for the future membership of the Macedonian Union of NATO and Europe, which has broken down the public decision.
"I came here today to choose my better country for tomorrow; especially among the young people in Macedonia, there will be freedom in the European Union, because this will make life easier for all of us."
Although not legally, they have stated that a sufficient number of members of parliament are willing and willing to accept it as a matter of urgency.
To make the change of name practical, two thirds of the members of Parliament must have a voice.
The National Election Commission's 1 p.m. polling problem did not occur.
The election was held by 16 percent, but last year 34 percent of the vote was voted out by 66 percent.
"I came to give a voice because of my children. My home is Europe."
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zayev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, made their voices on the 30th anniversary of the change in the name of the country on the 30th day of the year 2018, which helped to unite NATO and the European Union.
In Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardrov's tent was set up in front of the Parliament to form a small platform and hold our seats in front of the tent.
"We are with the Union of NATO and Europe, but when we mix up, we set our neck, not as a low-utilization for others," said Kovadakov.
"We are a poor country, but we have honor."
If we do not accept as Macedonians, we will mix with the Euro-Eshyan union by turning our faces to China and Russia ”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership of NATO brings great investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
According to Zayve, after sounding, “more than 80 percent of our citizens believe that they support Europe and NATO”
According to him, "Yes" is an assurance of the time to come."
According to a public opinion published last Monday by the Macedonian Police Research Institute, between 30 and 43 percent of the electorate participated in the refrandous, and this showed that they did not vote.
According to another public opinion of the Macedonian TV, 57 percent of the participants in the study were willing to vote on the next Sunday.
70 percent of the respondents said yes.
To be successful, Rivrandu has to have one voice when 50 percent of the response is combined.
The fall of Rivrandu shows that the Western government’s policy for the first time since May last year has been in decline.
Consider: Manchester City was worried about the Bryton’s defenses to make it as great as Mnchester’s Aguerro

Aguerro was following a 61-minute tour of Golgotia when he expressed his joy as a fool.
As of the beginning of Argentina's violent game, he had been given a nice ball from his parents.
He was running with three Bryton's defenses before he was thrown into hiding.

"In November we were all following you.
Five weeks have passed since the most important choice was made in our lives.

As Trump continues, "Look at this fear-of-the-threshold democracy group, take note of what's happening.
They are also trying to gain power by using whatever means are available to them.
"They don't have to have anyone to harm them until they get in their hands. They want to take power and control. We don't give them."

I was surprised to find that many of my fellow inmates were unrecognized
I'm better at telling the truth about the Lord's MPs, but I'm not accepted.

Because I did not agree with German Corbin, I have been a victim of a campaign of hate.

"We want to be involved and productive, as the Nottingham East Labourt held last Friday."
After I had been eight years in Laber MP, I was elected for the Friday evening GC meeting.
Today, it may not be the sound of many meetings in a sad way, and it has been a long time since the “good people, young people” and politics had started again.
The Liber party has increasingly rejected different ideas, and only if they are accepted by the party leaders will they accept.
This began after a period of German leadership, and I thought in advance that while I was with him, I could have the authority to accept and support the right political opinion, that is to say, by agreeing on national security or even on the single market of Europe.
When I speak in front of the public, what I say is no problem; the disturbing information is presented in the social media, and those who oppose politics and say I don't have to go on at the Labour Party.
And this is not my experience.
Of course, I believe that I am better off than my friends because the opinions that come to me are political.
I am grateful to my colleagues for their skills, as well as for their heavy daily sexual and racial attacks and for the unresisted.
Political violence is a common phenomenon.
Last week the German Corbin indicated that the Labour Party should develop a culture of patience.
The reality is that there is no larger church, and it also makes the party more vulnerable to changing the law of choice without trust in each other.
“ I now have the advice to humble myself in the past two years and not to become a big adult ”
But I didn’t bring that into politics
As I joined Labourne 32 years ago, with the motivation of the Church, I thought that I could become the minister of a local consul and a government minister to serve with satisfaction in the public service when my overall educational outcomes began to decline.
I did not hide my political opinion, including my past choice.
No one in the West of Nottingham has been confused by my political position and disagrees with the current leaders.
I couldn't take it for granted at the time of the Bryzia and waste money, knowing that on the basis of my loyalty to the Lebour Party, I would like to support the Friday Mossey, which is going to affect the country's living conditions, even worse, and public service.
I have one message: not to stop the Notinham movement, but also the government. This looks at the Laber party and the other: I feel proud to be able to continue to serve, and it doesn't prevent me from fulfilling your wishes and believing whatever I promise, whatever threats or political conveniences I can.

Ayr 38 - 17 milligrams, unripe
The two who were delayed are close to completion, but Ayr will no doubt complete his athletic premiership contest.
By not winning ten games, they are leading the board as a band.
Finally, the strong defense department, as well as the audience, helped them to win the field's best opportunity, following which trainer Peter Murchie was delighted.
He said, "We've been tested in many games, and we haven't won a game. I'm happy."
"Thank you Ayr, but they're better than we are."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute experiment changed into a Major's climate and led Ayr, but he won the top of the yellow card servers that were given to Scotlando Abel Rory Hugugs, where he was able to move better and that Jason could not be a target.
At the end of the middle of the game, the goal confirmed by Ayr's leadership was confirmed by the penalty, and by its further self-sustaining efforts, it was a total success of 17-5 for the Ayr group.
Melros started well in the middle of the second half, and Patrick Anderson changed and expanded to only five.
After a long-standing severe injury to Ruardy Nott, followed from the first time that Ayr was out of the game, he was led by the Klimmo in Staford McDowell, where he was led by Staford McDowell.
When a well-functioning Ayr Amber Blair Maperson yellow card was shown, Melros changed the pressure of the game to the point where he was about to go.

In the 19th century, when the sea gate was still on the rise in Bolivia’s largest blood supply, the memory of the shoreline of the sea has shown a desire to catch the Pacific Ocean in Chile.
Bolivia October 1 of the International Court of Justice has been a high level of hope for more than ten years before it filed a five-year sentence with the International Court of Justice.
"Bolivia must see the change that comes with strength, spirit, and stress, free of stress," says Bolivia's diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.

The United Nations Secretary-General, like America, has come up with his comments. Three months after Kim John Un, leader of North Korea, in Singapore, is starting to start a new era of Nikeler diplomacy, which has now been forgotten.
According to Ray, continuing the ban is a 'miguous dream'; moreover, the fact that the war has ended does not affect North Korea because the United States does not want to accept it.

John Edward: Language skills for international citizens are useful.
Personal schools in Scotland have been able to record the most significant educational achievements in 2018, which has been achieved by building a strong work for individuals and groups in sports, art, music and other community-based activities.
Schools in Scotland, with more than 30,000 students, were represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, who tried to provide the best services for students and parents.
The private schools are working with the aim of encouraging their students to choose further higher education as citizens.
As a curriculum, and as a learning expert, modern languages have become the preferred subjects in schools, including their fame.
Nelson Mandela says: "When you talk to the language speaker, it is his ability to understand.
When you speak with the language speaker, let him have one mind."
It is worth noting that we should not simply be in English to establish contact with other nations and to create faith.
In the private schools, languages that can be understood as a result of this year are now at a high point on the basis of the English chart.
Of the students, 68 percent have come from abroad, A.A.
The data collected from SCIS and 74 members of schools showed that 72 percent of the most successful A were Mandarin, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland believe that foreign languages are useful for children and young people’s future.
At present, it is teaching the private school system and other languages, such as STEM subjects (scientific, technology, engineering and education).
The study found that 17 percent of the employees found that language problems were the main cause of their difficulty in filling out job advertisements, according to a survey conducted by the UK Staff Wall and Skills Commission.
Thus, the fact that young people have a lot of language skills is very useful for their future careers.
For most job opportunities in the Lutheran world, language skills are useful.
The person's choice is, not the perspective of the field of employment, but the right to live with the second language learners.
People who speak many languages to communicate directly with foreign citizens win the race.
According to Yugoslavia, in 2013, over 4000 young people in the United Kingdom chose to participate, 75 percent of them were not able to speak foreign languages in order to communicate with others, and they were the only language spoken in French with two percent (15 percent).
To that end, spending money on teaching the children’s language now is very useful.
Making many languages possible, especially for children whose economy is developing, gives them a job opportunity that has further meaning.
In Scotland, there is a difference in the language of each school.
A number of schools teach the United Kingdom language to be of great value in modern languages, and others, such as Mandarin or Japan, think of the time ahead 2020.
No matter what your son's wishes are, no matter how much he or she wants to learn in private schools, he or she will also be helped by experts who have made the most of his or her own language.
The private schools of Scotland are working with a determination to prepare children for future success and to create a learning environment that will enable them to do so.
In the global Bisnes region, language is very useful for the future of the country, so it should not be forgotten that it should be included in school at this time.
Indeed, so-called modern languages should pay attention to "international skills".
Personal schools continue to be selective for Scottish youths.
The fruit ben la faire.
John Edward is the director of the private schools of the Scottish private schools.

Rider 2018 is a Sunday occasion for the American Tim's show to give hope to a life of play
After a three-party race, the competition between four people on Saturday seems to be among the ones that need to be included in the Rider's race.
It is the result of a sports theory that fills the game of João: a playwright believes in such games as the "Balley" :
So when do they say that the height is right now?
"They were on six points, and now at four, so I'm guessing that we're just taking it as a little height," he was walking slowly.
Europe has a better advantage, and I have made it a game for it.
Americans feel that they have a very small share, as Spain says, even though they have a greater chance of strengthening, especially than those who play together all day long, such as Spain and Justin Thomas, say every day to get a four-six point.
Spain is a murderer, and it is an example of him leading from Ti to Green.
As the season of Su increased, he and Thomas were forced to go down the fourth, with the use of the most critical and effective tools, which they did after the second.
The attempt to win the 15th poem was similarly surprised, and this is what convinces you that the American team is not out of control.
"Yes, you should look into it and worry about your play," says Seppies.
This is the main thing that every conversationer has neglected.
18 Tears That Are Marked
In the past two years, Francisco Molinary and Tommy Filiwood have been the single most important players in Spain and Thomas, and this is an outstanding story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's mystery, however, is a popular pair of fours, and they don't get tired of it.
"Moliwood" on Saturday was a pair that was the only one that could not be picked up in a single pit; they were likewise kept from being considered a single target on Saturday morning.
All this race, which was published to all its supporters and supporters, seemed to them that they would win the song on Sunday, and that the cause of it was more likely than the Golf Nashnachnán and Filitwood, to be able to defeat the Europeans.
In a very selective way, both of them were in a different hole.
Although it is not always possible to talk about the respect of the Europeans.
Buba Watson and Simson have done a little work on Sergio Garcia, one of the morning’s two pairs, and he has joined Alex Knorr.
The Spanish and Swedish people have come to see one of the pits that they have never set in front of them before and have given them two goals before.
On Sunday, though no one can help, get yourself out of your pit.
Two-and-four-year games are so exciting to see close, and the reasons are to see how they can change the harmony, consultation, consultation, and speed change.
Europe still plays better as a team, and at the end of the day, it became a major leader, but as it showed four-four games, Tim America wanted to play, even though there were doubts on the part of the Stateside.
By results of 10-6, Europe ran to the end of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a healthy preference to finish the Ryder Cup, leading the Americas in 10-6, from Saturdays to four-year-olds.
The triggers enabled Timoti Flytwood and Francisco Molinary to raise four national lines, one leading us as the leader of the other Golf.
Thomas Byjourn's Europeans, in order to avoid the bowl they lost two years ago, they have been able to take 3-1 in the list, taking advantage of America when they were fired out of the eye in the morning game.
America has been better able to cope with the four-pronged game, won two games, but they have not been able to feed as much as possible.
Jim Fürk wants eight points of the Sunday 12s to keep the cups out
Fletwood is the new son of the Europeans. He and Molinary, Molywood, who have been called by the name of the wall, and who have followed the happy weekend of the Rider's story.
In the course of the match, a crowd of Buddhists and Patricks went on to beat up their Heidon, which was blown in a wonderful way, and to beat the American new boy Brissun, the United States’s new son, and the famous 5 &4 in the largest and most significant way.
In the Saturday games, HIV has moved to two games, and has met with the usual qualifications, 19 out of 29 games have been won with a double, four-four, and a series of seven.
Justin Rose, who has given a break to the two-twelf race, has returned to four games with his friend Henryk Stenson, won Dustin Johnson and Brook Coyepan – the world's 1st and 3rd.
Although in Western Paris, what did Europe find?
On Saturday, third-time winner Jordan Speis and Justin Thomas set an example for the Americans.
In a single game, John Rahw and Ayan found a reflection on the Walter in Spain, and then they were able to win the 4 & 3 Polter and Rory McCreen in four-four games.]
Even though he wants to keep the ball out of Fürrick, one of the four points of failure to get back to the single game team is only two times in the Rider Cup's history.
Two cans are a second choice, but it seems that the attack of the Sundays is beyond their ability.
North Korea says she won’t be released by an unbelievably “war ”
According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, on Saturday the continuing conflict with the Americas was deepening its mistrust and, as a result, there was no way for the National Forces to leave their weapons unbundled.
According to Yong Ho, the General Council of the World Foundation has taken the good action of North Korea in the past, for example, the cessation of the nuclear and Mishael tests, the collapse of the testing site, and the failure of New York to accept it.
"But we didn't find a corresponding response from the Americas," he said.
"We can't trust our national security without any kind of belief in America, and we can't set up a single army before such a situation."
When Rim also complained about the same common North Korea, he said that she refused to leave the nuclear weapons in progress and refused to accept Washington’s offer for her fair prize in North Korea, which made it seem necessary for him to abandon the independent nuclear campaign of the past.
Rey, in Kim John U and Tromp, said that when Kim promised to release a Korean thief from New York, the Trump would provide security for North Korea, he had to go to Singapore for the first time, the president of the United States and North Korea.
North Korea wants an official end to the 1950-53 war, and America has to put ahead of New Zealand's regime.
Washington also protested the call to reverse the non-contraception in North Korea.
"America first asks for "the destruction of the Nuclear Forces", and uses pressure to force her into entering it, "and even resists a declaration to stop the war," says Rie.
"It is an unsuccessful dream and a deaf people who don't know us.
The problem was a deep blow to the trust we had in ourselves.
Rey has not mentioned anything about the United States leader, since there is a Trompna meeting between the two of the Kims.
The Minister, in particular, drew attention to the three meetings held in the past five months between Kim and Mon Jin, the leader of South Korea, and added: "It would not have been difficult for a South Korean soldier to release from New York from Korea the Korean tribe. "
Although Ri's voice is very different from that of the past, as he spoke to the co-counsel states, it was only after the North Korean "Mir Evil President" Trump Kim said "My Rocket Man".
Just as Trump did not threaten North Korea "to destroy " whole-time, he was impressed by the action being taken to resolve the fighting, but said that a number of jobs are still in place and that North Korea must continue to destroy New Zealand.
"If it takes two years, three months, or five months."
China and Russia are getting involved in the United Nations.
But according to the U.S. Security Council Chief Secretary Mike Pompey for the United Nations, on Thursday the Security Council said: "The Security Council's suspension of the security council must continue and continue until the process results."
Since 2006, the Security Council has secretly prevented Pyongyang from breaking down the financial support to the Pyongyang of Nikuler and Bassiel in the Baltic.
Pompio met with Rein, who is on the side of the European Union.
Pompio Semen visited Korea for the third time this year alone, but the third visit did not produce the expected results.
When Pyongyang was released in July, it was explained that they were organizing the change within hours.
This month, at a meeting with the Moon, North Korea reported that it had to take "a similar action" in order to destroy its stations and the city of Niculere.
Kim, who said that he wanted to ensure their safety, said that he wanted to make sure that they had taken promises in Singapore to improve their relationship with Washington.
Harvard students took lessons about getting enough rest.
This year it has been shown that all the Under-Graz students at Harvard University have been trained to get enough sleep and to use 'the night with a lot of cuffs' to stop the study experience.
The world’s number of highly educated students in the world is said to be low in understanding of the basics and how the students see themselves.
In Harvard, a professor of sleep therapy and a specialist at Birmingham and the Women's Hospital, Charles Essler prepared a course that he believed was unique in America at a women's hospital.
Sleeplessness has moved him to start training on the impact of education.
"In the end a certain woman came to me, saying, 'Why was he now told to me? Why didn't he tell me earlier years?'
When she told her about the benefits of her bed, Asa said that he was surprised.
The first course, which was given for the first time, reveals to students that a good night’s sleep can help them to improve the quality of their education and the quality of their life and to maintain their health as a whole.
According to Paul Barrera, director of the University Health Service at Harvard School, he decided to introduce the course after searching for and finding students with severe sleep problems during the week.
The hourly training is accompanied by a lot of activities.
In one section, students' camp, with coffee teeth, curtains, coaches, and a cupboard, as well as the technical skills that follow the lack of sleep, and the regular observance of bedtimes.
Participants in the other section are told that prolonged sleeplessness increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, stress and cancer.
The training participants encourage them to think about their skills in an open way.
We know that student behavior doesn't change right away.
We believe that they have a right to know, just as you have the right to know about the health impact of smoking, so President Sessel has added:
There is still a culture of pride in spending the night sleepless: the use of modern technology, as he says, and the growing lack of sleep following pressure on students.
Be assured that you will get enough sleep, and this is a secret tool for learners to stop anxiety, fatigue, and anxiety.
19-year-old California studies chemical and physical biology and assisted Professor Seissler, who last year passed the course one day after the first year at Harvard University.
The course told him that he had told him to make himself known and to encourage him to take other courses in the building.
Next, he hoped that all students of the police should be told that they should follow suit and that they should complete training before going to the competitions.
Professor Chessler advises that students should be used to go to bed and to get up, and that they should know that blue lights from electronic screens and LEDs are harmful and that this can also lead to heart failure and sleep problems.
Living Stone 1-0 Rangers: The Minga target has been disappointed by the Gerard's players.
Reinders have been caught up in a defeat, and this is why the Stephen Gerard's group, under attack by Dolly Menga, has suffered a 1 to 0 failure in Livington.
Since the success of the 4-1 win in Sangton La, Ibrox has not tried to register their first victory, but the Gary Holtz Group has failed. GERRARD has destroyed its second eight-point leadership campaign in 18 games.
Mengae was tired of the first half of the minutes left, and Rangers were well motivated to play the field.
Now that the Rangers are on the sixth floor, Living Stones are on the third floor in Haiti.
It is expected that there may be another riot in the Ringer Department, and if there is a line conversation, Spain has been thrown from another direction and has damaged its head.
Gerard made an eight-word change in half of my career and in a game where Ayr was out of the race.
In another way, Holt, along with Levi 11 last week, is happy to be able to win Harts, and to worry about their rivals in all games.
Rangers were better controlled by the ball, but Living Stones were also seen doing better with the ball.
Menga has to set goals in two minutes following Scott Pitman's out of the race, but he can increase his chances.
When Keghan Jakob was brought to trial with Craig Holkat, his friend Allan tried to drag him into the front line.
The Rangers were good at controlling the ball, and they have a greater hope for a third game.
In the first quarter of his life, he and Steven Lowells fought, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian question.
In the first half of the year, the Rangers tried two games that were reserved for them, and in Ove Ijaria, the former Yim Kali of the Ibrax goalkeeper for Lasana and Colombia, and in Ove Ijaria, there were alarming attempts.
Livi's 34-minute theme is a contrast to the game, and no one will deny it as they deserve it.
Reingers are again unable to communicate with Jacob.
Scott Arfield gave her a ball like Declan Gallagher to Scott Robinson.
1]Jerard was able to create an impact on the rest of the rest of Rein Kent, as it was, as it was, on the climate of climate change, and as it was possible to create more force on the surface of Marilos, he was able to create the space that he played on this wing.
However, the Living Stones should use high-end football to play their fun game.
In Holtz, while strengthening their leadership in the final rounds, Makriger Jacob tried to stop before the attack started from the angle.
Glyne Middleton, who was replaced by Renders, asked for a penalty for his rape after being beaten by Jacob, but Thomson ignored him.

The new cancer vaccine has created an unusual immune system.
The new cancer vaccine has created and killed an unusual immune system for the human body.
The vaccine is produced by foreign cells that are immune to the immune system, which is the body of the medical team.
The method is to release the patient's immune cell in the laboratory.
Then it is common to see protein in many cancers, and it is repeated.
The vaccine being tried in connection with cancer is bearing promising results.
A woman who had been given the vaccine had been infected with a new cell, and the cancer on Ovaria had disappeared for over 18 months.
When the immune cell is removed from the patient and is placed in a laboratory, a protein is seen in many cancers, and the protein is called HER2 and is then made to fight the cell.
According to Jai Burzofsky, professor of the United Nations Cancer Institute in the Merida family, “the results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "As it causes various cancers to grow, including breast, ovarian, pneumonia, and pheasant cancer, Professor Brzofsky describes it.
The information on how to take the emetic cell from the patient and how to follow up on the cancer cell is the nature of what is being done to treat the chemotherapy.

HIV/AIDS has announced a 14% increase in China
China has announced that its citizens who live with HIV and AIDS have gone to 14%.
More than 820,000 victims say they're health officers.
In 2018 a second quarter of the year alone, it was reported that there were 40,000 newly caught swimming pools.
Most newly arrested persons have been involved in the business relationship, and they have changed from the past to the past.
Thus far, in some parts of China, HIV was passed on as a means of giving healthy blood.
But according to the Chinese health officer of the province of Yuanan, the number of HIV-positive people in this situation has been reduced to nearly zero.
But at the end of the year, EHV has grown to 100,000 people in China.
It is a matter of great importance to the Elgibeti community in China for the passage of EHV.
Similarly, it has been said that Chinese prostitution was increasingly committed as a Chinese crime in the year 1997 by Socién Elgibtin.
Studies indicate that 70-90% of men can marry men who have committed sexual immorality in the country.

Maxy Waters has denied Gop Center Data and explosions of 'faultous Lies' and 'Serreomatic Maschlocon' of the workman’s design
According to myself Maxy Waters, on Saturday, a fellow worker denied that he had filed personal information from the U.S. Senate on the Parliament's Wikipedia page.
According to the London democracy, "the extreme wing of the day" is being played, and they are turning around.
"False lies and many embarrassing lies," said Walter on Twitter's page.
According to the released information, it included an American home and telephone address: the Center of South Carolina and Lindsey Garham and Mike Lee and Orin Hath both of the Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday by an unknown man, Catitol Hill, who was being accused of sexual misconduct at the time of the election of the Central Panal by the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court.
It was only after three senators asked Cavanuk questions.
The traditional Web site has been linked to the Waters Office and the Waters Secretary's report, as has been recorded by the Gate Way Band and Red State.
"This baseless accusation is a complete lie, Waters," has been abandoned.
"The identity, personal information and security of my fellow worker was damaged by this false and fraudulent accusation, and the fraud of this information was never held accountable.
It's a lie that's full of baseless accusations."
The Waters statement was quickly criticized, also by former White House Secretary-General Ari Fleischer.
"This betrayal was anger, saying," wrote Fleicher.
"This shows that she does not have the patience to be a member of Congress.
A man should not be upset when he is accused of not doing his job.
They should not be unwilling.
They should not ask what the criminal's wishes are.
They must be calm and peaceful.
Fletcher tries to compare the situation of the Waters in contrast with that of the Court of Justice of Kavanuk, who was accused of being very angry at the Hüddeutsche Council.
In the middle of the election, Omar Navaro, who competes to pick up Waters from her seat, made his voice heard on Twitter.
"If it's a big truth," he wrote.
According to her opinion, Waters' office has changed this fraudulent accusation "by the right authorities and law enforcement bodies.
"We assure the perpetrators that they are exposed," he continued, "and to any of the members of our companies and to all their destructive and dangerous actions.
Johnny England Strick - Scattered Roman Atkinson
Now it is common to see the need for a new film in order to see the need for a demonstration in the new film in British view, and to recommend the opening of the John’s England concert, the comedy-commaid contract was first introduced in 2003 in Johnny Shaw, England, and in 2011 in Johnny and England.
How could Tang in Czechs make us feel as if we were completely dirty?
In any event, the Pap Id, the Goma, is the second time that John England has been re-renewed to resuscitate him-Ya-Ha-Hum by all.
He is indeed a useless spy, but he is a little confused and confusing, even though he has a little bit of a role to play in the London Olympic theme of 2012 by Mr. Bean's spirit and his masculinity.
First of all, a secret person who was built on the foundation of Atkinson on the now forgotten Barkleycard TV ad, has been engaged in much debate before it began.
On this new visit to Jii, there will be one or two good times.
I loved Johnny England as much as I loved him when he was wearing a knife on the top of the middle - century hat and a pedestal of the head.
Atkinson is visiting the frenzy of the body, but its sadness is especially painfully low, beyond the code, such as 007 and Mitch Emposible, compared to the goal of comedy.
As we have seen in Perso and Bin of Bin, there seems to be little place for adults but for children.
The current topic is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-breaker broke the English spies' ties to a very strict Weib, exposing the identity of the British spies in the field to a shock at the job of Jan Kevin Eldon, who played a small role in his work.
To the prime minister, who is proud and unconquerable, let him be the last man-made man, especially to a man who is losing his political ambition. Emma Thompson did everything she could on the character of this lying Teresa May, but nothing on the screen is done.
Her IT counselor has spoken out, and every surveillance job has been damaged, so she must bring a retired person.
This means that the confused John England himself, who is now the director of a rich man's school, is how to become a secret spy, some good bona fide men, here in England, like a rock star school.
England was sent back to Whiteholl for an urgent statement, where he was able to meet back with his former and very troubled assistant, Boh, Ben Miller.
Boh has now married, and a Mariner has stuck to, and this is Vicki Papadi.
Therefore, all the firm surveillance issues of Batman and Robin of the queen's firm office are back on the task of re-establishing the campaign by the beautiful Fém Fatale Ofella and Bultova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling dangerously into the hands of the evil tech billioner and is hoping to solve British computer problems, as seen by the rich Jason Volta, who plays with Jack Lasie.
England and Boh set out on their warm journey: They set fire to a French restaurant like a host, created trouble on a gift ship in Volta, and tried to use the Rahilite River to introduce himself to the Volta's inner room.
In the last series, all the break-ups have been made out, but the situation is so popular and so hot that the whole situation is like little children's TV.
My beauty is undiminished.
And can’t I stop thinking about John England’s other movies, and can the British movie industry offer justice by playing an appropriate role in its talent?
Laber denied that he had set up four days a week, but that five-day plans were in place.
The German Corbins Laber Party stated that it was thinking about launching four days a week, but that the pay would be five days.
It is said that the party wants the time savings obtained through the Industrial Intelligence (AI) revolution to be spent by the company's heads of time on a further day of rest for the workers.
On the third day, employees see that they use a week's vacation, but they take a fee to the house to make sure that it is done.
They said that the idea was that it would be in line with the party's economic agenda and that it would be planned to take over the country's employees in a way that would benefit the country's employees.
For about four days, the trade union has established a four-day barrier for employees to benefit from the changing economy.
The source of the long-standing Laber party is expected to be released before the end of the year, as reported to the Sunday Times.
"But not at once, the four-day work week's economy is a promising success for the party to rebalance the labourers and the party's overall industry plan in a way that supports the party's overall industry planning."
In view of the fact that Green Party made four days of an election campaign in 2017, the Labour Party would not begin by making this statement public.
But what has been hoped for is no longer being fully pursued by the Labour Party.
A LLPA spokesman said: “Four day is not a party policy, nor is it taking account of the party.”
The last week of the Labre meeting, last week, was used by Shado Cansler to explain the vision in the economics of the Social Revolution.
Mr. McDonnel said that if there were any "nameless workers" and "farms-in-laws" were in the service sector, they would lose power.
The chassel's plans also mean that the current shareholders in water companies may not be able to regain their full share because the Labour Government can make "resurrections" because of the illegality seen by the law.
It also confirms plans to create a portfolio of property assets that will account for between 10 and 500 percent of the price of private companies that will put employees in stock of up to £500.
Lidsley Graham tells '60 Ministry' that his analysis of Kavanah, by John Kennedy Fbiay, may change his mind.
Judge Bret Cavanah makes it clear that the FBI's investigation of the charges brought against him may have delayed his last voice for the Supreme Court's custody for at least one week, and that the Office's findings may have allowed any Republican senators to accept their support.
In a Sunday interview, the news representative of the "60 Minutes" visited the Republican Senate. John Kennedy and Lindsley Graham had asked them if they could find anything that could alter their mind.
Kennedy seemed more clear than his South Carolina friend.
"Finally, correctly," said Kennedy.
"I thought I was going to hear testimony, and I said I was talking to Judge Kavanah."
After this happened, I called him, and that charge came up, and he said, "You did?"
The decision was firm, decisive, and confusing.
However, it seems very difficult or impossible to change the sound of the graffiti.
Bret Cavanach has determined my desire and receives a charge that could cause trouble.
"I don't know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know this: Bret firmly denied, Christine mentioned Blacee Ford, and Graham added.
And he could not prove any man by name, whom thou callest.
The dead are 36.
Nothing is seen of me that changes.
What has the Global Citizen Festival done to reduce poverty?
Today, on Saturday, New York prepares the Global Citizen Festival, which is a traditional musical gathering of very close stars and a mission to end poverty.
Tens of thousands of people now living in the seventh year of the Global Citizen Festwal are gathered at Central Park Great Law, such as Janet Jackson, Cardy Bean Shoe Mendez, not only to enjoy entertainment but also to raise awareness of the reality of poverty, which is the ultimate goal.
The Global Citizen Festival is a non-compelling group of Global Poverty Projectists, who in 2012 claimed to be capable of ending poverty by increasing the number of people who are active in the fight against poverty.
If you are not willing to pay the ransom ticket (if you are not, if you are not) then the concert participants should complete a series of small jobs or "actions" as the "goodwill" service, written e-mails, telephone calls or other meaningful goals that will help them to stop poverty.
But how successful is the Global Citizen’s 12 - year - old to achieve it?
Is it because people think that there is real difference in how people want to see the scene, whether it is the right way to justify it or the “clicktivism ” that is, because people think that they have made a difference on the Internet or on the Internet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported more than 19 million "participants" from its supporters, moving it to set various goals.
He says that these actions have prompted the world’s leaders to be concerned about the determination of the world’s leaders and to shape more than $37 billion in policies that could have an impact on the lives of the population by 2030.
In the early 2018s, the group mentioned 390 job-related accomplishments and declarations, at least $10 billion or so.
The team estimates that up to 649 million dollars will be spent on the entire world population.
Of the major inventions, $4,700 tweets are promised to help Rwanda eliminate malnutrition if found by citizens of the world.
"With the support of the government, donors, national governments and just like any of the citizens of the world, we will make an account of social injustice, " said at London a new event in April 2018 by the Power of Nutrition Absador Trade.
U.K. has announced that more than 5,000 of the more than 5,000 acts of maternal and child nutrition have been done on the government’s government, with over 5 million mothers and children involved, are financially supported by the Force of Nutrition project.
In response, the FAQ asks a web page, "What do you care about us to avoid extreme poverty?"
The answer of the citizens of the world is, "It will be a long and difficult way. Sometimes we go down and fall.
But, like the great human rights and anti-particular activities before us, we succeed, because we are more powerful than one.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, S here Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe in Debora-Le Farnes and Hugh Jackman are just a few of the midpoints of their work being prepared this year in New York.

The US opinion has been strongly opposed by Germany, and has repeatedly demonstrated its determination to the project.
Germany’s Federation of German Industries (BDI), led by Germany’s Department of Engineering, calls for US to withdraw from the EU’s energy policy and from the two agreements in Berlin and Moscow.

U.S. ambassador charged China with Propoganda ads with "threats".
After a few weeks, the U.S.-China trade published a four - page ad that offers common benefits, published in U.S.A. daily, which was used by U.S. ambassador Beijing for propaganda in China.
President Donald Trump, who denies China, accused China of wanting to interfere with Congress's elections on November 6, U.S.A., and then took up the issue that led to the sale of China's Daily by De Money Rigister, who is most heavily sold in the U.S. State of Iowa.
The Trump case that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. elections has announced a new phase of the Washington campaign on China that UN authorities have reported to Reiters.
Although advertising is common for foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are now engaged in an all - out trade war that has forced them to cut down on the things that enter one.
In the early hours of the Chinese trade war, Chinese and U.S. specialists said that the red tapes were designed to harm the locomotives who supported the Tromp and Republican Party, such as Ioa.
In China, former U.S. ambassador and agricultural producer Terri Branstad Beijing, former leader of the U.S.
"China is now twice as likely to double its threat by publishing propaganda ads on our own free versions," wrote Branstad in the Sandays de Monne Regis.
"In order to spread propaganda, the Chinese government is using the free speech and free publications of the Americas to make advertising advertising on D. Monne Register, " wrote Brandtad.

“ One of China’s most famous newspapers, ” he added, “was not willing to accept his request to print it, ” which one of the newspapers said.
Republicans warn that women are being left out because of the fall of Kavanah before reaching the middle line of power
Despite the questions raised by the Supreme Prosecutor, Great Britain, Cavanach, has warned about the negative reaction of commentators, especially women, during the mid-election of power to stand by and defend them.
The feelings associated with this are intense, and most republicans show an open interest in moving forward.
Grant Richer, professor of political science at the University of Syracuse, Maxwell School of Political Science, spoke to Z Hill, published Saturday.
Richer is suspected that the last minute of an E.F.A. (R.-Arzona) review of the Sn.F.F.F. is sufficient to soften angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, and they will not forget it tomorrow, in November,” said consultant and national spokesman Karin Jean Pierre-Pierre, such as Washington, D.C.

Ford pointed out that prior to his testimony to list the sexual charges against the general prosecutor, who had filed charges before society, he could have received a strong negative response from the Republican commentators.

"Not just about the voice of the committee, the final voice, or the seat of the Kavanah, but about the way the republics have taken this and feel it," said Guy Secel, director of the U.S. party for democracy, the news station.
However, after Ford and Kavanah's testimony words, Americans seem to have been divided to some degree by a partial slide into the whole.
The new yogov voice presentation shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in the word for word of testimony, and 35 percent believe in cavanna.
They also believe that 38 percent of the Cavannah believe that he lied when giving testimony in a way that is said to be true or impossible, and that only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flemish’s press, FBI is currently examining the charges filed in Ford, as well as at least one other accuser, Diborah Ramírez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Committee last week that she had been drunk at 17 - year - old Kavanah.
Ramírez is accused of exposing his body to her face during a party in the 1980 ’ s when the candidate was in Yale.

In Laverne, he said that the expulsion of the first program was a feeling of "lowness" among all young people because "the love of men and women in the community was unacceptable."
He said: “For today, these low feelings, and different feelings, have given me the power and strength to be a winner.”
He wants to prove that he was something, so I don't get upset when they learn about sex.
The two-time Olympic copper medal is the most famous of the LGBT and uses its feature to say that it is not seen as a crime in the Australian Commonwealth Games.
He said openly because he wanted to give "hope" to others, without being self-rewarded.
The third - time World Champion from the 2013 - US film on the Justin Lance Black fall in love, he said, "I am impressed."
Dally, last year, he married Oscar, the greatest winner of his 20 years, but he never became the issue of age.
He said: “It was difficult to find someone of the same age who went through all of this in youth” — 14 years of age, and his father died of cancer at the age of three.
The couple were parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black in May.
"If you'd asked me last year, I'd just like to say, "I'd like to see you again," he said.
"You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
The Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His father Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011, has a similar name.
Dally refused to accept his father’s death, and he said that one of the last things he asked was that he wanted to be before him — that he had their ticket for London 2012.
He said, "I couldn't tell you that my father would not be with you to be a fugitive."
He said, "I had taken hold of his hand when the breath stopped, and I was sure that I wasn't in the final position until the breath stopped and died," he said.
In the next year, Dally won the 2010 Olympic copper race.

Michaelson’s stand changed on Saturday’s Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mikkelson has to change his stand on Sundays in his Ryder Cup for 47 times, but not to put on something unpleasant.
Mikkelson, who is playing for every two years in a race for the 12th season, was replaced by Jim Furyk on Saturday by a pair of four games.
Rather than being as powerful as the United States, the winner of the 5-time race divided the time by supporting and preparing for the game.
Even those who do not give up do not reach the stage of his playful years, and it is not appropriate for 48-year-old playmates, who are too busy and unrepairable, to have a national game field.
And if the field is not enough to discourage himself, it will be the same for the ninth Sunday game, Mikkelson, this week with the rookie tommy Fletwood, who created the four games to win a strong British Open, victorious Francesco Molinari.
The Americans, who began the 12 isolated games on 4th point, could testify to the importance of Mikkelson’s play if they did not start a major attack.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in himself, and I don't tell him much more.
"I realize the full role he now plays, and if he hangs his arm on me, he prepares for tomorrow, ” said Furyk.
"He has deep faith in himself.
He's amazing, he's done a lot more in the past, and this week he's been busy with it.
I didn't think that by chance he would add two games.
I thought a lot, but we thought we should go that way.
He wants to be like everyone else."
As for much of the Ryder's game, it has passed through Nick Faldo's honor of Sunday's game.
Since we are never able to do the show, the sense of humor in Ryder's game can show the end of his days.
Mikkelson won 18 times, 20 times win 7 times, but his survival brought invisible things to the team, says Furyk.
"He's critical, he's a jerk, he's a joker, he's a joker, he touches people, and he's great to find him in the team room."
"The young players are having fun with him this week, and it's sad to see.
"He gives much more than playing."
Europe’s Amber Thomas Bjorn knows that he will soon be gone to many different ways
Europe's dream of Thomas Bjorn, as he learned from his practice, can turn into an uncomfortable journey until the end of the Rider's game.
This first game was held for Valderrama in 1997, with a five-string, five-bit advantage over the Americans at the time, but with a little success, it won the game at the end of the week, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"Remember yourself that you were leading your head wide against Valderrama; if we had won, we would have been on the Broad Line, and we won on the Young Valderrama," says Bejn, the graduates of 2018 5-3 Friday and yesterday won the National Le Golf, after seeing Slobo,
So the story tells me, and all the members of the group, that this thing is not finished.
Tomorrow thou shalt bring forth thy strength.
Go up here, and do all the appropriate things.
The thing didn't cease until you found the number of them on the altar.
We don't say, and that's trying to win, and this is what's focused on.
I talked to him all together — I focus on 12 of our players on our side, but we know very well that there are big world players on the one hand and on the other."
He enjoyed the skill of heavy golf players, Bjorn added: "I never used to benefit myself in this thing.
The next day, let there be no more dreams.
Tomorrow, the individual’s qualifications are unique, and that is a different thing to do.
When things go well, it's great to be with your legs, but when you're alone, it's as good as a golf match.
The message you have to take to all players is that, tomorrow you have your best skills.
Now, you leave your neighbor for food, let him go, and so show him the best."
In contrast to Bujn, partner Jim Furyk expects his players to show him a better personal quality than they did in partnership, except for the four points he found three points together.
Furyk himself was on both sides of the big changes, and the winner of the Brockline team was before Europe finally rose "Miracle in Mediah".
I remember every word, saying, "Ben Crenshaw" replied in 1999, how to gather the players who are moving to the last day."
"Tomorrow we have 12 key poems, but as you've seen in the Brockline, Medinah would be better off removing that quick start.
As he comes to understand it, he puts pressure on a boxing game.
We've organized our tracks on a much larger basis and we've put the people in the way we've heard, you know, we're trying to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given to try and Roy McLroy on the top of the game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Feetwood and Ian Poulter, in order to follow the above half-European.
"I went in this order with this group's dishes because I thought it would cover up to the inside," Bjorn said on his single choice.
Germany’s new warship has been repeated over and over again
The German naval force had to be put into practice in 2014 to replace the Cold War, which was launched by the Allied Force, but because of corrupt systems and rising expenditure, there would not be until at least the following year, reports the State Media.
"Rheinland-Pfalz," the new pilot of Baden-Wuerttemberg-room, arrived in Sierra Leone, until mid-2019, when a military spokesman, such as Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship had to combine its marine power in 2004, but the difficult issue of prosthetics created problems with the Huguenot project.
In the past 2007, the four ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg, under the command of the Navy, replaced the ships of the Bremen-Class, which were old.
It is known as a medium-scale launcher, anti-flight and anti-shippest project, as well as some stealth technology, such as small radar, red light bulbs and sound signatures.
Other necessary forms of maintenance must be possible from the port of the country to two years' distance from the new swift warship.
However, with a series of delays, Dee Zeit pointed out that when they begin their service, they will be out of service to allow the German-Germany fleet to power the offshore force.
Bad-time F125 was a news item for the past, when German Navy authorities banned the use of the ship to Blohm & Vos chipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the ship's power was brought back to be built up by the vessel.
Little is known about the reason for the return, the German media said that if the ship was on the warfront, it would make it a major "software and hardware failure" that would make it costly.
Unlike the lack of software, it was necessary in a different way, because of the fact that Baden-Wuerttemberg-room ship can be sailed by 120 sailors, half of the manpower needed by the former Bremen.
The ship has been found to be extremely difficult, and this has reduced its efficiency and has killed its ability to increase its capacity further.
7,000 tons "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as a ship used by the Germans in World War II.
On the side of the credit card, the overall price of the project is becoming a matter of concern, including the training of mariners.
From the start, it has been said that €2.2 billion ($3.1 billion) has suddenly reached €3.1 billion ($3.6bn).
The problems surrounding the new swift warship are especially necessary with a warning of a reduction in German naval power.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the president of the German Parliamentary Protection Committee, announced that the naval power is indeed "ship-stripped" and that it is a "ship for the Arctic".
According to the authorities, the matter has increased on a regular basis, because old ships have ceased to operate, but no ships have been offered in place of them.
At least Baden-Wuerttemberg's quick-blown warships were unable to combine their forces.
A national secret listener on the secret life of every bird
A new study is being carried out on Scottish Highland to show how bats look like the earth and use it for food.
The discovery is believed to hate a new light on the unique behavior of the bird - mammals, and it commands future security activities.
The normal, high - sound pipistreles, as well as the long-eared brown bird and Daubenton, are followed by the Inverwee Gardens, Western Ross.
In general, special cavities are located around key areas of time in order to monitor the movement of the bird.
Using hand-holders, NHS workers and volunteers conduct mobile studies.
All records confirm the call of a professional voice for the clown bird and what kind of species it is doing.
A map and report of the life of the brain are prepared to create an image of the earth-pattern, which is explained by its nature.
Rob Dewar, the NTS Natural Protection Adviser, gives hope that the results of what areas of life are critical for the birds and that we use some species.
This information will help the management of life skills to determine the benefits of choosing forests, such as green work and flight birds and related species.
The number of bats has dropped dramatically in Scotland and throughout the UK over the past century.
Because of construction and development, the nests and the destruction of life are in danger.
It can pose a threat to wind turbines and lightning, such as bird paper and some building materials, as well as to the attacks of the dunes.
The fowls are not without doubt blind.
But when they are involved in hunting their food, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use a complicated method to find insects, or to identify obstacles in the way they fly.
NTS, more than 270 historical buildings, for 38 important parks, and for 76,000 alien land around the desert, are taken seriously by the clowns.
He said, "Several studies, screenings, and sometimes rescue, experienced experts."
The organization has set up the first and only species of Scotland bats, a nest for the eight, even in the Treave exhaust drums and Galloway.
He said that David Tampson’s inheritance was an appropriate rulership for them.
"This is a good place for bats in the Treave," he said.
We have old buildings, many old-age trees, and all of them good infrastructure.
But there is much unknown about the bats, so it helps us to understand exactly what we need to do here and elsewhere.
The destruction of a parent’s nest, which has stressed the need to make sure that there are no bats before repairing property, can take over the destruction of 400 women and children, perhaps the general population.
It's a crime to kill, attack, or destroy the birds or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrel, the protection of the Scotish bird as my own officer, encouraged his people to come to help.
As she said, "I don't know how many of our species are appropriate to learn more about our clowns yet."
When the lawyer prepared to accuse Germany’s magazine, Ronaldo ignored the accusation of rape
Cristino Ronaldo called the rape charge “a false news ” and said that people want to use his name to“ introduce themselves. ”
The lawyers were prepared to accuse the German news magazine Der Spiegel.
In 2009 at Las Vegas Hotel, Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, was charged with rape.
It was said that she had paid $375,000 to keep quiet about the handler from it; she reported on Friday.
During the trial hours in Instagram, he gave his 142 million followers a live video, Ronaldo, 33, the report "False News".
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
Today's false news, "Ballon d'Or's five times said in camera.
"They want to introduce themselves using my name.
Normal
They want to be famous for my name, but this is the work force
"I'm a happy person and everyone's good," the conversation added a smile
According to Reuters, "the unreceptive assault on the so-called individual freedom by Ronaldo's lawyers is preparing to accuse Dr. Spiegel"
"The player wants to deepen his cause of moral breakdown because of a recent violation of the most serious individual right, " says counsel Christian Schertz.
The charge was filed in June 2009 at Palms’ Hotel and Las Vegas Casino
It is reported that, on the basis of documents filed on the basis of the Clark County District Court in Nevada, in the night circle, Ronaldo and Mayorga were led to the corner where they were shot
From the trial, he said that he was "99 percent good" by "1 percent"
As the documents show, Ronaldo proved that the couple had sex and that he was a believer
Myorga, in addition to the police, said that she had photos of her injuries at the hospital but finally agreed outside court to "fear revenge" and "don't be humiliated"

Brexit (Bretin's Out of Europe Association); UK 'may be forever regretting the loss of its vehicles'
If Brexit lost his car to the world leader, UK's 'may regret it all', the executive of the commercial office, Greg Clarke.
If Toyota UK Britlin had been added to break up the EU without compromise, it would have been "disquieting" to indicate to BBC that the plant would temporarily cease its production to Dernaston
"We want a name," said Mr Clark.
As the Japanese auto signs say, time moves along the Brexit border may have a negative effect on job loss
Toyota's Auris and Avensis, the Burnaston factory, produced in the past night, has been sent to a 90 % of the Europe’s cut-off pool by 150,000
"In my view, Britain will stop in our factory from the last product produced in April." said Mavin Cooke, director of the Toyota Administration at Bournston, Morvin Cooke
Other UK manufacturers have noted how they fear that a cross-border business will be carried out, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, was following Brexit when he closed his small factory on Oxford for a month
According to car manufacturers, the main concern is the lack of stability in the car industry
Toyota's line of literature leads on the "just-time" basis, therefore, it is offered every 37 minutes by the UK and EU suppliers to authorized drivers
On April 29, the UK announced that if the UK were to leave the EU without compromise, it could break border law, which would cause delays and shortening of goods
In Derbysshire, the factory could not have been handled by the Toyota, and production could have stopped, says the company.
About her future connection with the EU, the government plan of Theresa May "is a real adjustment to detachment on board" says Mr. Clark
“We need a name, ” says BBC Radio 4 today, “but we need this opportunity, and not just the success we now have, but we need to enjoy it, so we need an agreement that can bring it to us. ”
"We want to continue the most effective supply chain not only from Toyota but also from other producers."
Toyota could not tell how long the production would stop, but he warned that the cost of the increase could reduce the factory’s and job opportunities over the long term.
On Burnston, a 24-year-old member of the United Nations Society in the factory was very concerned that he said, "These jobs will never return if I leave.
The government-resident said: "We have seen an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosentein is easy to expand again, says White House
According to Donald Trump, a high-value meeting of law attorneys with Rod Rosnestein could move into another week; the reason for the continued conflict with the Supreme Court was that the candidate, Bertt Kavanaugh.
Rosnestein controls Russian intervention, the relationship between Trump and Russia, and the work of its Special Adviser Robert Muller, who examines the independence of the president.
Trump has not expelled and expelled Muller's freedom to be threatened, and the news has spread the Washington news for months.
At the beginning of this month, when Rosminstein spoke with Trump, he read what he was able to do with the president on the 25th of the revision: New York Times.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, the White House went and recorded that it would be released at midway.
Instead, it is known that there will be a Thursday meeting with the United Nations on New York.
Trump Rossenstein said that he would "choose" but that the meeting was delayed to eliminate the potential conflict with the members of the council, which was confirmed by Cavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who was accused of sexual harassment.
In view of Kavanaugh's question, a week's FBI investigation was ordered by Trump, and all members of the Constitutional Council should be involved in the delay.
The head of the Trump Information Office has come up with Sarah Sanders, the new Fox News.
She asked about the Rosentein meeting, saying, "It's possible to move into another week, if this week it's been a week's time.
But we see and always want to inform the media of something new."
Some authors may be trying to prove it: Sanders did not give a press release on the White House from September 10.
Why did author Chris Wallace ask?
Sanders said, "I agree with the fact that "Sabi" is not being hated by TV journalists.
From that point on, the direct contact between Trump and the media has made a stronger comment.
"We've seen numbers more questions and answers than any previous president."
Expressions will still exist, and Sanders said, "If the media have a chance to ask the presidents of the United States directly, that is far better than to say anything to me.
We've been trying so hard to do that for the past few weeks, and we've been doing it very well, and if you can speak to the president of the United Statess, it'll become one of the parts of the press."
Trump always receives questions when he participates in the White House or the open meetings or he leaves the assembly with great guests.
Only a few congregations are free press releases.
This week the president of New York showed a confusing face before they met without power and reporters.
The health spokesman wrote fear at Brexit for the EU’s workers in Scotland NHS
The author of health wrote to the members of the EU's work in Scotland NHS and to continue their duties with food from the poor-Brexit.
Jane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until you left the EU UK.
The Scutish government is determined to meet the demands of citizens working for EU public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "The trend between the summer, the UK and the EU continues, leading to a decision to be expected.
But the UK government was in the process of stopping an agreement that could also have been made.
And I know that they make thee to wander at a time that is very uncertain unto all.
That's why I want to talk about how many times I give the members of each job, the contribution of their nationality, without thinking.
Throughout the EU, and above all, colleagues have provided valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the health service, and have raised the sick and the sick.

Tennessee State Tiggers linkbacker Crisis Abercrombe on Saturday 31-27, at Vanderbilt Committees on a head injury accident, reported on Tennessean's Mike Organ.
Rod Reded, the principal trainer of Tennessean Province, told the reporters that the damage occurred just half an hour before it was over.

Foreign rulers are charged with high printing duties when they buy UK property
Foreign rulers are also required to pay a high fee for printing in order to help the homeless with the new Tory Plans
Corbyn’s young electors are less successful
The printing obligation will increase when they do not pay UKK tax
Up to £120 million a year is reserved for the house of the homeless
Foreign state rulers buy UK property to pay for high printing obligations — in addition, money is used to help homeless people, and Theresa May is known today.
Corbyn’s work is seen as an attempt to reduce the success of the trip to attract young voters by making a commitment to offer more affordable homes and by reducing their incomes.
The increase in printing will be on individuals and organizations who do not pay UK tax, and money will also help to fight on government roads.
In addition to the current printing obligation, the higher fees may be as high as - 3 per cent, including the high rates of second houses and the purchase - rents two years ago.
The financial inventory will keep up to €120 million higher.
Up to 13 percent of London’s newly built homes have been purchased by UK-subsidised residents, rising prices, and for the first time, it is difficult to set foot on houses’ ladders.
Because of the large number of foreign rulers who spend most of their time abroad, many rich areas — especially the capital city — have become “citys of the Spirit”.
Boris Johnson, who came up with the new directive, is two weeks from the time that many young people have reduced the obligation to have their own home.
He is responsible for the fact that large construction companies have increased the cost of homes because they have not taken advantage of them, and he insists that we leave it to those who are able to adjust the "dangerous housebreaking" of Britain.
Mr. Corbyn Ian has introduced a series of improved housing, rental control, and "destructible" systems.
He wants to give the council great authority to build new houses.
R.R. May said, "Last year I said that I had taken up my prime minister to restore the British dream: that life must be better for all generations.
And he is to repair our markets of broken houses.
Britain will be open to people who want to keep living, to establish, and to find a new life.
However, it is not true that, like the hard-won British workers, people who are not living in the UK are easy to buy for the homes of foreign organizations.
For many people, homelessness has been very remote, and the reality of sleeping on the street, which is glorious.
Jack Ross: 'My last wish is to run Scotland'
"My last wish" level, says Jack Ross, head of Sanderland, is to be a Scotland trainer.
The Scott, 42nd, now League One, is making the fight to replant life on the top of the third point.
St Mirren moved in this summer into a stadium of light, leading in the past season to the Scotish Premiership.
"I want to play with my country as a player."
I got a B-ball, "Rox for BBC Scotland's superb voice."
When I was a boy, I grew up with my father by seeing Scotland in Hampden a lot, and it was always a thing that brought me back to mind.
This can be achieved if I am successful in running a group.
The rice substitutes, such as the Disk Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic leader, whose name was previously built following his departure from Barnsley and Ipswich, said that such a large group would not cause anxiety.
"For me to succeed this hour will he swear, 'Can I return this group to Premier League?'
This group's structure and supply, without any doubt, is based on Premier League, ” he said.
"This doesn't want a simple job, but it's only if I can get back to the group that I see as successful."
Rox stayed in Dumbarton for security training and was only three years in the Heats' 15-month training race at the State level.
It has helped Alloa to recover from this decline to the third grade, and St. Myrren has changed them from the downside to victory in the next season.
And Ross said that he had been very impressed by his playful work in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"Perhaps it was a real transition," recalls Alloa, where he found Alloa.
I've heard from my heart that training is a real trick to me, and it just goes beyond playing.
It seems confusing, because I am well adjusted, I have a reasonable way of life, and I have found some reasonable heights.
But it can be difficult to play.
There are many things that you must pass through every week.
He has a feeling of right, that I will not be ashamed of the burdens and pressures of his work, and that I will teach the things.
I always wanted to train, and now I'm working, my whole age of knowledge was on my own, and I've had a very good feeling."

The exact time for a bottle of beer is Sunday 5.30 pimm, found to be low
The summer heat storm has made it easier for British consumers to grow their incomes, but it has increased the pressure on restaurants.
Drinking liquor groups developed 2.7 percent sales in Julie, but restaurant income was 4.8 percent lower, according to figures
“ The next light of the sun and of England’s long - standing blue bowl, ” said the Swedish trade consultant, Peter Martin, who collected the numbers, “means that Julie has followed a similar cycle of events with the previous month of John, and that when drinking houses rose 2.8 percent, the restaurants were even more affected and the restaurants were only more affected.
Food trade in John’s home is responsible for a slight decline of 1.8 percent in Juliet
Drinkers and drinkhouses, who focus on drinking, are more powerful than restaurants.
But even drinkers who focus on food, like restaurants, have suffered a lot of damage.
It's like people go out just seeking to drink.
With well-insured drinks and alcohol sales, it was 6.6 percent higher than a month, and it was three times as low as a meal."
“ These results will continue as we see them at the end of April.
The influence of climate and social or sports coverage will be very influential when it comes to sales outside the home market.
It is not surprising that food groups continue to fight, but that the average price of 4.8 percent of sales is higher, especially than the price that is getting worse.
He tells us a time when the tallest food-for-food trade movements could not have come at a worse time, and we believe that the more moderate temperatures we spent in August would give us a few short periods of relief to be needed."
The overall growth of sales was 2.7 percent in the July area, with sales and restaurants, and the opening of new ones, reflecting the deterioration of the process of starting new services
The Yuki's retail, alcohol, and food market controller, Cooper Pitch Tracker, who has combined the information of the Kwanni, will collect and select 47 million commercial groups, and set up an example of the Indians.
One in five children has social media that they hide from their parents
One of the five children, a few of whom are like 11 - year - olds, has made it clear that they have a secret social media use from their parents and teachers.
The study of the 20,000 high school students has led to growth of the 'incorrect 'Introduction' page.
The news has made him king of the fear that the sexual content of the news is being spilled.
20 percent of the students said that they had a "proper" for their families.
One out of five children, a few of them, like an 11-year-old, are creating social media uses that are hidden from adults.
The mention of 20,000 high school students shows rapid growth of the 'instraight' uses of 'instraight' -- a source of information from the photo media
The news has made him king of the fear that the sexual content of the news is being spilled.
Twenty percent of the students said that they had private subjects that were not acceptable to their parents.
A 13-year-old woman who accidentally saw her son in the secret field found a mother begging others for a "fearful" son of the ten.
The DJC found that 40 percent of schools without financial support have two personal summaries, half of which have a personal use.
H.M.C., chief executive, Mike Buchanan, said: “It is disturbing to see that many of the children of the tenants get into the temptation to create online sites where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doil will be in the Scotland athletic board.
Elid Doil was elected director of the General Council of the ruling body to the Board of Telecommunications of Scotland.
Dol explains that Scotland’s fashionable street and field athletes and the chairman of Ian Bitty have a great opportunity to benefit from the many stories we have in our past to guide his sports.
"Elid has great honour in Scotland, Yuke, and Lem Athletics, and we are confident that the Scottish Atlas will benefit greatly from bringing her to the board."
She said, "I hope that I can do exactly what I want to do and help lead the sports in Scotland."

On Twitter he wrote: "Today I had an accident to wake up to the sudden control of the body a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that he would determine my recovery, or what degree of time it would be.
It was a hard work that took time, but I have learned to do it all over again, to walk again, and I am doing practice to make it easier today!
Thank you for your letters of encouragement! ”
Breast milk production, which compares mothers to cows, divides online advertising
The breast - milking device company divides ads into a webcaster, comparing it with the cows that chew the baths
With regard to what is called the "first silent breast milking instrument", the public information technology industry has released an announcement showing that the new delivery instrument is free to mothers.
Four right mothers were playing a single song, which included this type of poetry, in a door full of straw, “Yes, but I don’t say I don’t see myself, ” and “If you don’t notice very well, these cows are not my breasts”
The trends continue: "Take out, get out, feed my babies, read out, read out, speak to my women."
However, the advertising published on the Facebook page of the organization has created a debate on the Internet.
With 77,000 eyes and hundreds of messages, the video accepted the combined responses, and many are able to release insects and raise their own "worship" open up
"Uiling the cows to introduce this product is a very bad decision.
According to us, they had to grow and bear milk, except if they were born within a few days, they would be stolen."
In the absence of a knowledge of breast milk extraction, hannet sits in her carer's chest (Elvi/mother)
Another commented: "It is very disturbing for both mother and child to understand.
But why not let them know that breast milk is produced for mothers who should take care of their babies?
Another man added: "This is an ad that has developed knowledge of the age"
Others have defended the ad, believing that a single woman found the song to be "very funny"
"I think this is a superior thought.
If I had one, I would still have breast - feeding
Drinking made me to feel like a cow.
But I took what I wanted to say, that the ad was rather unfeeling.
This is the best product ” he wrote
Another commented: "This is a funny ad that focuses on mothers who use it (often in their workplaces or toilets) and those who feel like "lams".
This is not an ad that praises the industry or that sets out to be good."
At the end of the video, the women's group announced that they were all celebrating the undisable needles of their breast-recorded chests.
It is based on the notion that many women who use the formula behind the campaign say that they feel like cows.
However, with no sound, no ropes or tubes, and no unknown way of doing so, Elvis sits in the place of the nurse, takes over the area, takes over the women's movement, grabs their children, and takes them out.
Anna Ballarin, founder of the Essidi, commented: "Elvi's extraction is a revolutionary product, so it should start with courage and anger.
We wanted to focus on women and dairy cows, and we wanted to make clear the incredible freedom that the new arrival brought with it, and we wanted to focus on all the wrongs.
It is not the time to start an Elvi filter while holding the front pages.
During the Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion display at Dizener, Martha Jakubowski.
Hundreds of refugee children moved safely to the tent camp at the border of Texas.
Although the prison refugee population has reached the end of the prison population, it has not changed with the light of the monthly censuses, as the Trump administration has made it more difficult for children to accept the negative talks and policies of the Trump administration.
According to tradition, most of the caves are refugees who themselves are not informed, and when they are approached to ask for a child, they fear that they will be in danger of being able to stay in the country.
The fear increased when federal officials in June announced that they should provide compensation to their families and that the information would be shared by the immigration authorities.
Last week, the first immigration and customs authorities testified that they had arrested more than a dozen people who had appeared to be the only adult Adam/Hewan who had not arrived.
The Egencist found that 70 percent of those who were later imprisoned had no previous criminal record.
"The 80 percent of the individuals, or family members, who are close to 80 percent of the individuals, are in this country by law, and most of them are criminals who come from nowhere else.
So Mr. Albins said, "We are going to keep track of the individuals we speak of."
On the basis of Schletter's quarter, the authorities have introduced new rules to speed up the process of the children, requiring that the months of imprisonment be tried more than 60 days later, the authorities being arrested.
Many are invited to appeal to the immigration judge on video conference, not in person.
Those who were thought not to meet the conditions are quickly driven out of the country.
Reports from Schillter and the middle of recent months increase the children’s chances of being in prison longer, leading to physical recovery and escape.
The complainants say that the most common symptoms of this type of anxiety are that of a child who fights for some reason, such as a lot of it, are seen in a larger area, such as the Tornello.
Many have added that having children prepare emotionally or leave their friends without sufficient time to move to the tent city can only aggravate the disturbing situation that they are fighting.
Let Syria have Léance, France, and Turkish "wrestle forces" leave its home
In delivering a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Moma called for Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, but the country's war is now in its eighth place
Moallem, who serves as Deputy Prime Minister, says that his foreign forces are on Syrian soil, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that he is "resolved to do it properly".
He said to the audience: "The taxman must be released, and he must be free of any circumstances."
Since 2011, in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died, more than millions of people have been displaced from their homes, said: “The war against terrorism has ended. ”
Damascus said that it will fight this holy war, until we have cleansed all the provinces of Syria from the terrorist groups and from any outside body of the law.
The United State has mainly in Syria in 2000 two powers of the Cruise and the President of the Syrian Arabs, who are opposed to Sir Al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 foot soldiers in a war-torn country.
He said it was good for refugees to return to refugee situations, but he criticized "the lack of rational fears" that motivated refugees to return to "a few Western countries".
He said: “We have called on international society and human support organizations to set the stage for return. ”
"They are giving the right political form to human affairs"
The United State and the European Union have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding until a political agreement has been concluded between the band and the opposition.
UN diplomas said that the recent agreement to establish a free period of peace between Russia and Turkey, which was the last major strong hold of the Mathematician, created an opportunity to press for his political talks.
The Russian-Turk Accord covered the country of three million people, which was attacked by Syrian forces that supported Russia.
However, while he was convinced that the treaty had “a clear end” and that his military action would make it possible for the Lebaneses, who were linked to Alkadiya, to make the“ complete destruction” of the conflict, he expressed his hope that he would bring about the diamonds, including those who would be “completely destroyed” by the armed forces.
The UN messenger Stéphane de Steura hoped that the meetings would soon begin with the start of a new committee from the government and from opposers to move out of Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moalum set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, warning against "restricting the current state texts" and warning against interference.

When a choice is made outside of the well-organized part-time authority, the council's competitions flow like a flood.
It is not surprising that the 17th-century of Pennsylvania saw the vast amount of money, and thanks to the fall of Congressi circuits, it brought two seats back into a single band
This recently re-established Pietsburg circuit puts the former Democratic representative, who won a special election last spring in another circuit.
The Lamb competes with other seats of the Republican Kaz Rosefus, the former 12th circuit of Pennsylvania, which now represents the new 17th - largest city.
The maps were reopened after the pre-Court of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had declared that the pre-Courts had changed their borders in a way that would benefit the republics in a way that did not respect the state.
The new 17th - century competition for the strong financial competition brought about a sudden gap between the financial supporters of the main parties, the Democratic Campine International Committee (DCC) and the National Republican Campine Committee (ENRSC).
Lamb, the most famous name in Pennsylvania, has won a narrow victory over the 18th Congressional district of Pennsylvania with the result of a special choice made in March.
That seat had been seized by a republican over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the circuit by 20 points.
Political commentators have given them a chance for the narrow domination of democracy.
In order to punish China for its support, the U.S. Salvador has taken care of the situation, and then it has been withdrawn from its action.
The diplomats found that despite a little pressure from the Dominican Republic and Panama, they had already recognized Beijing.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a warm relationship with President Juan Carlos Varella, president of Panama, and had a hotel in Panama until his Creators expelled the Tranp Management Group.
The Foreign Affairs Department stated that the U.S. diplomatic authorities had decided to summon officials from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama for “their decisions not to give recognition after Taiwan ” at the beginning of the month, Heiser Nort, a spokesman for the parliament.

Vice-President Mike Pence, in a way that indicates the invisible meaning of the program, has now been selected to give a speech at the mid-octber conference.

Their accounts are confirmed by the speaker who spoke in a situation that is near the governor's office, and whose name is not revealed.

The next added confidence is the report of Robert Muller, Special Adviser, who sees a potential obstacle to the justice of Mir.
According to a few, Mr. Muller is turning the investigation into an attack on our elections. The Trump campaign is turning him to find out that he has secretly agreed with Russia.

Sara Palin's eldest son was charged with assaulting his roommate.
The first son of Sara Palin, former governor of Alaska and president of the capital, was attacked by an attacker.
According to a report published by a young man in Alaska by police officers on Saturday, Palin, a 29-year-old young man in Alaska, Wasila, who was arrested, attacked by a roommate, interfered with the police process, and found it difficult to arrest.
According to the police report, when she tried to call the police about the crime, she kicked it out.

On Saturday's trial, when asked about the case on the news network, he said he was "certainly free of crime."
Palin has three first-class criminal charges, which means that it will be paid $250,000 to keep him in prison for up to one year.
He was also charged with a second crime, a one-day prison and a $2,000 charge.
This is not the first time a crime charge is filed on Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with beating his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
This crime is now being dealt with by a court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of harming his partner, of interfering with the attack process, of having a weapon that linked the incident to the violence, and of being addicted to addiction.
A loving person accuses me of beating my face:
Sarah Palin's comments about her son's evil actions, which occurred after his son's return from Iraq, were criticized by the legal authorities for the reason that he suffered from post-traumatic mental illness (PTSD).

Federal researchers are asking for a death penalty for terrorist attacks on New York City
The federal prosecutor’s policies in New York are asking for a death sentence on Seppholo Psypove, a terrorist attack that led to the death of 8 people. This special punishment has never been imposed in Huala since 1953.
Sipove, 30, at Ottabour's low-speed Manhatan, has done the job of using a rental car on the western highway, thus damaging the road's Michael and the footmen.
On the basis of a death sentence in the southern New York region, researchers should make sure that he intended to cause serious bodily harm.
Both cases will have the ability to escape the death sentence on the basis of the court's document.
A week before the attack, the Federal Supreme Court filed charges of 22-seeming crimes, eight suicides, and violations of law and damage to motor vehicles.
According to the researcher, the attack said that he wanted "long-term planning and preparation" and that he described Sapiov as "very cruel and rude."
The document states: "Cyfolo Habiblevik Psipov of the Diego Enrique Angeli, Nicolas Clives, Heran Ferrucci, the Diago Mendoza, and Aljandero Demian Pagunko families and friends have died and suffered damage. "
Five wounded visitors from Argentina came to her.
In the South of New York, the death sentence has been passed by a dozen years since it finally covered the matter.
The accused Calid Barnes was accused of killing two jurists, but in September 2009, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last death sentence in New York federal cases was held in 1953 by Julies and Etel Rosenberg, married couples, and by helping Soviet Union to obtain information in the cold of the war two years ago.
Both were sentenced to death on an electric chair on July 19, 1953.
On the basis of the court document, Sipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, was expressed that he did not feel regret during the last days of the attack.
According to the police, he felt that he had no regrets about his work and that he felt good about it.
Sapov, an ISS terrorist group, told investigators that after watching videos on their phone, he had been motivated to carry out the attack.
The police told me to ask in the hospital room for an ISS terrorist group to be hanged on a flag.
On the 22 charges against which he was brought, he said, "I am innocent of the crime."
The federal public attorney for Sepopov, David Paton, stated that he was "very upset" in his judgment.
"As Paton explained, asking for the death penalty is more likely to be a mental disorder for anyone involved in this process than to give him a firm life imprisonment in which he will never be released in any way."
Sipov’s group had already asked the lawyers not to ask for the death penalty.

What kind of public opinion does Pyonge not make?
Many North Korean traitors have acquired South Korea's citizenship.
Like Seoul, more than 30,000 South Koreans have been crossing the border on the illegal road since the 1953 war.
Many flights through Shayana, Nachou, Shaina's long border with Korea, and this is very easy to hide from both of the two Koreas.
