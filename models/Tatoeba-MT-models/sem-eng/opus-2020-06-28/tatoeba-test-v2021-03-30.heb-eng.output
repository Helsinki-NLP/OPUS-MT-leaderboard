Tom was shocked.
I'll do as you say.
Tom bets on the wrong horse.
Please explain the rejection.
Thank you for paying attention.
We waited for you for hours until you showed up.
Tom wasn't the only one who got up this early this morning.
The road is too narrow for truck passage.
We're in trouble.
How many students are there at school?
The feeling is it's the right thing to do.
Tom knows Mary's hiding something.
They deserve everyone to die.
I barely knew him.
Many animals that have lived for thousands of years are no longer there.
Let's go.
Have you had a nice weekend?
Am I stupid?
She was depressed because of all her problems.
Are wedding meals at all costs?
Because the rain stopped. He went on a trip.
The doctor knew how to deal with such an emergency.
The temperature dropped by 10 degrees.
I know this neighborhood.
She applied for Viza.
I thought it was all over.
It's dangerous to swim at night.
It's just like fighting wind security.
I don't care about the risk.
It's weather forecast time.
It looks hard.
That man's dangerous.
She cooked us a wonderful meal.
He was a soldier during the war.
I'm on the seaside.
It was my first thought.
We don't blame you.
We can't live without sleep as we can no longer live without food.
Someone just called.
They knew better days.
He's alive right here.
If you don't hurry, you'll never get to the village.
We think the reason for his success was hard work.
I'm sick of it.
It's all up to your decision.
You're thin.
He's in the mind, his hand is supporting his forehead.
There's not much to say.
Look, here he comes.
She was really cold.
It's on my job list.
Be careful not to sneeze your knee.
I gave it to my mother.
Stop wasting time.
I felt pretty bad.
My hobby is reading.
I'll have my coffee after dinner.
I don't forgive you.
They don't believe you.
That wasn't supposed to happen.
I don't want to learn tonight.
Tom thinks Mary made a mistake.
I always knew it was meant to grow.
It rained quietly.
Could you send this letter in a quick mail?
Close it.
Tom's not responsible.
Hey, guys, I'm Tom, and I'm here with Mary.
You look beautiful tonight.
We had one problem with the talent yesterday.
Tom visited Mary in October 20th.
When I got home, I found your letter waiting for me.
They're Russian.
It's easier than it looks.
She looks to me like a real, reliable person.
An athletic Tom.
He tried.
We can't survive without your help.
I was the one who suggested it.
This affair isn't as good as his last affair.
They stayed this way for a while.
This path is dangerous.
Can you show me the way to the library?
I stayed home all day and read books.
That's my decision.
It's okay.
I forced him to go.
Get him to come watch the movie.
Tom was an exaggerator.
Don't be afraid of me.
I know exactly how you feel.
I met Tom in January.
They made a joint decision about the divorce.
Stop making fun of me.
I'm in a mood today.
It doesn't happen much.
We're planning on visiting Mr. Smith tomorrow.
He's got a comfortable nature.
I never want to leave this place.
My son is my biggest headache.
Please sit down!
I can't drive in the car.
She invited each of us to the ice cream.
She played the play.
Tom told me he didn't see Mary all day.
I don't like being alone on the beach.
I never plan anything.
Do you have a map?
Tom was sweaty.
Should I sell this?
They're calling by handmarks.
Maybe we should ask someone for help.
I'm hungry.
That one's hard to read.
I've been begging for a week and still haven't recovered.
We started going again after she recovered.
Is there an English-Phian dictionary on the shelf?
The gun's up.
We're too few now.
We have to stay alert.
What's wrong with Tom anyway?
They were born with a child.
Tom seems troubled.
Maybe Tom's telling the truth.
Civilization is now a threat of nuclear war.
I often have nightmares.
The company decided to hire two new secretaries.
Please give me a pillow.
Tom almost killed both of them.
I wanted to watch this movie with you.
Come at least on six.
I'm hiding from your clue.
The device is very intuitive.
I'll get it back right away.
Tom and Mary are miserable, too.
What group does your friend include?
We're just gonna stay.
Please be quiet.
Tom decided to stay back.
Shut up, please.
Do you like what you see?
Give me a second chance.
It's natural.
Don't ever write the words "Mock Leaf" and "Mock Cobb" in German!
It's a violent neighborhood.
You'll be surprised what you can learn in a week.
There are animals that can feel close to the storm.
How can I ever forgive Tom?
This house looks abandoned.
This is the perfect place for Marv.
Consult the doctor.
I'm jealous.
These are my friends.
She's in love with this kid.
Tom didn't finish all his homework.
How do you know about Tom?
You sound my childhood.
I know you'd do the same to me.
In the fall two years have raised their color and turquoise.
Tom never admits by mistake, because he thinks it's a sign of weakness.
That's how I like it.
She pretends she didn't meet Maria.
It's the other river in Japan.
No one's happy.
I don't have to nobody at all.
Tom was speaking incoherently.
He's married and father to two.
Could have been a failure in the answer.
He's running his bike every week.
Don't turn off the computer.
From this distance, you can't tell her anymore.
She was instructed by her former doctor and transferred to another hospital.
I was out of protagonist.
My best friend is Irish.
It's more complicated than I thought at first.
I don't know anything about him.
I only had a few beers.
The man who blew the car is Mr. Jones.
I owe you to my friend.
I stayed calm.
She likes to try new things.
I heard him bite.
Move on to the next page.
Did you become an angel?
I hope it can happen now.
Yupsco materials.
Did I touch the exposed nerve?
There are many time places in big cities.
The first blow is half the battle.
I'm not sure.
I really saw a ghost.
You recovered from the shock?
Tell Tom I'm going for a ride.
It's all on the head.
Do you happen to know where she lives?
Tom and Mary are probably gonna get married one day.
Their house was set on fire.
I like that picture.
Grab a nap.
Eventually, his dream came true.
I worked very hard.
Not so much for him to die.
It didn't come up with her to answer the question.
The oranges are rich in vitamin C.
I'm sure Tom told you I'd be here.
This method is a benefit and a lack of it.
He hides the fact that he expelled his wife.
Shut your big mouth.
Tom told Mary about his new car.
Who invented the dynamite?
You're the greatest love of my life.
- Fruity experience.
Where's your money?
Tom asked Mary to sing harder.
Sorry, I can't stay long.
I don't know if it's up.
Where's the toothbrush?
Let's get something cold to drink.
These are Spaniards.
I want a guitar like John's.
It won't bother us if you take pictures from the outside.
The target is dedicated to the means.
You seem to know a lot about it.
Are you a supporter or a resistance to a fall?
Please don't interfere with this.

Today I won't get an e-mail from anyone.
I've been waiting for you.

Talking English in Canada?
That's so impressive!
We wanted dessert.
Tom's not getting up soon enough.
Hello, how can I help you?
Tom directed his gun to the target.
I believe my friend grows my horns.
It'd be better if you left.
Donald Trump suffers from dementia.
Don't ask, please.
I'm coming to kill you.
I like the inter-Arab time.
You have to go.
You ready to go out?
I know how that must sound.
Can anyone help me out here?
Where was Tom thrown to the prison?
I learned from the best.
Don't hurry to protect me.
I only know that.
Don't ignore me again.
There's to use protective helmets.
That's Tom's locker.
I'm sure I won't recommend Tom for the job.
You should try not to forget the time.
Will you go to the U.S. next year?
Think about your future.
As far as I'm concerned, I don't trust him at all.
I don't know what to say.
It rained yesterday.
She was caught with her pants down.
I know you might think, I'm too young.
I can't help him.
It didn't go that far.
How's everybody feeling?
We're supposed to be safe here.
Have you eaten breakfast today?
There's a bridge three miles up the river.
Tom suggested Mary not to do that.
I know you think there's no hope.

It's impossible to provide.
Come back to your chair.
She chose a hat to fit her new dress.
I spent the last Sunday sitting at home.
Let's not do anything that could upset Tom.
I'm short of money.
I'll finish reading this novel soon.
Tom doesn't seem interested in what's going on.
I don't want you to see my daughter anymore.
You guys don't go out there.

We never agree.
We were glad we were alive.

Did you decide where you'd eat lunch?
I changed my theory.
She was kind enough to pick me up from the house.
I ran.
Tom's an accountant.
Raise your left hand.
I doubt his statement.
I think they've encountered some kind of problem.
This movie is boring.
Where to go and what to see was my main concern.
My longest romantic relationship lasted four months.
She never told me yet.
Tom's an old hat hat he's always wearing in the rain.
