Nothing perfect.
Have you done all your work?
He's stupid and untrue.
Are you Sami's daughter?
I convinced him he was wrong.
The pool is so deep.
Agreed.
That can't be true.
I just went to check on something.

Where's my key?
All I have is a need I like, it's a lot of fun.
I don't know why.
We have to do this ourselves.
That wasn't my teacher.
He didn't understand Sammy.
What happened last week?
I'm not ready yet.
He took my money.
I'm sure Tom won't.
What's the matter with you?
A Sami boy was asleep.

You're still breathing, aren't you?
I'm drinking water.
It destroys 10 million hectares of old forests, or it remains every year.
We don't want to go too early.

It's a good idea.

You didn't cry?
Sami tried to explain it to everyone.

His words and deeds are contradictory.
You have to control yourself.
This is a work that benefits others.
This is the time it usually comes.

But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we will face, and I will listen to you, especially when we differ. Above all, I will ask you to participate in efforts to rebuild this nation in the same way that I have been pursuing two hundred and twenty-one years ago; a stone stone, a hard heart, and a hand that will work over my hand.
Born specifically in this room.
I've been wanting to stay in bed all day.

Killed in battle.
Tell me, come on.
And I've got Ta're on it.
Do they take care of the dog?

Keep him and his principles safe.
I'll meet him one day.
Izzy, huh?
It turned out I was right.
I'll give it a shot.
If you eat too much, you're getting fat.
Some people read the newspaper and watch TV at the same time.

- I'll make her happy. - I'll make her happy.
Lily's far from danger.
We're surprised.
He came to ask us to help him.
I think I'll stay for a while.
I need to talk to you about something emergency.
You're so nice to me.
Do you understand me?
I don't understand that.
Sammy's standing at the door of Lily.
I know I'll never forget you.
Don't forget it.
Samy wanted to punish Lily.
Which one would you prefer? Is that or that?
Sami let me in his life.
I'm not convinced at all.

This will never be accepted by the staff of the Office.
Do you have shoes of my size?
How many kids are in this class?

He's been away from college for six years.

Sami was planning on suicide.
Ask Tom about this.
I just got your card.
Give it to him.
What's your purpose in visiting this country?

Stop sammy.
Sami had a friendship with Lily's friends.
Who are these shoes?
Details are not important.
Last night was cold.
She looks younger than she is.
I wonder if Tom would like to feel like Mary.
Sami wanted to focus on his study.
Is he a teacher?
On the basis of my own experience, I believe that the partnership between America and Islam must be based on the truth of Islam rather than on what is not Islam, and I see in that part of my responsibility as President of the United States to address negative stereotypes about Islam wherever it appears.

I can't hear you guys.
Were you in school at that time?
"Nobs, if you kill 25 people, they must have been nobs."
She doesn't like sushi.
Tom's gone.
I have to go to sleep.
What did Tom do?
All Tom really needed was something to eat.
Tom's a debtman.
Don't tell me you're jealous because nobody's gonna believe it.
Tom's wounds seem dangerous.
Where's Monday?
He likes adventure.
If you need money, I'll ask my father.
Thank you so much for inviting me.
Excuse me.

The difference between me and them is big in length.
We'll get married someday.
Do you know if he's gonna be at the party?
Smy's married to a Muslim girl.
We just have to explain why.
Unfortunately, I was busy yesterday and couldn't do it.
Hey, easy for you to go.
You think so?
I've heard of a sammy and healthy night.
What happened in the club?
Sami went to get the water for the night.
You're wrong about that.
My account's a traitor.
Tom traveled a lot last year.
What can I say? What Kiev's doing is telling her, don't bother Bina to wake up!

Sami calls at night.
I'm sure he'll do it.
The book is here.
I have two dogs, one white and the other black.
Welcome home.
Would you lower the sound of the TV?
As for calm in the room, only an old voice can be heard.
There are at least 30 students in our class.
What do you want to drink?
But I don't want to.
Wait, Sammy until Lily comes back.
Sami could even have been friends with a rock.
Sami Lening went about the tenth hour.
I don't know when I'll be back exactly.
That's great!
We became friends right away.
I'll get some coffee.
This was the last photo of Sami.
Let's take a picture as a memory.
I wore her coat and then I went out.
The bus will be launched in five minutes.
When do you usually sleep?
Mary spoke in Japanese slowly.
That's our books.
They treated me so badly.
What are the rewards?
Lily was losing her blood quickly.
The new girl was very successful.
I took a cry.
When John Rivers expressed her support for Israel, she did not show any sympathy when asked about the greedy debtors who were killed by hundreds.

I'm his friend and I'm staying.
Do you see what I mean?
You have to help him, and quickly.
Please let me know of Tom.
Do you like it or not?
You look stupid.
I met night with friends of Sami.
I need an e-mail.
He did what he promised to do.
The separatists are trying to develop a false narrative in order to justify their political project.
Thank you for inviting me to the party.
She doesn't hate you, Tom.
He was a teacher who always loved me.
How many times do I have to repeat that?
It's too dangerous for you to be here.
Never mentioned this to me.
I'm done with that unsavory relationship.
Huya closes his eyes so he can drink.
Sami took his clothes off.
Hurry up.
I haven't finished my duties yet.
Many governorates suffered from hurricane losses.
