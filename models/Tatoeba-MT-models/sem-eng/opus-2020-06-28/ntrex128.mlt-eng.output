AMs from Wales fear to "be seen as foolish"
There is a composition among some AMs following a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was raised by plans to change the name of the Welsh Parliament assembly.
The AMs around the political spectrum are concerned that this will make them look radical .
AM Labour said that his group was concerned that "it has the same sound as Twp and Pwp."
For readers from outside Wales: In the Welsh tup language means ibleh and pwp means shot.
AM of Plaid said that the whole group was unhappy and suggested alternatives.
A observer from Wales said that his group had "open mind" on the name change, but noted that there was a small verbal difference from MWP to "Muppet".
In this context the letter and in the Welsh language will be presented in a similar manner to the composition of the letter and.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce changes in its name, said: "The final decision on any description of what should be called Members of the Assembly will naturally be the issue of the members themselves."
The Act of the Welsh Government of 2017 empowered the Wales assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that had broad support for the assembly to be called the Wales Parliament.
On the issue of the title of the AMs, the Commission favoured Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but MWP received the highest support in a public consultation.
Apparently, AMs are suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching consensus can be a headache for the Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the way the assembly works, including rules on the disappointment of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on the issue of how they should be called when holding a debate on legislation.
In Macedonia leave public opinion in a referendum on change in the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia."
The popular vote was established with a view to finding a solution to a long-standing dispute with the neighbouring country Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern name represents .
The President of Macedonia Giorge Ivanov, an opposer of the Parliament on the change in name, said that he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in name is simply the consequence of entry into the EU and NATO.
St.Martin's Letts Stop Playing as Churches in Harlem Are Sending
" Historically, the elderly I spoke to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr Adams.
"Today, there is no."
He said that he could understand how the bars went.
He said, "People socialize differently" today.
"The bars are no longer the centre of local activity where people go on a regular basis."
As for churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders think, "and today or tomorrow will end where they were at first."
He added that churches can be replaced with apartment blocks with condoms filled with the kind of people who will not help the rest of the local residents.
"The vast majority of people who buy condoms in these buildings are white-carved," he said, "and thus, they will not be able to relax when the day comes for these churches because it is very likely that many of these people who enter these condoms will not become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by congregations of whitebirds before Harlem became a metropolis of whitebirds - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's ten years later.
The original Metodist Congregation of White Carnival People left in the years 30.
A group of black caravan people who were practicing religion nearby took the title to the building.
St. Martin's was taken by a congregation of blackbirds under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who conducted a retailer's boat at 125 Street, a main road for buying in Harlem, who maintained the rent to or the promotion of black cartels.
Fire in 1939 left the building with serious damage, but as soon as the Fakher Johnson parishes made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Faher Johnson's and successor of St. Martin's, was proud when he called the carillon "the children of the people."
The expert who hit the carillon in July called him another challenge: "Cultural treasure" and "a unique historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that she was the first carillon in the world to have a black carnivorous musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who led to the largest carilon in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not change with anyone else.
What happened in St. Martin's over the last few months has been a complicated history of peri and contractors, some of whom have been admitted by the leaders of the laity church, others from the Episcopal diocesis.
The ‘vestry’ - the governing body of the parish, made up of laity leaders - wrote the diocesy in July with concern that the dioce "will seek to pass the costs” on to the survey, although the survey was not involved in connecting the experts and contractors who had drawn from the diocesy.
Some parishors complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocesis.
The sea dog hurts a 13-year-old boy while still for lobster in California
A boy attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was climbing for the lobster in California on the day of the opening of the season of the August, the officers said.
The attack took place shortly before the 7th morning where Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammeel said to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was standing with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and then went to a group to help draw them out of the water.
Hammeel said that for the first time he thought that it was the excitement of having followed to catch an awist, but then said he realized that he was crying, 'Gimni!
Get me!'
Cut him down and opened the whole club," Hammel said that he realized the moment he came to where the child came.
"Try to get everyone out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!" added Hammeel.
They took the child by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where she is in critical condition.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
The Lifegaard Capt. Larry Giles said in a meeting with the media that the sea dog was lost in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
Officials closed access to the beach by Ponto Beach in Kasbalad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered hazardous.
The safety plans's entering into the United Kingdom's beauty market
Sainsburi's are competing against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with scales of scales similar to those of ‘department store’ of beauty products equipped with specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial market entry of the UK’s €2.8 billion in beauty, which continues to grow while the sale of clothing and household goods is decreasing, the larger corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 shops around the country and the idea will be spread to more shops next year if it is successful.
Investment in beauty came after the supermarkets were looking for ways to use the space on the once-used bands for TVs, microwaves and goods for domestic use.
Sainsburi's said that it will double the amount of the beauty items that are offering up to 3000 items, including firms such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
According to the Court of Justice of the European Union, the Commission considers that there is a need to establish whether the measures in question constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty and whether they constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.
The Supermarket will also relaunch the range of its Boutique makeup so that the majority of products are fit for vegans - something that is increasingly called for by smaller buyers.
In addition, the retailer of Fragrance Shop will examine concessions in two Sainsburi's shops, which first opened in Croydon, London below, last week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and changing to buy small amounts of food daily in local convenience shops means that supermarkets are going to have to do more to persuade people to buy from there.
Mike Coupe, executive head of Sainsburi's, said that shops will appear increasingly like 'department stories' as the supermarket chain tries to fight against shops that account for the prices of Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
According to the Court of Justice, the State aid granted to ASI and AOE in breach of Article 107(1) of the Treaty is incompatible with the internal market and is incompatible with the internal market.
The previous attempt by the Supermarket to renew its beauty and arm's length departments failed.
Sainsburi's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the link ended after a fight on how to share the revenue from the pharmacist's shops in its supervisory authorities.
The new strategy was introduced after Sainsburi's selling the brokerage business with 281 shops to Celecio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for â12 million, three years ago.
He said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury skin care firms including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul from the Hicks, the business director of Sainsburi's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
The range of our firms has been designed to be appropriate to any need and the environment that attracts you and convenient shopping positions mean that we have become a destination of the beauty products of interest that challenges the old way of buying."
Peter Jones 'very angry' after playing Willoughby cancels a €11 million agreement
The personality of Dragos Den Peter Jones is "very angry" after TV TV presenter Willoughby cancelled a €11 million agreement with his lifestyle firm business to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time for the household product firm and accessories thereof, Truly.
The peer business was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's firm, Goop.
The presenter of The Morning, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce that she will leave.
Since Willoughby has left the personality of Dragos" Den Peter Jones very angry because it cancelled from being part of their business of a lifestyle firm that makes a lot of money in the last minute - to focus on its big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was "very angry" when the popular television personality admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his enroute business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, whose new agreements - with a value of up to €1.5 million - meant that she did not have enough time to dedicate it to their brand of household products and accessories, Truly.
The business was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow Goop's firm and was thought to double the estimated wealth of Willoughby of €11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, she appeared on Instagram to announce that she would leave Truly, Jones left Britain and went to one of his private pilgrims.
The source said: "Truly was by far the first priority of win.
It would have been her long-term future that would fill her with the next few decades.
Its decision to leave has left everyone completely disappointed.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was almost here.
There is a full store produced in Marlow headquarters which is ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of The Morning, which is among the profit-earning personalities of the Great Britain, could mean a cost for the company of millions due to a large investment in consumer goods from footwear and candles to clothing and household products, and the potential for further delays until its launch.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three children, Willoughby and her widow Dan Baldwin have been well friends with Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52, came with them as Chairman Chairman Chairman in March.
In this respect, the Commission considers that the measure is compatible with the internal market and that it is incompatible with the internal market.
Willoughby will become a M&S firm ambuctoise and replace An'm McPartlin as a presenter of I'm A Celebrity of ITV.
Last night, a nearby source of Jones said, "We don't comment on his economic affairs."
Meeting difficult but then we found love
He was impressed by criticism that would come from the news media for making a comment that some people consider "non-presidential" and because it was so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with a voice that imitates that of a "representer of news".
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump announced that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But denuclearisation negotiations stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the best North Korean diplomat, Ri Young Ho, told world leaders, on Saturday, at the General Assembly, that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States for the early steps of North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, the US continues with the sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view of his presentation.
He said, "We're going well with North Korea."
"We would have entered into war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have this very good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - the end of rocket tests, aid in the release of hostages and the return of the remaining American patients back home.
And he defended his unusual approach while talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out who are trying to enter this arena filled with people, we had about 200 people standing there," said Trump, he and him pointing directly to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and Terremot in Indonesia Destroying Island, Killing People's Deaths
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not required.
Even after more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had to move from home, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalysing international aid.
"Suddenly, in many cases, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it is challenging," said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organising a team to travel to Palu, it is unclear whether foreign staff can operate on the ground.
Mr. Sotopo, national disaster agency speaker, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Pale to see whether international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Taking into account the frequently occurring earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still not well prepared for the great anger of nature.
While shelter from the tsunami has been built in Aceh, it does not see them very well along the coast.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning serene in Palu, despite the warning issued, is likely to have contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best times, travel between the numerous islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complex.
A hospital visit was posted in Lombok for the care of the victims on his way to Palu, but it will last at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of the infrastructure that is falling in pieces of Indonesia, the centre of his electoral campaign, and spending a lot of money on roads and trains.
But Mr Joko's administration has given up because of the lack of funds as soon as he faces his election again next year.
Mr Joko is also faced with pressure from septic tensions still in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a more conservative form of this faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to move from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the road, using ‘machetes’, bows and arrows and other types of weapons.

Eventually, the ball came down after Cape Arizabaga, which went beyond trying to welcome him, and fell into the net.
"I was trying to enter that position, to get into the ball and players like Shaq always send it as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturiridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kent coming on me and touched the ball once and I didn't think much of it and tried to shoot the ball."
Chelsea were winning 1-0 to half the game after bringing 'goal' in 25 minutes from the very good Belgian player Eden Hazard.
The Chelsea hunter distributed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before leaving it going to the middle of the plain and then quickly entered the middle of Liverpool.

The number of deaths in Indonesia's tsunami rises to 832
The number of deaths in Indonesia tsunami rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people have been reported caught under the debris of the building that fell because of the 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused high waves up to 20 ft, said a speaker from the Sotopo Purwo Nugroho agency at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was full of buildings that fell.

The status of the Parliament of Crowell becomes the last monument affected by the argument about the ‘rewrite of history’.
Its removal would be an appropriate form of justice for the destruction similar to that of the Taliban, of many of the British religious and cultural works carried out by its fantastic followers.
But the Cromwell Society has described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "protective" and "intriguing to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statutes that Oliver Crowell's figure outside the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The ‘iconoclasm’ of the British civil war was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Crowell would have been sacrificed to the actions of his Thomas antate in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of an opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of the parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
If this is a fully accurate representation, it is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-century conflict of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure that is recognised as representing one side of that divide.
Its achievements as 'Lord Protection' also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated."
Bacterial Attacking and Killing Chinese Change
He was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in south-east China, according to local media reports.
The man, only identified with his name "Yuan," was found dead by a cut altar, covered with blood near the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post.
Pig farmers prepare to inject vaccines in pigs in ‘hoggery’ on 30 May 2005 in Xing of Qinghai Province, China.
Supposedly, he traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found a dead man, and discovered a door to the pig brows in the vicinity of the open.
He said there was a bleeding pig in his mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had attacked and killed the farmer, according to the report.
"The cogs' legs were bloody and mutilated," said the cousin, who referred to him by his name, "Wu," as quoted by the Guyang Eventing News.
The security camera videos showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday morning 4.40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was not of Yuan’s or of his chin.
Market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to not attack anyone else, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for its death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking people have previously been registered.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachustus, and the man was severely injured.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig had kept a farmer from Wales with his tractor until the animal had evicted his wife.
After the pigs of a farmer from Oregon attacked him and ate him in 2012, a farmer from Mantoba Farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the blood taste can act as a "cause."
"You're playing.
They repent, they are very curious... do not intend to hurt you.
Only you want to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The remains of the Uragan Rosa will bring a severe drought in the south-east of the United States
As predicted, the Uragan Rosa is weakening as it travels on the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring a flood rain around northern Mexico and south-east of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa brought a wind of 85 mph, a Category 1 Uragan, on 5th morning at the time of the east of Sunday, and was located 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is forming a ‘trouble’ on the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa is approaching the Bay California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will start pushing strong tropical moisture in a north-west direction to the south-west of the United States
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture that interacts with the ‘tough’ that is approaching creates a severe storm in the south-east in the coming days.
Locally, from 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous rapid floods, flows of residues and possible desert valanges.
A strong tropical motherhood will cause rain rates to close from 2 to 3 inches per hour in parts, especially in parts south of Nevada and Arizona.
From 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in parts of the South-West, especially on most of the Arizona.
The rapid flooding is possible under conditions which rapidly deteriorate due to the widespread character of the tropical rain.
It would be a good idea to come out in the desert by walking with the threat of tropical rain.
A heavy rain can cause the canyons to become dangerous rivers and the storms will cause winds to blow many local and dust.
The ‘trough’ will bring some rain for parts of the southern coast of California.
A total rain of more than half an inch may be possible, which may cause small flow of bricks and sliding roads.
This would be the first rain of their rainy season region.
Some floods of scattered tropical rain begin to move to Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more scattered late Monday and Tuesday.
A strong crop is spread in Four Corners on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October there may be a strong temperature change across the United States as the Arctic cools, but tropical areas remain rather hot.
This sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There will be a great example of dramatic temperature differences from the United States Center on Sunday.
There is almost a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Mississippi, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to develop and expand.
A large part of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a hot start in October with temperatures in the 80ths spread from the Southern plains to parts of the North-East.
New York City can rise to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is approximately 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast is indicating high possibilities for temperatures above the average for the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people saw very interesting witnesses on Thursday of the nominated candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaug and the woman who accused him of having committed a sexual attack allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christine Blasley Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political struggle continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming with the shocking news of the last minute of Friday: an agreement drawn up by the Senator of Arizona justice Fake to the FBI to conduct a week's investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that it is 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh basah when under the influence of alcohol and tried to remove the clothes when they were post-secondary school-level feasts.
Kavanaugh, in evidence of passion, said that he was 100 percent sure that it did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday saw it.
the company was counting the average amount of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks which they showed, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually finds difficulty calculating how many viewers from offices are.
To put it in perspective, it is a similar audience size to that for the decisive game of football or for the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinioners strongly supported the appointment of Kavanogh, was at the forefront of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewer during the hearing that lasted a whole day, said Nielsen.
ABC was just following it with 3.26 million viewer.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Fake was the central figure in the daytime drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement voting in favour of Kavanaugh, those protesting by the cameras of CNN and CBS were caught on the weekend and were shouting with him as he tried to get up in the lift for a hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He remained standing with his eyes looking down for several minutes as he was being aggressively criticised, in direct broadcasting on CNN.
"Stay standing here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think it's telling the truth to a country?
They said, "You have power when many women have nothing."
Flake said that his office issued a statement and said, before closing the lift doors, which will have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcasting networks were broadcast directly, hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance the designation of Kavanaugh for the Senate in full for a vote.
But Flake said that he would do so only with the understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the designated person the following week, that the Democratic minorities have been encouraging.
Fake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and several years later, Flake took his decision.
Flake's decision had power, as it was evident that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanogh.
The English Prime Minister May accuses critics who are "take advantage of the policy" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of their plans to leave the European Union that are "take advantage" of the policy and undermine national interest in interviewing the newspaper Sunday Times.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May came to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former minister for foreign affairs Boris Johnson pressed his attack of the so-called ‘Chequers Plan’ for Brexit, and said that a proposal that the Great Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was ‘completely protected’.
The shooting at Wyde Sims: The police arrested the suspect Dayton Simpson after the death of LSU's player
The police arrested a suspected gunman who killed Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player of LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on a second-degree murder charge, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The officers issued a protest film between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the field and said that they found Simpson's DNA on them, reporting the CBS’s affiliated, WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that they admitted that they had shot and killed Wade.
Its bond was set at $350,000, reporting the Advocate.
He issued a preliminary report on Friday, which said that the cause of death is damage from a crystal from the head to the neck.
The department is granting credit to the police force of the Luisiana State Police College, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the University Police Police and the citizens of the area to assist in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The director of LSU Joe Alleva's ethics thanked the enforcement of the area's law for "a due diligence and search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The attacker who was 2 metres long, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
It had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 'rebounds' each game in the past season.
Friday morning, the basketball coach of the LSU Will Wade said that the team is "lost" and "under shock" after the death of Wade.
"This is what worries him all the time," said Wade.
Vulcan discards ash on Mmexico city
Wastes being disposed of by the vulcan Popocatepetl reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crate had increased and 183 emissions of gas and ash had been recorded within 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring several tectonic sounds and movements.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash that cost car windscreens in the vicinity of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geography psychologists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) south-east of capital after an earthquake of 7.1 in the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The so-called "Don Goyo" volcano has been active since 1994.
Police have a conflict with separates from Catalan before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent demonstrators had a conflict with the anti-rival police, and as thousands joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catholic polarisation vote on the coup.
A group in favour of the segregated segregators who were kept back from the anti-vell police threw their eggs and dust paints, and created a cloud of dark dust on the roads which are usually filled with tourists.
There were also small fightings during the day and the police had to use the tubes to control the fighting.
Over a period of several hours, groups in favour of independence were calling out "Not to forget, not to forgive" to fight against unionists who were crying, "Spain Forever."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries they received in the protests, reported the local picture.
Tensions remained high in the region which wants independence one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by Madrid but which is celebrated by segregators from Catalonia.
The voters chose a huge gap to become independent, although participation was low with those against the parting that made a big bill against the vote.
According to the authorities of Catalan, nearly 1000 people were turned over last year after the police tried to stop voting in the voting stations throughout the region in violent fighting.
Independence groups were camped during the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different course.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electricist who attended the separate protest with his wife said that he no longer hoped in the prospects that Catalon would gain independence.
"The other year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw Mom and Dad crying with joy that they could vote but now alone," he said.
Although they had a vital and narrow victory in the regional elections last December, parties in favour of the independence of the Catalonian are sending to keep the momentum this year with many of their best leaders known either in the exile they have decided to themselves or in detention and are waiting for the process because of their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
According to a report from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, he was a member of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.
"There is more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of Catalon who is in prison before the process since the end of last year, announced that he would contest the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"By going out as a candidate for the European elections it is the best way to condemn the trend in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car entered a healthy house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car entered the home of Londonerry more than once.
The incident took place in Blynagard Crescent on Thursday for the battle of 19:30 BST.
Investigative inspector Bob Blemmings said that the injury was caused to the grades and buildings themselves.
It has also been used ‘crossbow’ to shoot the car at some point.
Goal' of Mengna wins 1-0 game for Livingston against Ringers
First 'Goal' of Dolly Meninga's for Livingston won the game
Livingston, which has been promoted, blubbered the Ringers and thus Steven Gerard lost for the second time only in 18 games as a coach of the ‘cub’ of Ibrox.
The sparkling of the Dolly Mengna's ball made all the difference as Gary Holt's side was equal in the points with Hibernian in the second place.
The Gerard side has not won once out of its round in Premiership in this season and the next Sunday will play against Hearts, which first came first and followed by eight points.
Before that game, Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna in their round in Europa League on Thursday.
While Livingston continues not to have a loss in division in six games, with the Holt main coach that has not yet revealed a game since he came instead of Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against loose visitors
Holt's team has long been winning before he had a ‘goal’, with his direct style of games that was causing many problems for Ringers.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but distributed the ball in front of the lat, then Alan Lithgow could only distribute the ball with a wide body after he slid to get to receive the ball from Craig Halkit at the Lasta.
Those who were playing in their own crowd were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, because they knew that visitors could have taken the problems at certain moments.
And that was how the "goal" came crucial.
Ringers let 'free-kick' come in and Lingston took the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to help Meninga, who touched the ball and entered into the latrine from the centre of the box.
Until that moment, Rangers were dominated by the ownership of the ball, but they were finding the defence of the team they were playing in their own neck, not penetre, and the ‘goalkeeper’ Liam Kelly had little trouble,
That style of games continued even in the second half of the game, but Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to host the ball.
Scott Pittman failed to find a ‘goal’ because of the ‘goalkeeper’ of the Langers godn McGregor and Lithgow widely shot the ball after they distributed him another Lingston player.
Balloons were all the time in the Livingston box and were always removed from their players, while two requests for ‘penalty’ - after Halkit's attempt on Glenn Middleton's replacement, and one after the ball was touched by the hands of a player - were rejected.
Livingston phenomena — analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland inside Arena Tony Macaroni
Performance and phenomenal result for Livingston.
For a man, they were excellent, they continued to exceed the expectations of this up-up journey.
The style of the games and their staff did not change much from the return to the main fight, but the most credit should go to Holt for the way he joined the team since he arrived.
He had a lot of hero.
The head Halkit was very big in his games, by organising a well-organized defence immensity, while Minnga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Wall with seven eyes.
However, Rangers had a lack of inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at certain moments under Gerard, there was a lack of standards recently.
Their last chance with the ball was not good - once they just managed to break up the defence of the team that was playing in his own neck - and it is a sign for the Ringers, who find themselves in the middle of the class.
Erdogan received different reactions in Cologene
On Saturday (29 September) there were people laughing and a blue sky as the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – with a view to repairing the relations between NATO allies.
They did not agree on issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne to open a huge new movie.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The Police quoted security reasons to block a large crowd of 25,000 people from being gathered before the Moscow, but many of his supporters came close to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan - many of them Kurdi - also heard their voices, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome them to the country.
The opposing protests reflect the separation of a visitor who is heroic to certain German Turkish and believed to be ‘autocrrat’ from others.
Roadblock in Deptford: Cyclists dies in collision with a car
A Cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic route in Deptford, south-east of the city, to the collision of 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and attended the para-medical, but the man died on the spot.
This collision occurred a few months after another cyclist died after he hit a car and continued to go to Childers Street, around a distance from last Saturday's collision.
The Metropolitan Police said that the officials were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and bus deviations are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officials are in disorder.
Six prison officers were put to death following a disorder in a high-security male prison, told by the Prison Office.
The disorder started in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire for the 09:30 BST collision on Sunday and is ongoing.
Specialised officials "Tornado" have been introduced to address the disorder, which involves eight prisoners and is contained in one of the sections.
Officials have been treated for minor injuries to their face on the ground.
Prison Service speakers said: "A special trained prison staff has been deployed to address an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of those who committed the most dangerous crimes in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year anti-wave officers were called to prison to address a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with ‘pool’ balls.
Uragan Rosa Threatened to Phenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake city in the Flood of Malta (Nixa Areas can benefit)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week as the remaining energy of the Uragan Rosa goes south-west of the desert, leading to rapid flood risks.
The National Temple Service has already established a rapid flood watch for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona to South and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including the cities of Phenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line from Phenix on Tuesday, and approach late Monday with the rain.
The Phenix National Temporal Service noted in a table that "only ten tropical cycles have maintained a status of tropical storm or depression at a distance of 200 miles from Phenix since 1950"!
Katarina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of 40 miles from the AZ border."
The latest models of the National Research Centre predict from 2 to 4 inches of rain, with amounts isolated to up to 6 inches in the Arizona Mogollon Rim.
Other South-West Desert areas including central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to have up to 2 inches, with possible isolated totals of up to 4 inches.
For those at risk of rapid flooding, Rosa's rain can be positive as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this weather is likely to be beneficial as the South-West is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the dryer, just over 40 per cent of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme drought, second highest category," reported byweather.com.
First, the route of Uragan Rosa has been delivered to follow the Mexican Bay of California.
Rosa, who will still be a very strong hurricane the following Sunday morning with a maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, will be located 385 miles south of Point Eugenia, Mexico and move north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting colder waters in the Pacific and therefore loses power.
It is therefore expected to touch Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoons or early evenings.
The rain in parts of Mexico can be strong, creating a significant flood risk.
"A total rain of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Bay California to the north-west of Sonora, with a possibility of not more than 10 inches," reported byweather.com.
Then Rosa will move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then she will move from Arizona and south to Utah until late in the evening on Tuesday.
"The main danger expected by Rosa or its residues is a very heavy rain in Baya California, in the north-west of Sonora, and in the south-west desert of the United States," said the National Centre of Uruguay.
This rain is expected to produce life-threatening rapid floods and spills into deserts, and mountain valanges.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested after attempted murder
Three adolescents and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after the discovery of a 16-year-old adolescent with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage child was found injured in Excelsior Terace in the Midsomer Norton area for the 04:00 BST collision on Saturday.
Take him to the hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
Adolescents 17 years old, two 18 years old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the area of Radstock, Avon, said the Somerset Police.
Officials appealed to anyone who could have a video taken from the mobile phone of what had happened to talk.
Trump said that Kavanaugh ‘sends and anger’ of the Democratic Party
"Vot for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the unmerciful and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump during a demonstration in Weeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh ‘send away the others and the anger’ of the Democratic Party during his designation process.
Kavanaugh witnessed to the Congress on Thursday, with power and emotion rejected an allegation by Christine Blassey Ford that he sexually attacked her decades ago when they were adolescents.
Ford also witnessed during the hearing on her allegation.
Saturday, the President said that, at that time, the "American people saw the bravature and the quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"Vot confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a vote which confirms to one of the most modern legal brains, a lawyer with an impressive public service record", he told the crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the designation of Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of our Republic's participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
Who I do not challenge, but in truth, I am challenging," he said.
"This is why I am running everywhere to fight for very good candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats have a mission to "resist and hinder."
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on the designation of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, said a senior management assistant of the GOP to CNN.
Hundreds killed by the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with the apparent increasing number of deaths
At least 384 people were killed, many were injured as a huge wave fell strongly on shores, after a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesis, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when high waves up to six metres (18 feet) fell strongly on the ground when it began to darken, while many were injured and killed and destroyed everything that was in the middle.
Tsunami occurred after a strength earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not rise up to run immediately and end up victims," said Sutoto Puro Nugroho, the speaker for the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB during brewing in Jap.
"The tsunami did not arise alone, attracted cars, logs, houses, hit everything that was there on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled along the open sea with speeds of 800 km (497 mph) before the shore.
Some people went up trees to escape the tsunami and kept alive, he said.
About 16,700 persons were evacuated to 24 centres in Pallu.
Photos released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, bridges surrounding themselves and fell and mosque surrounded by water.
Strong scoxy continued to promise the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated in the statement that the energy generated by the massive weekly earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
They said that the city's geography, located at the end of a long, narrow beach, could have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "excessive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, business centres and hotels had fallen.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the construction of a building that fell, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that casualties and damage could be larger along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Dongakal, which is closer to the centre of the earthquake.
Communications "were totally sent and without information" by Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were going to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but you can get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticised because he did not know that tsunami hit Palu, although officials said that the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
A man on the upper wall of a building may be heard in a video of the shared chat rooms on social media, calling out anxious warnings to the tsunami that was approaching people on the lower road.
Within a few minutes a huge amount of water fell heavily on the shore, carrying buildings and cars with it.
The videos could not be authenticated immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe light breach that reduced communications around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The authorities said that the military had started sending cargo planes with the aid from Japhar and other cities, but the evacuations still needed food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city has only been reopened for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
It was scheduled that President Joko Widodo would visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths well exceeds 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While the staff of World Vision's from Dongagala have come to the city of Palu, where employees are sheltered, tarpolin shellers have been mounted at the entrance of their office, they have passed from where scenes of destruction are on their way there, said Mr. Doseba.
He said, "I have seen a lot of houses destroyed."
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups started the unpleasant process of disaster aid, a few complained about the fact that foreign aid workers with deep competences were not allowed to travel to Pallu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and personnel from abroad can only start if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"For a state-of-the-provincial disaster," said Aulia Arani, an Indonesian Red Cross speaker.
"Since the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can introduce international assistance but so far there is no status."
On the second night in Palu following the earthquake and the Friday tsunami, the friends and family of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that inspired this history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy came out of a sewage.
On Sunday, people who carried out rescue released a woman who was caught under the crush for two days near her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian national pargliding team coach, had trained two of the missing paragliders for Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Other caught in the Roa Road Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
"As a superior person in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional weight," he said.
Mr Gendon told how, in the hours after the news that the Roa Roa Lukanda had fallen, circulated among the paragliding community, he sent messages in a manner, desperately, with WattsApp to Palu's competitors, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, only marked that they had left, but did not mark that they had arrived.
"I think that what means the messages did not come," he said.
Hallin takes $26,750 while ATM was refilled in Newport on the Levee

The driver of the car was cancelling ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was busy with his job, another man "is running from behind the Brick's employee" and stole a money bag intended for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses saw many suspects escape the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities shall contact the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rap channel changes its name for Ye
The mayor of the rap Kanye West is changing his name - for Ye.
While announcing the change in Twitter on Saturday, he said: "The man who was formerly known as Kanye West"
West, 41, has been vaccinated Ye for some time and used the monitor as the title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change takes place before his appearance on Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yanday.
He replaces the channel Ariana Grande on the programme that was cancelled for "emotional reasons," said the programme creator.
In addition to being an aberration of his current professional name, West before he said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible means 'you,' said West earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with the radio presenter Big Boy.
"So I am, you, I am, it is, we.
From Kanye which means ‘the only one’, to Ye only - just a reflection of what we have good, bad, what we mix, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
It is one of a number of famous rap singers who changed their name.
San Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Didy, but this year announced that he would prefer the names Love and Brother Love names.
As one who collaborated with West, JAY-Z, it is also shared with or without capital letters.
MALO of Mexico promises not to use the military against civilians
The elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloodshed against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Cup that "you will never use the military to restrict the Mexican people."
The troops sped on peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when movements of the left students were being established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support Mexican youths by granting monthly subsidies to those who study and open more public universities free of charge.
He said that unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
The US should double the funds for I.A.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in this field, says the investor and practitioners of the IA Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after several parts of the US government made IA notices, even if there is no formal IA strategy in the US.
In the meantime, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be the first in IA innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for IA research would be a good start, as all other countries are much behind the US, and we are looking for the next revolutionary step in the IA," said Lee.
Duplication of funds can double the possibilities that the next major IA achievement will take place in the USA, Lee told CNBC at an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Supervisors: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent IA companies in China, Facebook+.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegue Mellon, he worked on an IA system that won the player with the highest rating of American Othello, and then he was executive with Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee has recognised former US government competitions in technology such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Project Agency and asked when it will be the next one, to help identify the next visitors.
Lee said that researchers in the US often have to work a lot to take government grants.
Lee said, "It is not China that is removing academic leaders; the corporates are doing so,"
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have employed people who inspire others from universities to work on the IA.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to strengthen their efforts in the IA.
He said, "I believe that green paper should be offered automatically to people who have a Doctor in the IA".
The State Council of China issued the next Land-based Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funds to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organisations issue money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
More than a year later, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Artistic Intelligence Centre, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of an Selected Artistic Intelligence Committee.
And last month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As regards the NSF, they currently invest over $100 million a year in IA research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation which tried to create a National Security Commission on Artistic Intelligence did not see any action in several months.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia," a step that resolves a long-standing dispute with Greece which had blocked its membership offers for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of the town in its northern region represents a possibility of possession of its territory and has made a veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments arrived in an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but national opponents argue that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the population of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and a boat campaign raised doubts as to whether participation would reach the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote is read: "You are in favour of membership in NATO and in the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Those who support the change in name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to enter into bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries that have escaped the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, sufficient members of the parliament said that they would respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change in name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I was to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Giuseppe Tanevski, 62, a voteman in capitals, Skypeje.
The PM of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country which gives him the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Scopeje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, he was arming a small palk and preparing seats in front of the armed bands by those who will make a referendum bog.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we have to enter proudly under our conditions, not with someone else's orders" said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If we do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after he voted.
He said that a result in favour of changing the name would be "confirmation of our future."
A two-year survey last published by the Institute for Research of the Policy of Macedonia said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum - an amount under that of participation required.
Another survey, carried out by a TV TV in Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, participation should be 50 per cent and one more votes.
If the referendum fails, it represents the first serious blow to government policy in favour of Western ideologies from the moment he took control of him in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, the player of Manchester City, passing through all of Brighton's defences for ‘goal’
Sergio Aguero and Rο Sterling broke Brighton's defence in victory 2-0 of Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his 'goal' in 65 minutes seemed very easy.
The attacker from Argentina received a ball from mid-radish at the beginning of the sequence.
Between three Brighton defenders before a wheel into a wide open space.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players with green bursts.
Fight one defender before fleeing much more than the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he distributed the ball on his left and found the Sterling.
The English attacker first touched the ball in the box to redistribute to Aguero, who used the right foot to insert the ball on the right side of the net by passing it from where the Brighton Mathew Ryan's goalkeper was.
"Aguero is giving some trouble on his feet," said the coach of City Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about the fact that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That is how it happened.
We had the good fortune that made a "goal" at that moment."
But it was Strling that gave the initial advantage to Sky Blues in the fight of Premier League.
That ‘goal’ occurred in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball deep inside the territory of Brighton in that action.
He brought the ball right to Leroy Sane with the left hand very nicely.
Sane touched the ball a little bit before leading to Sterling where the lasa.
The attacker of the Sky Blues touched the ball a little and put it into the net just before sliding into a territory that was not supposed to enter.
City will play against Hoffenheim at the stage of the Campions League groups at 122:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Shinheim, Germany.
Scherzer must play in apoiler vs. Rockies
Since Nationals were eliminated from the possibility of competing in the decisive game, there was no reason to make an effort to start it again.
But the players so competitive Scherzer expect to be the ‘pitcher’ on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that the Rockies have the possibility to play in the decisive game, which are in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West with one game.
The Rockies have achieved a possibility of continuing to compete with winning 5-2 against the Nationals this evening, but are still seeking the first title of the division.
"Unless we are playing for nothing, we may at least have the possibility to win by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be playing at the highest level of any point I can face this year.
What do you not want to compete in those circumstances?"
Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but they are allegedly inclined to let Scherzer be the ‘pitcher’ in such a situation.
Scherzer, who is starting for the 34th time, has had a practice session on Thursday and is playing as a pitcher on Sunday when he is generally resting.
The player from Washington playing right-hand play is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 'strikeout' at 220 2/3 'innings' in this season.
Trump’s manifestations in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation concerning the choice for his Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, speaking about the importance of the Republic's participation in the mid-term elections.
"In November, everything we've done will be threatened.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is very large -- I challenge, but in truth, I am therefore running everywhere to fight for very good candidates," he said.
"We see this very terrible and radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now," continued Trump.
And they are determined to take back power by using any means possible, you can see others.
He does not care about those who hurt them, those who want to fly to gain power and control, what they want, power and control, we will not give them."
He said that the Democrats have a mission to "resist and hinder."
"And I have seen it over the last four days," he said, and he was calling to the Democrats "reraged and green and dishonest and dishonest."
He referred to the Democratic Senator classified in the Committee of the Judiciary of the Senate of Diana Feinstein by her name, and received many negative voices from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Has the document been issued?
Uh, uh, what are you.
No, uh no, I expect, firstly the movements of her body were nothing positive - the worst movements I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad group.
Not tolerating the communicationer’s views
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to depress me, I didn't take it very seriously.
After all, I am the most recent MP in a list of the Labour Party that was not positively welcomed - because we have communicated our views.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she fought against anti-semitism.
In my case, the motion of censor criticised me because I did not agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, i.e., issues similar to those on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the majority of my eight years as a local MP Labour, the meetings of the General Council of the evening were exactly that way.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the policy promise "more gentle and gentle" has long been forgotten if, in fact, it has never started in the truth.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged as to whether it is acceptable for the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I thought that I had a similar political view began to expect me to change my understanding and take positions that I would never agree with in other situations - both on national security and on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and, in truth, do not make any difference – they follow me with an abuse of social media with a request to be removed from my office of MPs, denouncing the policy of the centre, and telling me that I do not have any part of the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Yes, I know that I have had more good luck than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I aim at the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face many sexual abuse or racism every day but never hide from comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that the levels of abuse have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad group and with any "unconfidence" or change in selection rules, the party becomes narrow.
I've been given many advice over the last two years that encouraged me to keep my opinions for me, not to be so voiced and then everything "be well."
But I didn't get involved in politics to do so.
Since my entry into the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, I have advocated the negligence of the government of Thatcher which has left my comprehensive school class literally in a disaster state, seeking to improve public services for those who need them most - both as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I never hid my policy, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been, in any way, confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would say that when the country is moving towards Brexit that will harm our families, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in truth, the only message that I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether or not members of the Labour Party: I am proud to work for you and I promise you that no amount of threats that are removed from my office or political ambition will deter us from acting in those that I believe are your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, not yet lost, uppers in grade
Two attempts could change a little the result, but there was no doubt that Ayr had ordered them to win this so exciting day's game of the Tenant's Premiership.
Currently, they are ranked first, the only team from all ten that have not been lost once.
Finally, it was the supreme defence, as well as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities, which helped the team, who was playing in his own race, wins, and the Peter Murchie coach had every right to be happy.
"We've had trials during our games so far, and we still don't miss one, so I'm happy," he said.
Robin Cristie of Melrose said: "Give Ayr credit, they have taken advantage of the best opportunities of us."
With the attempt of Grant Anderson's 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Clemo, Ayr were winning, but, yellow paper from the head of Scotland Roy Hughes, who was allowed to play the game by the Warors, gave Melrose the opportunity to try and Jason Bagot made an unconverted attempt.
Clemo extended Ayr's victory with ‘penalty’, before, in the middle of the exact game, made a ‘goal’ and an individual attempt conversion to make the points 17-5 for Ayr in the lot.
But Melrose started the second part of the game well and the attempt of Patrick Anderson's, converted by Bagot, reduced the gap by 5 points.
Then he stopped the game because of a serious injury of Ruaderh Knott, who came out of the crowd on a spray, and as soon as she started the game again, Ayr continued to bring the points after an attempt by Stafford McDowell, converted from Clemo.
Then, the head agent of Ayr Blairson was given a yellow paper, and again, Melrose came out with aggression when they made an unconverted attempt by Bruce Collvine, after a period of hard pressure.
However, the team that he was playing in his own crowd began to attack again, and when Stern Hutchinson was given a yellow card for action he took on Clemo without the ball, from the ‘penalty’ line, MacPherson touched the ball with the ground behind the Ayr group that was advancing.
Clemo agreed, as he once again did almost out of the area from which the game begins, after Kyle Rowe collected the ball that David Armstrong meetings from the box and sent to Gregor Henry, who plays on the side, for the fifth attempt of the side that she was playing in her own round.
The personality of Still Game seems to be ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The identity of Still Game Ford Kieran appears to be ready to enter the hospitality industry after it has been discovered that it has been designated as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man who makes the part of Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC programme, who he writes and participates in with his long-term colleague Greg Hemphyll.
The Doo announced that the next nine series would be the last of the programme, and it appears that Kieran is planning for his life after Craiglang.
According to the lists of official registers, he is the director of Adritmor Limited.
The player refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scott Sun's ideas that Kieran was seeking to engage in the "business of very good restaurants" of Glasgow.
'The sea is our': Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes that the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
Seafarers stay alert of the navigated naval headquarters with ropes and chains in La Paz.
Public buildings have an ocean blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is our right.
Recovering it is a duty."
Around Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of 19th-century resources remains clear - as Bolivians desire to be able to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is perhaps at its highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and harmony, and obviously awaits the result with a positive thought," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the ICJ on large screens all over the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find, in favour of the Bolivian statement, that – after decades of irregular talks – Chile is obliged to negotiate and give Bolivia sovereign stock to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's official president – facing a controversial battle for his election next year – also has much to lose in the decision of Monday.
"We are very close to getting access to the Pacific Ocean again," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia – and that little change would be made if it did so.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant the territory of Chile, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the judgment of the ICJ comes only six months after the final arguments have been heard, indicates that the case "was not complicated" said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from favouring the Bolivia case, the last four years may not have been helpful.
"The issue of access to the sea has been prevented by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
The hostile history of Morales weakened any residual goodwill of Chile, it suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will, at some point, continue to speak, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions thereafter.
Both countries have not shared ambassadors since 1962.
The former president of Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an "extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and "the opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who is still one of the most popular Latin American presidents - was using the maritime issue as political aid.
"Bolivia will never exceed its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can entrust the US
North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Young Ho says that his nation will never disarm nuclear weapons is the first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to carry out the promises they made at a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
Its comments are as soon as the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears to be on the way to relaunch the nuclear diplomacy that is more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Jong Un.
He says that it is "a hope in the void" that the ongoing sanctions and the United States objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will never force North Korea to give up.
Washington is concerned about whether it should agree with the declaration without Pyongyang making the first significant disarmament steps.
Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump want the second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is serious to renounce a weapon that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion scenes reveal the latest collection of material for the massive head that is just going to appear in the main shops.
If you want to add to your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you can stop looking.
The Valentino and Tom Browne designers revealed a range of strange and very big headwear for their spring and summer collection of 2019 on the runway that opened the style set in Paris Fashion Week.
Kipels are very unethical on this summer's Instagram and these designers have told their surprising reactions on the palk.
The article most notably highlighted that Valentino had called an extravagating beige with a broad edge similar to the feathers that completely covered the heads of the models.
Other very large-scale accessories included cheese coated with cheeses, annoyances and even ananas - but are not designed to keep your head warm.
Two Browne also revealed a choice of strange masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Most of the colored masks had the two lips encrypted and were more similar to Hannibal Lecter than ‘Haute couture’.
One reaction was like the device of the complete snorkel and goggles, while the other was like a mixture of wet ice cream.
And if you continue with this good style.
Those who follow the fashion predict that huge ‘bonnets’ will soon appear in the main shops.
The very big hats come out after the release of 'La Bomba', the white chapel with a wide edge of two hands that was worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratikawski.
The 'colt label' responsible for the appeal that is not practical is very visible on social media casts another big reaction on the palk - a straw bag that contains almost as much as the mala model it was carrying.
The dark orange-affeak basket, surrounded by the small sieve of the well and with a white skin grip, was the most prominent creation at the 2019 Jacquemus Spring and Summer collection in Paris Fassion Week.
A famous Stilist Luke Arminge said to FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and bags in the main shops for the coming summer--as the designer has made a huge impact, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for very large accessories.'
John Edward: Skills in languages essential to global citizens
The independent schools of Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another set of excellent examinations results, which is only strengthened with individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to give students and their parents the best level of service.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, for their chosen careers and for their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalised school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain subject to a popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, understand with his mind.
If you speak his own language, he understands with his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examinations, we can see that the languages are at the forefront of the classification tables with the highest rates of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages achieved higher grade A.
The data collected from the 74 schools that are members of the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students achieved higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students also achieved A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages are now, as a subject option, maintained in the same way as STEM topics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A UK Employment and Skills Commission survey in 2014 found that for reasons given by employers to be sending to fill job vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Irrespective of the career to choose, if you learn another language, it will have a real advantage in the future as it has the ability to stay in such a life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a multilingual person in the forefront of competition.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and, by 15 percent, French is the only language spoken with a two-digit percentage.
That is why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
Knowing more than one language, particularly those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding significant work.
In Scotland, each school will learn different languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages from which you can choose in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future.
It cannot currently be denied, in a global business environment, that languages remain very important for the country's future, and therefore this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the youth of Scotland.
The faut beni not faire.

On Sunday LeBron will play for the first time with the Luckers in San Diego
The sports supporters of LeBron James did not have much to expect to start for the first time for the Los Angeles Lacers.
The coach of the Lake Walton Luckers announced that James would play in the opening game before the start of the season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the amount of minutes he will play has yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of the Luckers.
Lacers Mike Trudell journalist wrote a note that, probably, James will play a limited amount of minutes.
Following the practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games schedule before the start of the Lakers season.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself," he said.
Trimp’s extenuation in West Virginia, YouTube Canal
President Donald Trump starts a wave of tonight's campaign manifestations in Weeling, West Virginia.
This is the first demonstration of Trump by five scheduled next week, including amicable stops including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote suspended for its option to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the forthcoming mid-term elections as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in Nova.
At a time is Trump's demonstration at West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
The demonstration of Trump in Weheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. day, Saturday, 29th September, 2018.
You can see the demonstration of Trump in West Virginia online below by direct broadcasting on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for the nomination of the Supreme Court of Trent Kavanaugh, which have become intense due to allegations of sexual misconduct with an early confirmation vote of the Senate suspended for up to one week while investigating the FBI.
But the primary objective of this wave of manifestations is to help the Republicans face the November elections to gain a little momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that these five demonstrations next week are aimed at "energying volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The Control of Congress is so important for this agenda that the president will travel as far as possible to the states as we can as we approach the season of the committed campaign," said the speaker of the Trump campaign, who reported that his name was mentioned.
Calendar for the Land of Wesbanco in Weheeling, tonight's display can gather supporters from "Ohio and Pensylvania and attract coverage from the media of Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump will be visiting West Virginia, the winning state with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate of the Republican Senate of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is losing out in the survey.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to boost him in the survey," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Cup Ryder 2018: The United States of America team determined not to give up while standing for Sunday singles
After three sessions on one side, the Saturday afternoon photomes could have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum of momentum is a fully invented sport concept but one that players really believe in, and never more than in such competitions.
So where do they say it is the momentum now?
"These were on the front with six points and now we are with four, so I think we're carrying this as a little momentum," said Jordan Speth as he left over the day.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, four front points with twelve more to be played.
Americans, say Spithah, feel but have a little difficulty and have a lot of encouragement, not at least the form of His and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each of them opens with three points from four.
His father was right from toe to green and is running with the example.
That cry from the heart of a celebration continued to grow as it continued its round, by making a crucial moment to bring the fourth game equal when he and Thomas were two below after two.
His boy who gave them the game on 15 was welcomed by a similar cry, the kind that tells you to believe that the American team is still there.
"Vera you want to go deep and worry about your own item," said Zeitah.
This is what each of these players has lost now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Speth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and play Fleetwood, the incontestable history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but sweet couple is four with four and considered perfect.
"Mollywood" were the only pair who didn't find bogie on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and nine after Friday morning.
That course, and the way their energy goes both to and from this living crowd sets out to be the players that are challenging Sunday, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun falls on Le Golf National from Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both on different holes.
But here we are talking about an early European glory.
Bobba Watson and Webb Simpson were quickly completed by Sergio García, the morning football hero, when he was put in parallel with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the nine front entered the Spanish and the Swedish into a hole that they had never been able to come near to get out of it.
But Sunday, there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and forssomes are very interesting to see closely because of peer-to-peer interactions, advice given, advice not to give and the way a strategy can be changed into a second.
Europe has therefore better played as a team and is in the lead on the final day, but this session of the focus has also shown that the US Team is determined that some, especially from the United States side, were questioning.
Europe in front with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take a good advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after it was released from the front-side football and fursomes parties by 10-6 on the US.
The inspired peer Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made the two-winning effort on Tinger Woods which found difficulty in taking their score so far in the National Gulf to four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, ready to hold the trophies that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American side that went wrong in morning football, which took the 3-1 series.
The US offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two parties, but could not reach the difference in score.
The side of Jim Furyk needed eight points from the 12 parties of one Sunday's play to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first new European for the season that won four consecutive points while he and Molinari, vaccinated "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are only the second pair who won four of their four opening parties in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After they dominated Woods and Patrick Red in football then worked excellently to win Woods that did not appear optimistic and the new American player for the Bryson Dechambeau season with even more hepatic score of 5&4.
Weuds, who found difficulty in both parties Saturday, showed occasional moments of friction but now has lost 19 of his 29 parties in the football and the feursomes and seven successively.
Justin Rose, out for morning volleyballs, returned to Henrich Johnson's partner in the foursomes for a loss of 2&1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - which are classified first and third in the world.
But not everything has been done as Europe desired on a beautiful day, with a bit of a gap in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a great winner for three times, and Justin Thomas set the threshold for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a bold victory of 2&1 on John Rahm and Ian Potter of Spain in the football and later returned to win Poulter and Roy McIllroy with 4&3 in the foursomes after losing both opening holes.
It was only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team returned from a four-point difference while he entered the singles, although Furyk side hollers need a worm to keep the trophies.
However, after being the second best for two days, against Sunday attack appears to be more than they can do.
North Korea says that "in no way" will be dismantled unilaterally without trust
North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations the Saturday that the ongoing sanctions were deepening its lack of confidence in the United States and that there was no way that the country would have left its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Young Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "measurable good will measures" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site, and promised not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the US," he said.
"With no confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances in no way will we disable ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri repeated family complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phases" approach to denuclearisation in which North Korea was rewarded as soon as it took gradual steps, his statement appeared significantly that it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation as it had done in the past.
Re-referenced to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a president of the United States who is serving his duties and leader of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work towards the ‘Korean pendulum denuclearisation’ while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea was looking for a formal end to Korea War 1950-53, but the United States said that Pyongyang would first have to give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also maintained calls to reduce tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearisation first" and increases the level of pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their objective in a cooperative manner, and also objects to the "declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can break is a dream of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our lack of confidence."
I did not mention plans for the second Kim-Trump summit that the US leader stressed at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the part of this issue of denuclearisation was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a block."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the continental land of the United States with North Korea rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Kaffi" Trump called Kim "a man of rockets" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened to "destroy completely" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take steps to dismantle, but said that much remains to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
Wednesday, Trump said that he did not have a timetable for this, saying, "If you take two, three or five months - do not make a difference."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Thursday, told the UN Security Council that: "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and without delay until we realize the fully and finally verified denuclearisation."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened the sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with the aim of stopping funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again this month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July while he said that progress had been made, after he criticised North Korea in a few hours for making "Gangster-like claims".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "corresponding measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students make a course on taking sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year succeeded in making all its students who have not yet graduated more sleep with the aim of fighting the growing macho culture of studying all night and remaining raised by caffeine.
Academy found that students in the first place in the world often have no idea about the true basic things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women Hospital, drew up the course, believing that he was the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he made a speech about the impact that sleeplessness had on learning.
"At last she was a girl on me and said, "Why are you saying this to me now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever said to her about the importance of sleep - which suppositors," she said to The Telegraph.
The course, which began for the first time this year, explains to students the essential things about how good sleeping traditions help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatric at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had serious insomnia during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a classroom where students sleep, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to remove the effects of caffeine and light and on how athletic performance has an effect on sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine sleep time.
In another section, participants are told how long-term insomnia may increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive links, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change students' behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know - as much as you have a right to know the effects on health when choosing to smoke cigarettes," added the Prof Czeisler.
The proud culture that "success to stay up all night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that insomnia was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you sleep sufficiently, and of good quality, it should be the student's 's secret weapon' to fight stress, severe fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a mode of hunger, which makes them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to draw up the course, after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to insist for a course around the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students who have graduated to make a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
The Prof Czeisler recommended that students consider making alarms for when they go to sleep, as well as for when they get up, and know about the harmful effects of "blue light" emanating from electronic screens and LED light, which can balance your circadian rhythm, and lead to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Ringers: Menard's Goal
Ringers suffered another period of distress when they played outside their home country as the Dolly Menga strike delivered Steven Gerard's separated side for a loss of 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox side was seeking to record their first win while they were travelling from the February 4-1 win in St. Johnstone, but Gary Hold's team only caused the second loss of Gerard in 18 parties as manager to leave his side eight points away from the great leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Mingoa scored seven minutes before the half-time and the list of non-spirational Rangers players never seemed to be reached.
While Ringers now go to the sixth place, Livingston ascends to the third and only after Hibernian on a difference of gol.
And there may be more trouble for Rangers after the onlinesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently hanging an object on the side of the team supporters who played abroad.
Gerard made eight changes on the side past by Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and was pleased with the way his well-trained form has hindered their opponents continuously.
Ringers could have dominated their possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They had to sing only two minutes from the beginning when the first play-off of Mengna sent Scott Pittman to go to the god of the McGregor but the midfider took his great chance.
Free-kick strong of Keaghan Jacobs then found the Craig Halkit skitter but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only sneeze from behind.
Ringers got control but there seemed to be more hope than belief about their game in the cold final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have had a penalty on the 15-minute mark as he and Steven Lawless struggled but the Stephen Thomson referee ignored the Cuban appeals.
Runners managed to target only two nice scavengers in the first half of the party but the previous Galkeeper of Ibrox Lyam Kelly barely worried about the head of Lassana Coulibaly and the light show of Ovie Ejaria.
While the first walk of Levi in the 34 minutes might have been when the other team was playing better, no one can deny that he had only punished them for their effort.
Once again, Rangers were unable to manage the good set-face of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose to choose Menga to end the action.
Gerard responded in the brake by changing to Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change almost provided an immediate impact as the winger swatted in Morelos but Kelley's impressive driver from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkit that caught a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's side could extend their position in the final stages but McGregor kept tight to deny Jacobs before Lithgow went in the open by the corner.
The alternate of Langers Glenn Middleton had another late request for penalty as he argued with Jacobs but again Thomson looked on the other side.
Almanak: Giinger's Inventor
And now page from our Almanac of "New Morning": 30 September 1882, such as today 136 years old, and DADDING WE SHOULD... the day on which the future physics Johans Wilhelm "Hans" Giiger was born in Germany.
Gigger has developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, an invention which eventually led to the device known as the Giger Constituent.
As a science institution since then, the Coordinator of Geger has also become the foundation of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bels of Coronado," in which those improbable coweys scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans appear:
A man says, "What kind of madoff is she?"
Rogers: "This Gigger Founder, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these boxes, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that give radioactivity to the minerals."
Evans said, "You say, sure it's popular now!"
"Hans" Giger died in 1945, a few days before he ended 63 years old.
But the invention with its name remains alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are transformed into a laboratory
They can then "see" a protein common to many cancers and then be injected again.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells by a patient, which are transformed into a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many cancers called HER2, then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethhesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "incentives growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectile cancers, explained the Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to immune cell uptake by patients and how to "learn" how to target cancer cells worked to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West made an attack on Verbali Favur Trump, while wearing a meth of MAGA, after his talk on SNL.
This Is Not Good
Kanye West was constructed at the studio during Saturday Night Live after a confusing performance in which he praised the President of the United States Donald Trump and said he was going to leave for the election in 2020.
After singing his third night song, named Ghost Town, in which he was dressed as a lady of Make America Great, he started to say against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"A lot of times I talk to a white person and say to me, "How can Trump please, what racist?"
If I had been concerned about racism, I had left America," he said.
SNL started the programme with a slide of the comedy in which Matt Damon appeared in which he broadcast the statement of Brett Kavanaugh before the Judicial Committee of the Senate on claims of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been broadcast, West's video is on social media by journalist Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to sneeze you with West when he took his place.
In addition, West had complained to the audience who had caught him behind the canal about his freedom.
"Bumble me behind the scenes.
He said, "Don't go out there with that freedom."
Bumble me!
Then they say that he's lost," said he, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You have to see the lost? And he continued saying that he would put on the cap of my superior, because this means that you can't tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments triggered a build-up at least twice the audience and the members of the SNL’s pastor appeared embarrassed, reported Varety, with one person there who said to the publication: "In the entire study a great silence fell."
West brought him as a late substitute for the channel Ariana Grande, who the boy friend she had, the Mac Miller rapper had died a few days ago.
West has buried many with the performance of the song I Love it, dressed as aperiard bottle.
West had support from the chair of the TUMUSA conservative group, Candace Turner who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most courageous spirits: GRAZZING TO THE FALL."
But the presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply "what he and this is something beautiful Amens."
"But I have not chosen to reward someone (by buying music or his clothes or supporting his "art") that I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It is free.
So many more we," she added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that it was now "what was previously known as Kanye West."
It is not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Didy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Didy.
The previous rapper, Snoop Dogg had the name Snowop Lion and of course the great music who no longer accompanied us Prince, changed his name to a symbol then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Use of attempted killing at knife moments in a restaurant in Belfatt
A 45-year-old man was accused of murder after a man was given knife wounds in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Blyshakamore, said the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Court of Justice of Belfast Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
The Game of Throns Kit Harington style speaks of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role in spreading the sword as John Snow in the series of violent megavat of HBO Game of Throns.
But the 31-year-old actor spoke of the heroist macho, saying that such roles on the screen mean that the male often feels that they want to be violent to respect.
Speaking with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believed that "something went wrong" and had doubts about how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his cochle of a 31-year-old Game of Throns Rose Lesley, admitted that it has "strong interests" to address the issue.
"Peedly, I feel that I have a strong interest, currently--where did we go wrong with masculinity?," he said.
"What were we teaching men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we have now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through its many male characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes the parent feel that he or she wants to be this particular man?
I think this is one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because it is very clear that something went wrong for the juvenile."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make descriptions or slots of Game of Throns when the series came at the end of the coming summer, saying that "so war and horses".
Since November Kit will appear in the new production of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the history of a film producer and his brother, who he has left.
Recently the player revealed that when he met his wife Rose it was the best thing that came out of Game of Thranes.
"I met my wife on this program, so this way gave me my future family, and my life from here on," he said.
Rose interpreted the part of Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, John Snow, in the victory of Emmy's fantasy.
The couple married in June 2018 in the land of the family of Lesley in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14 % increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, say health officials.
Only around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people taking HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunan province.
However, one year later, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Gender transmission of HIV is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was criminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be common.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many transmissions of diseases stem from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects that a member of the staff disclosed GOP year data, says "dangerous lies" and "confused theories"
The representative of the United States Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff replaced the personal information of three United States Republican year-olds on the web pages of Wiipda of legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles has ascertained that the claims were spreading from punctuaries and websites of the "right-hand ultra".
"Dear, lie and more lies of whom they fill," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information allegedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers of the United States Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, replaced by an unknown person on Captol Hill during a hearing of the Senate panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against the nomination of Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure took place some time after the three years questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Getway Pondit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was associated with the Water Office and released the information of a member of Waterers' staff, reported the Hill.
"This unfounded allegation is completely false and absolute lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticism online, including by the former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This rejection is one of anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that it does not have time to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he shall not be angry.
It shall not be resistant.
The reasons of the defendant shall not be questioned.
It shall be calm and quiet."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanogh's Democrats, who was accused of the criticism that appeared too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will come out to take the Waters' seat in the mid-term elections, also heard a voice on Twitter.
"This is something great if it's true," he said on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned "the appropriate law enforcement authorities and bodies about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that authors will be revealed," continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions which are harmful and dangerous to each and to all of my staff."
Criticals of Johnny English Strickes Agin - Rowan Atkinson, poor symmetry
It is now customary to seek the meanings of Brexit in any new British perspective film and this seems to be applicable to the return of the franchise of imitation action by Johnny English - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was relived in 2011 with Johnny English Reboror.
Would the ironic autosatera on the subject of how bad we are obviously be the opportunity for a new country's export?
At any rate, Johnny English competitors with large eyes and parts of his face moving not as usual had the licence renewed for the second time to do everything wrong - that name most of all shows that it is a widespread comc creation designed for territories of people who do not speak English.
Of course it is the stupid secret agent who despite his strange claims to his sweet pastime, has some of Closseau's, a meeting of Mr. Bean and a large part of that man who contributed one note to the play of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in London.
He is also originally based on the traveller and the international man of a mystery who once Atkinson had made his part of the advertisements of Barclaycard TV, today forgotten, having left nightmares behind him.
There is one or two beautiful moments in this latest JE issue.
Pleased me the moment when Johnny English was moving to the elicator while he was wearing cobra dresses and the blade blades caught up with his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy appears, but the amorism feels rather poor and ugly, especially since the "serial" brands such as 007 and Mission Iân themselves offer the comedy as a confident ingredient.
Amorism is felt to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me the strange horrors of Johnny English were not as spontaneous and as focused as the sound of Atkinson in the Bean people's world.
The perennial topical opposition is now that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker filtered the very secret web network of British spaces, revealing the identities of all the British agents in the field, to the disappointment of the work agent - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the cherry on cake for the prime minister who is a sad and difficult figure, who is already suffering from a whole collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this character as Teresa May but is not very much in the script to work.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active cycle has been compromised, will have to bring someone to retirement.
And this means the inefficient Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in elegant buildings, but gives non-official lessons about how to become inflated: a little funny here as English offers a scholl of Rock.
English is taken back to Whitehall for emergency meetings and joins his previous very patient partner, Bough, interpreted again by Ben Miller.
Although now he is a married man, with a submarinal commander, a role of one interpreted by Vicki Peperdine, in which she is a little wet.
The two inseparables that always disturb everything in the Secret Service of her Majesty, lie behind the action, when they meet the character of a beautiful and handsome woman Ophelia Buletova interpreted by Olga Curylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister falls under the control of the billionth of the sweet technology which he claims can solve the problems of the British computer: the Jason Volta pillar, interpreted by Jackie Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey of fun-fed behavior: dress as weitters, give fire to a French high restaurant, create chaos to climb on the luxury yacht of Volta; and English begins a full anarchy as he tries to use virtual integrity offices to familiarize himself with the household intervention of Volta.
Certainly all stops lead to that latest sequence, but as amicable and anonymous as it is, has a little idea of child television.
Something quite moderate.
And like the other films of Johnny English I couldn't think: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really deserves his talent?
Labour refuses to prepare a school plan to work one week of four days but to be paid for five days
The Geremy Corbyn Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that will see the Brittans work a week of four days - but will be paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the company’s teacher to pass the residue from the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to the workers by giving them another day’s savings.
This would see employees benefit from a three-day weekend – but they still take the same wage with them.
Sources said that the idea would be "screw" with the agenda and economic plans of the party that the country moves in favour of workers.
The shift to a week of four days has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way workers take advantage of the changing economy.
Senior Officer of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"This will not happen tomorrow but a four-day work week is an inspiration that matches the party's approach to rebalance the pro-worker's economy as well as the party's global industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first to approve such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, inspiration is currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
A speaker for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not party policy and the party is not considering it."
The Archbishop of Opposition John McDonnel used the Labour conference last week to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to take back power from "anonymous directors" and "those who profit" in utility firms.
The opposition cannibalist plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take back their entire share as the Labour government can make a "deduction" based on perceived misconduct.
It also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create Inclusive Host Funds to provide 10 per cent of the equity of private sector firms to employees, who are willing to take annual dividends up to €500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy says "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation of Kavanogh can change their understanding
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Bret Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by one week, and raises the question as to whether the findings of the Bureau may influence any Republican publisher to withdraw his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Senators of the Republic John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleagues from South Carolina.
"Sweet, and sure," said Kennedy.
"I said I and I entered the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after he issued that allegation, I said, "Why?"
He was resolved, determined, inquisitive."
However, the vote of Graham seems difficult to change.
"I've already decided about Britt Kavanaugh and must be a very big accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bret rejected it strongly," added Graham, referring to Christine Blassey Ford.
"And any person it mentions cannot verify it.
It is 36 years old.
I haven't seen anything new change."
What is Global Ciitzen Festival and Do What to Reduce Poverty?
The following Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a very impressive list of stars that will appear and an equally impressive mission; which will end the world's poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people coming to Central Park's Great Law to not only enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sie Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the true purpose of the event that will end extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of Global Power Project, a representation group with the hope of ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless I was ready to pay a VIP ticket), those who were going to the concert had to end a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, send an e-mail to a world leader, make a call or other significant ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with the remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
The idea that people are rewarded with free concert is a genuine way to persuade people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clictism" - people feel that they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tablet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says that it registered more than 19 million "action" from its supporters, which I insist on a number of different objectives.
This says that these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announced its actions, at least $10 billion of which were already shared or collected.
The group estimates that the safe funds have so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the diaper.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and committed implementers that "help children grow to their full potential," with the promise that Rwanda will provide $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after they have received over 4,700 gifts from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of nutrition a footnote in history," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Trading Allman to the crowd during a direct concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to invite the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequent questions on his website asking "what makes you think we can destroy extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "There will be a long, hard journey - sometimes we will meet and fail.
But, like the large movements of civil rights and anti-apartheid, we will succeed, because we have more power when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, So far Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the artists who will appear at this year's event in New York, which will present him Debera-Le Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US uses the Naval Fleet to "block" to hinder Russian energy exports - Internal Secretariat
"If necessary", Washington could resort to its Naval Fleet to prevent Russian energy from affecting markets, including the Middle East, revealed US Secretary Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's growth in Syria - especially, where it operates with a legitimate government invitation - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they find in the Middle East is that they have to negotiate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, on the southern side of Europe," he allegedly said.
And, according to the officer, there are ways and means to address this.
"The US has the ability, with our Naval Fleet, to ensure that sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy is not on the market," said he.
Zinke was addressing those who attended the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group who considered himself the "energy consumer voice" in the US.
He continued to compare Washington's approaches in addressing Russia and Iran, noting that these are the same.
"The economic choice on Iran and Russia is, to a lesser extent, the leverage and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as "one-powered person" with an economy that relies on carbon fuels.
The statements come from the fact that Trump's administration was on a mission to strengthen the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's management officials, including the President of the United States Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to exit from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the "territory" of Moscow.
Moscow has often claimed that the gas of $111 billion, which is expected to double the existing gas capacity to 110 billion kubic metres, is purely an economic project.
According to the Court of Justice, the Commission considers that the measure is compatible with the internal market and that it is incompatible with the internal market.
"I believe that we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and consumers must be able to choose suppliers," said the Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), invited the United States to stay away from Europe's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Cancleler Angela Merkel and President Russian Vladimir Putin.
Elisabeth Warren Ser "Swrite Us" If you do not go out for a president in 2020, tell the Senator of Massachusetts
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren, Saturday said that he would "test closely" whether to go to a president after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting of the council in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that it considered it to be an issue.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government and this includes a woman in the highest position," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, we will carefully examine whether I will go to a president."
Warren commented about President Donald Trump at the council meeting, saying that he was "take this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was direct in her criticism of Trump and his nomination to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren said on Friday, "we naturally need a FBI investigation before voting."
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that a majority of Waren's own constituents do not think that it should come out for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters of Massachusetts said that the year-old should not go out for election, according to the survey of the University Political Research Centre of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the election issue.
The survey showed more support for the election issuance by the previous Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential election exit and 48 percent against him.
Other high profile democratic names discussed in relation to a potential issue for the 2020 election include former Vice-President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said to officially decide by January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin refers to the TTSD of Track Palin in the demonstration of Donald Trump
Trick Pallin, 26 years old, spent one year in Iraq after being registered in September
He was arrested and brought on an incident of domestic violence at Monday night
"This is my son, what he's going through after he's returned, I can deal with other families who experience the MSD exercises and some of the injuries that our soldiers return to," told the audience in an exhibition for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahama.
Palin called his arrest as "the obvious problem that no one is addressing" and said about her son and other prisoners of war, "they return a little different, return stronger, tell them if there is that respect for other soldiers like them and air personnel, and every other member of the military, gave the country."
He was arrested in Wales, Alaska, and brought on an attack of domestic violence against a woman, while he intervened with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was a young man, according to Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the Police Department of Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. supports a challenge for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District are supporting a legal challenge to a new US policy that rejects asylum to victims who flee from gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and districts, Friday presented a case of a court friend in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the player in Grace's case against Sexs submitted by the US Civil Freedoms Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and the boys members of his violent gang," they abused her but the US officials rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
It was kept in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, producing a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, as nations are facing pervading problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The United States' new asylum policy failed a 2014 decision by the Migrant Appeal Board which allowed undocumented immigrants to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
On Friday, in a statement, the Attorney General of the Corombia Carl Racine District said that the new policy "has ignored decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum claims to be awarded on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a motive violates this principle, has said the case of a friend of the court.
Lawyers continued to argue that the policy to deny immigrants income harms the US economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
Advocate General Justice Sex ordered immigration judges to cease providing asylum to victims who fled domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a given social group or political opinion," said the political announcement on 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Stainless rescue forces in Palu as the number of deaths doubles in the fight against time to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become increasingly terrible.
"You feel very intense," said a 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while she was embracing her baby with fever at an escape centre in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
The residents seemed to return to their destroyed homes, looking for their watered things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 size, were too full.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Harris, which suffered fractures in sight and shoulder, remained outside the Palus Army Hospital, where patients are treated outside due to continuous healthy shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he reported that he felt the violent earthquake moving the hotel floor in the fifth floor he was using with his wife and daughter.
"There was no chance of saving ourselves.
I crushed with the remains of the wall, I think, " Harris told the Associated Press, and added that his family was in the place for a wedding.
"I listened to my wife crying for help, then silenced.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bulling" with "propagand advertisements"
One week after a Chinese official newspaper released a lecture on four pages in a daily U.S. newspaper trying to sell the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The President of the United States Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to China Daily's paid supplement to the Die Moines Register - the newspaper sold mainly in Iowa State - after accusing China that it was seeking to enter the US Congress elections on 6 November, accused China of rejecting it.
The accusation of Trump that Beijing was trying to enter the US elections marked what the US officials said to Ruters that it was a new phase in a campaign being launched by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to make advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a fast-tracking trade war which sees them passing tariff rounds on imports of each of them.
In addition, the Commission found that the Chinese exporting producers did not provide any information on the injury suffered by the Union industry during the investigation period.
Terry Brandt, former U.S. Ambassador for China and long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods for China, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Brandt on an opinion page in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, "now doubles this buliming by making propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"In spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's beloved tradition of free expression and free press by putting into disputation paid in the De Moines Register," wrote Brandt.
"In contrast, on the newspaper stand down on the road here in Beijing, you will find limited dissemination voices and you will not see a true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China's problematic economic transition, as media are under restriction of the Chinese Commonist Party," wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoids the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Celebrate Women Prior to the Mid-term Elections with the Kavanogh Debate, Warn the Anatists
As many Republicans of the top are supporting and defending the nomination of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh while facing various allegations of sexual assault, the analysts warned that they will see an adverse reaction, particularly during the next mid-term elections.
Feelings about this were very high, and most Republicans are already showing officially that they wanted to be led by the vote.
These things can't be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said to doubt that the last minute push of Senator John Fake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation will be sufficient to speak to angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday-- they won't forget it tomorrow nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators sang "Non next November!" as they protested in the Senate hall as the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to lead with the designation of Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasley Ford's statement, reported Mik.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high, said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst to the news site.
"People are saying that they were already high; and true.
"But they may be higher, particularly between female voters who change the vote in the subpoenas and smaller voters, aged 18 to 29, who, while not interested in the president, often do not vote."
In addition, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation has taken the view that it is in the interest of the Republic of Korea to take part in the investigation of the alleged sexual assault against the Supreme Court.
"This has become a full blend for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"This does not concern only the vote of the committee or the final vote on whether Kavanaugh is placed on the bank, it also concerns the way the Republicans manage this situation and deal with it," indicated to the news station Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group helping to elect the Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somehow divided over to those who believe in the light of Ford and Kavanogh’s statements, with little more support for the latter.
New surveys by YouGov show that 41 per cent of respondents definitively or probably believed the Ford statement, while 35 per cent claimed that they definitively or probably believed the Ford declaration.
In addition, 38 percent claimed that they thought that Kavanogh probably or definitely lied during its declaration, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations filed by Ford as well as at least another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed to the Judicial Committee of the Senate under oath last week that Kavanogh while he was a young woman attacked at the age of 17.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court’s nomination exposed his genitals to her while they were at a feast while they were studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Inventor plans to start a New Internet to compete against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the Inventor of the World Wide Web, will launch a new business seeking to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
In addition, the Commission considers that the aid is compatible with the internal market and that the aid is compatible with the internal market and is incompatible with the internal market.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people are allowed access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee recognized that the intention behind Inrupt is "domination of the world."
"We have to do it now," said about the new business.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their "personal online data store" or PDO.
This may contain contact lists, lists of what should be done, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spesty are all available on one and all at the same time.
What makes the shop a single online personal data is that it is fully in the hands of the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal self-authorisation through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is that the company would bring resources, process skills and appropriate skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform brought up by IBM, some staff developers who have a contract to work on the project, and a volunteer platform community.
By starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all their business models are turned down below today to tomorrow.
"We do not ask their permission."
On a website published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "The mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid."
In 1994, Bernards-Lee transformed the Internet when he set up a World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachosets.
In recent months, Bernards-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I find an immenist for this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest of Victoria Cross of World War I
The only cleric of the Church of England who won Victoria Cross during World War I as a rival was celebrated in his village 100 years later.
Lt Cur The Reverend Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack in Belenglise and Lehaukort.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the highest British military honour.
On Saturday a commemorative stone was revealed by his two grandsons in a ratat in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that he was "symbolically symbolic" that the stone had to be revealed exactly 100 years after the victory of the Annuh prize.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt Kur led his battle on the other side of the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in many fogs and fires from on-site rifles and machene gangs."
Later he rushed to the fire line and with the "big courage" led the line forward before he went to a broom on the spot alone and lost three senses from the troop.
Lt Cur was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just one month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that the actions of annoyance were "something I know I can never reach there but something very humiliating."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also put a girl behind the bed, which was led by the Empire Youth Band of Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that he was "are feeling very honored that he played a role in this party" and added "the courage of a genuine hero was demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA supporters remained up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead of finished with Pope Pig
Imagine this, you have kept awake all night to see Bellator 206 packed to end the denial of seeing the main event.
The list by San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and were shown directly during the night in the UK on Channel 5.
On 6am, as George Mousasi and Roy MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK remained confused when the broadcast changed to Pope Pig.
Some were not impressed after they remained up until early hours especially for the fight.
One party on Twitter described the change to the child's carton as "some kind of fun tea."
"It is a government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was not appropriate so they had to switch to the children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of Bellator's marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Pep the pig," yes."
The president of the company Belator Scott Coker said that they will work on their schedule to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think that when I think about repetition, we probably can fix something," said Coker.
"But now there are the sixth morning of Sunday and we will not be able to arrange until Sunday of our time, the Monday of their time.
But we are working on it.
From me, when the broadcast was turned on, there were many ongoing messages and not all of them were sweet.
We were trying to fix the solution, thinking it was a technical mistake.
However, it was not a governmental issue.
I can promise you that the next time it's not going to happen.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and tried to deliver it more to the supporters and instead of being overly bitter.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" due to sex
Tom Daley's Olympic count says that he grew up to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said that he had not realized until he went to the secondary that "not everyone like me."
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Laurent Laverne, he said that he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give “hope” to others.
He also said that when he became a parent he was less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular programme editor, Kirsty Young, took a few months to bed because of illness.
While seen as being abandoned on the first Laverne program, Daley said that he felt "less than anyone else" growing because "it was not socially acceptable to please you boys and girls."
He said: "To date, those emotions that you feel less than, and feel different, were the true things that gave me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that it was "something", he said, not to discourage everyone when they eventually got to know about his sexuality.
The Bronze Olympic medal for twice became a high profile promoter for LGBT and used its appearance in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to criminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt fortunate that he could live freely without blame and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The world winner for three times said that when he came to love a man - a film producer from the United States Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "was surprised" for him.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, last year but said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When he passed such things at such a young age - he went to his first Olympics of 14 years old and his father died with cancer three years later - said that it was hard to find someone of the same age who had had similar beautiful and ugly experiences.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, for me the important thing was that I wanted to win a gold medal," he said.
"Know what, there are things greater than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is rubie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die and one of the things he had asked was if they already had the tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You won't be here to be in the front row,' said he.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized that it was not inindicable," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the Olympics of 2012 and won the Bronze.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed all my life--that I was standing in front of a crowd from countries in Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspires the first choice of his song - Heather Small - which was compatible with him in the way to the Olympics and is still hanging the bar.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mikelson which no longer in shape remains on the bank at the Ryder Cup Saturday
The American Phyl Mikkelson will make a record Saturday when playing his 47th game of the Ryder Cup, but will have to change his shape to avoid being an important stage not so happy.
Mickelson, who plays at the binary event for a record of 12 times, remained on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the football and the Saturday feursomes.
Instead of being the centre of action, as it was often for the United States, the great winner of five times in his day between being a supporter and working on his game from the distance with the hope of restoring his concern.
One who would never give the ball right even in the fullst of his career, the 48-year-old man is not ideal for the difficult course of Le Golf National, where the long distance loosed once after the other causes misappropriation.
And if the course alone is not of heart-throwing enough, Mikkelson, in the ninth game Sunday, faces the exact signs of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who joined the new Fleetwood, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, with four points below the start of the 12 single game, start well, the Mixelson game can prove to be a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say something else.
"He fully understood the role he played today, taping on tears and putting his hand around me and saying that he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"I have a lot of confidence in himself.
It is Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably did not play two games.
I saw more, but this is the way I worked and this is the way we thought it would go.
He must be out there, like everyone else."
Mikelson will exceed the record of Nick Faldo for the most part of the Ryder Cup that was played on Sunday.
This can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career which has never reached the full range of its differential record.
Mikelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halfs, though Furyk said that his presence brought some intangible things to the team.
"It's tight, sarcasstic, funny, likes to talk to people, and a very good man to have in the team room," explained.
"I think younger players took pleasure in critical him, this week, that was something fun to see.
It provides much more than just games."
European Chief Thomas Bjorn that the high position on the front can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European master, is aware of the experience that a position on the front drawn before the last day's Kings in the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into a uncomfortable journey.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, where one side led by Seve Ballesteros maintained an advantage of five points on Americans but ended up with a real narrow margin, with a victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"Keep reminding yourself that we had a high-end position in Valderrama; we had a high-end position in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with little," said Bjorn, in the press, after seeing the 2018 Class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday to be on the front by 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in this team that it is not over yet.
Tomorrow you go with yourself and your body.
Get out there and do all the good things.
It has not finished all until you have brought the points on the team.
We have an objective, and what we try to welcome this trophies, and the focus will remain there.
I have always said, I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we know very well what there is on the other side - the biggest players in the world."
Betrayed how his players played on a difficult golf track, Bjorn added: "Never go to an oltrè step from me in this.
A different challenge tomorrow.
It still concerns the individual performances we see, and this is something different to do.
It's very nice to be out with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out individually, then it's tested for your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you want to pass on to the players, who will issue your best tomorrow.
Now, let your warp partner and he wants to leave and leave his best, too."
In contrast to Bjorn, the opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to play better individually than when they did as partners, with the exceptions they Jordan Spieteh and Kevin Thomas, who have acquired three points from four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those last days that could change everything, after he was part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up telling as soon as Europe made the "Medinah Village."
"I remember to the least of it," said in reply when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the master in 1999, prepared his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important parties, but you want to come to that beginning as soon as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When that momentum comes one side, put a lot of pressure on those mid-parts.
We set up our list as appropriate and put those men in the way we felt, you know, trying to do some miracles tomorrow."
Thomas had been given the task of trying to lead the fight back and facing Roy McIllroy in the best game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, play Fleetwood and Ian Pulter the other Europeans in the best half of the order.
"I went with this group of men in this way because I think it covers all the way," said Bjorn on his singles choices.
Germany's new war postponed again
The newest company of the German Naval Fleet had to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the ageing Bierda timers, but there will not be at least by next year due to systems with increasing defects and cost, reported local media.
The commissioning of "Rheinland-False," the main ship of the famous new tradesmen of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a speaker for the military.
The vessel had to join the Naval Fleet in 2014, but the problem-problems of the post-consignment cast the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class that ordered the Naval Fleet back in 2007 will be replaced by the remaining Bremen class sprayers.
It is understood that they will have a strong voice, an exhibition of missiles against aircraft and against ships as well as some catalytic technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic synergists.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods – this should be possible to operate the most new craft up to two years away from home ports.
However, a continuing delay means that the vessels of the latest technology – which allow Germany to project power outside the coast – will already be old until the time they enter the service, notes Die Zeit.
The F1225 spray of bad luck appeared in the news last year, when the German Naval Fleet officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to Blohm & Vos Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Naval Fleet returned a ship to shipbuilder after delivery.
It was little known about the reasons for this, but German media quoted a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that made the ship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important as the ship of the Baden-Württemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 seamen - only half of the workers on the older Bremen class sprayers.
In addition, it appears that the ship is heavily overburdened of reducing its performance and limiting the ability of the Naval Fleet to increase future updates.
The "Rheinland-False" of 7,000 tonnes is understood to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the entire project price - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
This is said to have reached a shock of €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) – from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems of the most new trade unions become especially important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is decreasing.
Earlier in the year, Hans-Pieter Bartels, the head of the German parliament defence committee, acknowledged that the Naval Fleet currently "has a lack of vessels to withstand deployment."
The officer said that the problem had grown over time, as old ships were commissioned but replacement vessels were not provided.
He complained that none of the Bden-Württemberg class traders could join the Naval Fleet.
National Trust is mentioned on the secret life of bats
A new land-based research in Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape when seeking food.
It is hoped that the findings will show a new light on the behaviour of single mammals flying and helping to guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists in the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipers as well as brown bats with long eared and Daubenton in the Inverewe Garden in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
An expert analysis of all recording noises will ascertain the frequency of bat calls and what species is doing.
A habitat map will then be produced and a report that will create a detailed picture of their landscape scale of behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of pastures and how best to keep forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and across the United Kingdom has decreased considerably over the past century.
These are under threat from building and development work affecting habitats and habitat losses.
Wind turbines and light can also pose a risk, as can vegetarian paper to catch insects and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are currently blind.
However, because of their notary hunting traditions, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they come to catch the prey.
They use sophisticated eco-locality techniques to indicate insects and obstacles in their passage.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, house inspections and sometimes rescue.
The organisation even set up the first and only scotch reserve in the Threave Land in Dumfries and Galloway, which welcomes eight of the ten species of skolice nightflies.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is their ideal territory.
"It's in Threave we have a very good area for bats tonight," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veterinary trees and the very very well habitat.
But there is much more about the yet unknown bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about what they need to thrive."
It stresses the importance of checking bats for the maintenance of properties as it is possible that unintended destruction of a single motherland could kill up to 400 women and young people, possibly destroying a whole local population.
The bats are protected and are illegal to kill, crush or sad or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer for the Conservation Trust of the Nightfeats, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "Since we have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we still don't know how to go their populations."
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations as lawyers are ready to look for a German magazine
Cristina Ronaldo referred to rape claims against him as "false news", saying that people "wanted to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are expected to look at the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The player in Portugal and Juventus who plays in front was accused of supposing an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He alleged that he had paid $375,000 that he would not say anything about the incident, reported Der Spiegel Friday.
Speaking on a video on Instagram Live with his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, referred to the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the winner of Ballon d'Or for five times while watching the camera.
"We must promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They must become famous to say my name, but this is part of the work.
I'm a happy man and everything's going well," the player added, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to court to seek out Der Spiegel on the allegations, which they called "inoperable reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Dr Christian Schertz said that the player seeks compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in a room in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a discotka, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly arrested it from the anus, according to documents submitted at the District Court of Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his recovery after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" "good man" disappointed by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that both had sex, but that this was by consensus.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to a solution outside the court because she felt "warred by repression" and was worried that she would "be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says that she is now seeking to change the solution as soon as she is traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo had come to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he walked with Italian football opponents in an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "laughs forever" that has lost car manufacturers
The UK "laughs forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Business Secretary Gregor Clark.
He added that it was "an concern" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop its factory production in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the Brixit case of no agreements cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - making Auris and Avensis of Toyota - produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the British comes out of the EU at the end of March we will see a cut in production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the managing director of Toyota in Burnston.
Other UK manufacturers raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on how to function cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW states, for example, that it will close its Mini plant for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the case of Brexit of no agreements.
Today's production line of Toyota works on an "accurate time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars conducted according to order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be border barriers which the industry claims could lead to delays and shortcomings of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep an inventory of more than one day at her Derbyshire plant, said the company, and therefore production is discontinued.
Mr Clark says that the Theresa May Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "a calibrated precisely to avoid these border controls."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that allows, as I say, not only the success to enjoy at present but to seize this opportunity," said the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue what was a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say for the time being to stop production, but in a longer period, it warned that increased costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the defendant of the United Union in the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience when these jobs leave, never return.
A government speaker said: "We have moved an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein can again be delayed, says the White House
Donald Trump's risk meeting with the deputy general lawyer Rod Rosenstein can be "delayed by another week" as he continues the fight on the reputation of the supreme court Brett Kavanaugh, said the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein handles the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueler, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's aid and Russia and a potential obstruction of justice by the president.
If Trump is going to exclude the deputy general lawyer or not, thereby jeopardizing the independence of Mueler, Washington's taunter for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wire clothing to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by 25 amendments.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, although there were reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, which was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said that he "prefers not to" to expel Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid wrongdoing with the hearing of the judicial committee of the Senate in which Kavanogh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blassey Ford, both gave their testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, which delayed further full voting of the Senate.
Sunday, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "There has not been a date set for it, it may be this week, and it may take the following week because of all the other affairs going on with the supreme court.
But now we see and I always love keeping the picture up."
Some journalists contest this claim: Sanders has not been holding a press meeting at the White House since 10 September.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of the meetings was not due to a lack of grace with TV journalists "to try to attract and influence the audience", although she said: "Since we agree with the fact that they try to attract and influence the audience."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the picture be added.
"The president holds more Q & Answers sessions compared to any president that was previously present," she added without quoting any evidence: "We looked at those numbers."
The meetings will still be held, said Sanders, but "if the picture has the chance to ask questions to the president of the United States directly, this is far better than talking to me.
We've tried to do this a lot and have seen it often in the last few weeks and this will replace the press meeting where one can talk to the president of the United States."
Rarely Trump answers questions when leaving the White House or when participating in open sessions or press conferences when visiting nationalities.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he acted softly and sometimes strangely in front of groups of journalists.
The health secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit-related fears
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the gratitude and desire of the country that they remain behind the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter when less than six months remained for the United Kingdom to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to entering into the cost of defined status applications for EU citizens working in its evolving public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "As of summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on exit have continued, moving towards decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK Government was also increasing its preparations for a possible scenario of no agreement.
I know that this is certainly a time of uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I want to support now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely home and we want you to stay here."
Christy Abercrubie Makes Emergency Surgery After That Suffering In Rasu
The onlinebacker Crision Abercrombie of Tennessee State Tigres has performed emergency surgery after having suffered injury on Saturday when his team lost against the Vanderbilt Commodores by 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The main coach of the State of Tennessee Road Reed told journalists that the injury had occurred shortly before the end of the time.
"He went on the sideline and as he fell there," said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff gave oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before putting it on a ulcer and taking it back for further examination.
As a result of the investigation, the Commission found that there is no evidence that the company had been able to recover from the operation of the Aberrobee in the period from the date of its entry into force.
Harris added that "to date there is no detail as to the type/extension extent of the injury" and the State of Tennessee is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in the second year of suspended university, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after he left Elinois.
Saturday in total he had five taxis before he came out of the game, leading to a total of 18 taxis of his season.
Foreign buyers will be required to pay more stamp tax when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be required to pay more stamp tax when they buy property in the UK with surplus money used to help homeless people under new Tory's plans
This change will neutralise the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters
The increase in stamp tax will be imposed on non-taxables in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects it to rise to €120 million per year - to help homeless people
Today Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers should pay a higher rate of stamp tax when buying property in the UK - with extra money used to help people without home.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high pay earners.
The increase in stamp tax will be imposed on non-taxable individuals and firms in the UK, with surplus money boosting Government efforts to fight road sleep.
The additional payment - which is additional to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on the second house and rental purchase - could be three percent.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to €120 million per year.
As a result, the market share of the new construction properties in London is about 13 percent, which is being purchased by non-UK residents, increasing prices and making it more difficult for new buyers to make a first step in the housing purchase phases.
Many rich areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "fantams" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time abroad.
The new policy came out only a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the stamp tax in order to help more young people buy their first house.
He accused the large construction firms that were holding high property prices by cutting the land and not using it, and urged Ms May to abandon quotas on affordable housing in the UK to remedy the "acquisition situation" in the UK.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed eye-to-eye housing reforms, including rent checks and the end of "no fault" expulsions.
It also wants to give the councils great powers to build new houses.
Ms May said: "I said last year that I will devote my office to restoring the UK dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And this means adjusting the broken market of our accommodation.
The United Kingdom will always remain open to people who want to live, work and save their lives here.
However, it is unfair that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, find it easy to buy housing as high as the UK residents.
For many people the dream of having a home has become too remote, and the indignity of sleeping on the streets remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland"
The head of Sunderland Jack Ross says that his "fundamental ambition" is to once become the manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scottishs are welcoming the challenge of re-establishing the North-East club, which is currently in third place in the League One, with three points different from the one in the first place.
This summer he moved to a stadium of Light after guiding St Mirren back to the ISCOTISH Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to play for countries as a player.
I got a B cap and nothing more," Ross said to the Scotland BBC Sports Sound.
"But when I was still a child, I often went with my father to see Scotland playing in Hampden, and it always remained the thing that drew me back.
However, this opportunity will only come if we succeed in managing a club."
Those who came before Ross as a manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Elurdice, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says that he was not worried about the fact that he would follow such established names in such a large club, while previously rejected the offer from the City of Bernsley and Ipswich.
"At the moment, my success will be based on "I might again deliver this club to the Premier League?"
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that this club belongs to Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get it there, but I probably think I've succeeded here only if I succeed in taking the club back there."
Ross has only been in his career as manager for three years, after a period of head assistant in Dumbarton and having spent 15 months with Hearts' copying staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from the review for the third category, and transformed St Mirren from the edge of the relegisin into a winner of the title of the following season championship.
And Ross says that he is now feeling more comfortable than he felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
As for when he took Alloa in his hand, he recalled that "it was probably a big change."
"I generally thought that the position of manager was the most suitable for me, much more than that of a player.
This may sound strange as I went well, had a decent living, and enjoyed some reasonable achievements.
But games can be difficult.
There are many things you need to pass on every week.
Still, I still experience this in terms of stress and work pressure but I just feel that the position of manager is appropriate to me.
I always wanted to manage and now I am doing it, and I feel that throughout my adult life now I feel the most comfortable."

Survey finds that the best time to take a beer pin is at 5.30pm in the evening
The summer heat wave has boosted the return on UK chips in difficulty but put increased pressure on the restaurants of the same company.
In July, the groups of pops and bars saw an increase of 2.7 per cent in sales – but figures revealed that the return on restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a Business Consultant CGA, who collected figures, said: "Several months and longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a model similar to the previous month of June, when sales in chips increased 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were hit even more.
The decline of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trade in June continued to worsen in July.
The pubs and bars whose main sale is the drink were those which were most suitable in terms of the financial results compared to the previous period while the sales of restaurants decreased.
The chips whose main sales are food have also suffered heat, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out drinking.
In the chips and bars managed the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, while food dropped to three per cent."
Paul Newman, one of RSM analysts on entertainment and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social events or sports events remain the biggest factors in the market sales of take-aways.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent a year after a year will be particularly burdensome in addition to continuing cost pressures.
The hot and long summer could not come at a worse time for operators whose main sales are food and only time can advise us whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide much-needed rest."
The growth of total sales in pops and restaurants, including the opening of start-ups, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow pace in starting start-ups.
The monitoring of the sales of the Coffer Peach Trainer industry for the UK bus, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operational groups, with combined revenues of more than €9 billion, and is the established benchmark of the industry.
One in five children has secret social media accounts hidden from their parents
Surveys reveal that one in five children - some of them aged 11 - have secret social media accounts hidden from their parents and teachers
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the "Insta Falls" pages.
News has great fears that sexual content is being replaced
Twenty percent of students said they had a "first" account to show their parents
One in five children - some of them aged 11 years - is creating social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed rapid growth in the "Insta Falls" accounts - a reference to the site for the sharing of Instagram photographs.
News has great fears that sexual content is being replaced.
Twenty percent of students said that they operate a "first" account present to show their parents, while having private others.
A mother who met her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a young woman who was urging others to draw her out - "Suppress me."
Research, from Digital Awareness UK and from Headmasters' and Headmistes Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of young people aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, half of whom admitted to keeping private accounts.
The head of HMC Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that many young people are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will become the "voice for athletes" on the Scottish athletic board
Eilid Doyle was elected to the Scottish athletic board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most athlete of the race and not the most successful course and President Ian Beatie has described this change as a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from her vast experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the community of Scottish athletes, the UK and the world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by becoming part of the board," said Beatie.
Doyle said: "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help to conduct sports in Scotland."
The American, which won the 200 and 400 metres in the 1996 Games in Atlanta among its total of four Olympic Games' gold medals and which is now a regular critical of the BBC, is not able to move after having suffered from a small stroke attack.
On Twitter he wrote: "As today he gives me a stroke.
I couldn’t walk.
Physicians said that only time can advise us whether or not I recover or to what extent.
It was a beat job but I recovered completely, I learned how to reweep and today I am doing immoral exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
A breast pump advertising comparing mothers to cattle gives rise to different opinions online
A breast pump company gave rise to different online opinions with a advertising that compares breast-feeding mothers to captive cows.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered "the first breast pump in the world that can be worn and that does not make noise" the consumer's technology company Elvie issued a video inspired advertisement of ironic music to show the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers who use the breast pump.
Four real mothers lay in a mammoth filled with the straw of cattle with a disc which includes a liquefyic like: "Yes, I forgive myself but I don't have a tail" and "In case I don't like these, they aren't horses but horses."
The corus continues: "Pump out, pump out, I'm feeding my babies, pump out, pump out, I'm dreaming my women."
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, the video received different reactions from viewers, many of whom say it sheds light on the "terrures" of the milk industry.
Someone wrote "It was a very wrong decision that cows are used to advertise this product.
As we do, they need to be pregnant and give birth to milk, except that their babies are taken within a few days of giving birth".

Someone else commented: "One understands that this is a traumatic thing for both mother and baby.
But yes why don't we use them to teach a breast pump to mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "A really dark story cut out of reality."
Others defended the advertising, with a believing woman finding the disc "very fun."
"I think this is a global idea.
If only I had still bought one.
Pumping was making me feel the same as a cow.
The advertising is a little bit or too great but I've taken it.
This is a generic product," wrote someone.
Someone else commented: "This is a fun advertising aimed at mothers who smoke (often at their workplaces or toilets) and feel like a "cat".
This is not a advertising that commends or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video the group of women discovered that they were all blowing with non-eye pumps placed in their bras.
The concept after the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who smoke their songs say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pop, does not make any noise, has no wire or tube and sits in a breast-feeding needle without giving in the eye, thus giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even emerge while they are pumping.
Anna Balarin, a partner and ECD in a brother commented: "The Elvie Pomp is such a revolutionary product that a courageous and proactive launch is worth it.
By agreeing with the women who use the breast pump with the dairy cows we wanted to focus on the pumping of the breast and all the challenges it poses, while showing in a divergent and interrelated manner the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time that Elvie pump appeared on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the catalogue for the designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Free-Walk Migrant Children to Texas Border Camp
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply although the monthly border crossing has remained unchanged, partly because of the historical and severe policies introduced by the Trump administration making it more difficult for children to be placed with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and feared that if they made themselves available to care for a child they would endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their poultry would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would have been shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Almost 80 per cent of the individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's home are here illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminal.
We are therefore continuing to look for these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to make the process involving children faster, officials have introduced new rules which will require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, depending on the crew.
Many will appear through a video conference, instead of personally, to bring arguments in favour of their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those considered ineligible for aid will be imported immediately.
According to shadow workers and reports from the system in recent months, the more children are kept under custody, the more likely they become anxious or discouraged, which may lead to violent expression or attempt to escape.
Lawyers said that these concerns would increase in a larger facility such as Toronto, where signs that a child is finding him/her difficult, due to the size of the facility are more likely to be ignored.
They added that the movement of children to the town of the nest without giving enough time to prepare emotionally or without saying strength to their partners could lead to an trauma that many of them are already struggling.
Syria tells the "occurring forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
While addressing the UN General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moalem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as a deputy minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be properly addressed."
"They shall immediately and unconditionally withdraw," said the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terrorism almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011, with millions more moving from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to "fight this sacred battle until we are expelled from all the Syrian territories" both the terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, many of which train and advise both the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
With regard to the refugee issue, Moualem said that the conditions were good for them to return, and he mentioned "in some Western countries" for "destroyal fears" which led refugees to stay away.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are polarizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last strong Idelib major rebellion created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces supported by Russians on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target activists including the troops from the North Front linked to Al-Qaida, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and of the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for the elections.
Moualem established conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be restricted to "review of the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Mandate
With this logic, in 2020 Mr Trump will win the re-election provided that, as many free viewers hope, the end of his presidency in time.
Which will undoubtedly be "The most dramatic finale that has ever been in the presidency!"
So far, it appears that viewers have not yet seen it.
Since 2014, time ratings with the largest number of viewers have increased by more than double to 1.05 million on CNN and have almost contributed to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in time with the largest number of viewers, more than 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC's "The Rachael Madow Show" increased cable television ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers in the nights of major news.
"This is a situation that attracts people to it because it's not something we understand," said Neil Baer, presenter of the ABC drama program "Designed Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capital.
Nell Scovell, writer of veterinary comedy and author of "Just the Founny Parts: And a Future Hard Truths About Sneaking Into thewood Boys" Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Why you have caught me," she said to me, "Mrs. Scovell.
In this cocoa there is a value of entertainment.
Without a doubt, unlike anything else on TV, the headlines from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can reunite and the strength of the global economy.
To ignore what is happening around you is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And however, this goes beyond being an informed citizen when on the sixth you find yourself following a panel of experts discussing the use by Bob Woodward of a "deep background" source for his book "Fear," the Bomber's leather bottle with taste ("Grows that reflect pride", said Paul Washington Post) of Paul Manafort with a value of $15,000 and the implications of Mr. Trump's anomaly mask descriptions by Story Daniel.
I, for example, will never look back at Super Mario in the same way.
"A part of what it is doing as if this is real show is that every night it is bringing something to you," said Brent Montgomery, executive head of the Weeelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pown Stars", on the changing past and the development in the day-to-day lot of the Trump programme (fighting with the N.F.L., commend Kim Jong-un).
You cannot afford to lose one episode because otherwise you fall back.
When I contacted Mr. Fliss this week, outside the weather was the sun with an 80-degree temperature on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside to see MSNBC while recording the CNN.
He could not stand in front of television, not when there was a Brest Kavanaugh ready to face the Judicial Committee of the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
"I remember when before we did those exciting programmes and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilisation," said Mr. Fliss.
"I thought it was some joke, but in truth they were right."

Large amounts of money received from outside for the most stringent racing in the mid-term White House election
It is not surprising that the 17th Congressive district of Pennsylvania is seeing a large amount of money, thanks to the re-alignment of congregatory districts that have acquired two operators in a race for the same chair.
This has recently re-established the chapters of the sub-urban district of Pittsburg, the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is issuing as a candidate against another operator, the Republic of Kuwait Roths, which currently represents the twelve old districts of Pennsylvania, which extend much to the 17 new districts.
The maps were re-established after the Supreme Court of Pensylvania in January decided that the old districts had been imprisoned in an interconstitutional way in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the 17th new district promoted a difficult competition between the financial campaign of the main party finance, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) (National Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a family name in Pensylvania after winning with little difference in the special election of March followed by a lot for the eighteenth Congregatory District of Pensylvania.
That chair belonged to the Republic for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political criticism has given the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States Criminalised El Salvador Talli Support to China, then decided not to do this
The diplomas noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little help from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a reception meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and held a hotel in Panama until some partners expelled the administrative team of the Trump Organisation.
The officials of the State Department decided to contact the heads of the United States diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama again on the "recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said the speakers of the Service Heather Nauer, in a statement at the beginning of this month.
However, the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which in 2017 received around $140 million in US aid, including narcotic controls, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been burdensome for the Central American country and its high unemployment and killing rates.
As internal meetings began to progress, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, the officials of the highest administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with a view to bringing an effective end to any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been strongly criticised to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the administration places on the meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three American sent returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new or tough new message or punishment from Washington.
White House speakers, Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomas, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were supported by a close administration foreign analyst who also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
History Study
The next unexpected negative event could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible disruption of justice by Mr Trump, for which there is now very substantial evidence in the public register.
It is reported that Mr Mueler is also turning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was agreed with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In the event that the Congress passes to another person, Mr Trump will find himself responsible in that body, as he prepares to return to the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
This involves many uncertainties, and I do not intend to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable — nor is it his equivalent in Europe.
There are options to be made by all on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the fight.
In 1938, the German officials were willing to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, who would if the West had kept it and supported the Czechoslovakian Czechs in Munich.
We did not succeed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of inflation, and the priceless path of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Today Americans face many of these points of reflection.
What will we do if Mr Trump dismissed Deputy Advocate General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in problems since this document reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be registered in secret and that he should be disqualified for office.
Mr Rosenstein said that the report of The Times is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if F.B.I.'s investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair - or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual conduct and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote for Congress that will keep Mr. Trump responsible?
If we do not pass these tests, there will be a movement of democracy.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz from the same Nazi regime that he once occupied the house of my ambassadors.
She managed to live, evacuated to America and, 60 years later, on the day of worship of God, he gave me to turn the candles on that swattle table.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Durrans of the Rangers is idealistic before the competitive game with Rapid Vienna
Ringers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against Austrians, following the equally impressive outcome they brought in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented the middlefielder Graham Doorrans from making his first appearance of the season an equal result of 2-2 with Villarreal but he believes that Rangers could use that result as a catalyst for big things.
"This was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old boy.
"We entered for the game with the faith that we could get something and went out with a point.
We could probably have won it towards the last but, in all, an equal result was probably a fair result.
Probably they were better in the first half of the game while we went better in the second half.
Thursday will again be a great European night.
We hope that we can get three points but this will be difficult because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, we are sure that we can continue to do our best and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, between all that happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but there is a sense of positiveness at present.
The team is good and boys are very happy; training is good.
I hope we can now make our efforts, forget the last season and succeed."
Women are concerned about this fear related to retirement savings
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be focused, a few people were talking to their family members about this.
About half of the subjects in the National Study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said to talk to their children about it.
"People want to be a member of the family to blame them, but they don't take steps to make a conversation," said Snyder, near the business president of the Nationalewide life insurance business.
You should start this way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes well in advance.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as those options can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial adviser: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid money-value life insurance policy to help cover these costs or self-insure with your own good - provided you have the money.
Take a decision after discussing your legal documents in the long term: Avoid legal battles.
Find healthcare provision to select a reliable individual to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
In addition, consider a provision for your finances.
Choose a person who trusts to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you are incapacity.
Do not forget small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan to be ready.
"Not only are the finances involved, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that the plan is completed."

Terremotes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, officials said, with the number of deaths expected to increase.
According to the Court of Justice of the European Union, the Commission considers that the aid is compatible with the internal market and that it is compatible with the internal market and that it is compatible with the internal market.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
These are some of the main facts about Palu and Donggala, about the island of Sulawesisis:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawesis, located at the end of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Sulawesis, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit the city, she was celebrating her 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regression extending over more than 300 km (180 miles) of the coast in the northwest of the island of Sulawesis.
Reference, administrative region under province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and farming are the pillars of the economy of the Central Province of Sulawesis, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Moroy, on the coast of the other side of Sulawesisis.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Migration Agency, Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, Tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dungala.
In 1996, Tsunami also hit the western side of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the Ring of Fire of the symbiotic Pacific and is often hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the West coast of Sumatra at the end of March and at the beginning of April.
He died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Terremot with a power of 6.8 hit South Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, striking a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
Date of UN designation: 29.8.1957
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a strength of 7.5 struck one of the islands of Mentwai, beyond Sumatra, which sunta sunami with a height of 10 metres destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Low earthquake struck the succession of Pedie Jaya in Aceh, which caused destruction and panic as people remembered in the devastating of the earthquake and fatal tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunami was cut, but more than 100 were killed because of a building that was damaged.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the top of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of temporarily isolated tourists.
Larger Sarah Palin Arrested on Domestic Violence Cases
He was arrested on charges of assault by the former Governor of Alaska and the vice-presidential candidate Sarah Pallin.
Palin, aged 29, from Isilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, which interfered with a report of domestic violence and restricted arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when female interlocutors tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone from her hand.
Palin is being held in the Capital Facility and is held on an unguaranteed bond of $500, reported the KTUU.
He appeared to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "certainly not guilty" when he was asked to give his motive, reported the network.
Palin is facing three Class A offences, i.e. he can be imprisoned for up to one year and has to pay a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of a Class B crime, which is punishable by a day of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been committed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with an attack on his father, Todd Pallin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, invited the police to report the alleged attack.

His girl alleged that she was hit by a tip in her face.
In 2016, Sarah Pallin was criticised by the veterinary groups after a comparison was made between her child's violent behaviour and the disorder from post-traumatic stress (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.

At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesis on Friday.
The earthquake with a power of 7.5 tsunamis and thousands of homes destroyed.
The electricity and communication networks are not working with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck only a few out of the centre of Sulawesis located in the north-east of Indonesia's capital city, Japhar.
Videos showing the moment of impact are circulated on the media.
Hundreds of people had been gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore with great power.
Federal prosecutors claim that the suspected terrorist attack of NYC is a rare death penalty
The federal prosecutors in New York are asking that Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of the terrorist attack of the city of New York, who killed eight people and was sentenced to death - a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, allegedly used a home Depot rental truck to conduct an attack on a road to the West Side Highway in Low Manhattan, by flying to the passengers and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "instinctly" killed the eight victims and "insuredly" caused serious physical injuries, in accordance with the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, presented in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, these two chiefs of the charge bear a possible death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed down to Saipov 22 accused of having been killed with the aid of organised displacement, typically used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
When they described the way that Saipov carried out this attack "soft, cruel and immoral", the prosecutors said that the attack required "substantial planning and meditation."
The notice of intent states that "Sayfullo Habbullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clives, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Herman Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnicco".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York, which has taught you a case of death penalty.
The abduction, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers but finally in September 2009 was sentenced to life in prison.
The last time that the death penalty was executed in a federal New York case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were murdered after having been found guilty of rape to carry out a exile to the Soviet Union during the Bierda War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed by the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of memory in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, told the police.
Date of UN designation: 29.12.2014.
He also requested that a flag of ISIS be placed in his hospital room, told the police.
He replied not guilty to the 22 chief of the charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who was representing Saipov, said that they were "certainly disappointed" with the decision to prosecute.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty motive for living in prison with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," said Patton.
The Saipov defence team had previously asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
MP Tory says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Negel Farage promised that he will "mobilize the army of the people".
The former head of Ukip said that politicians had to "feeling under pressure" by the Euroscients - as suggested by one of the Insa May MPs himself which he should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
The member of the Government of the Conservative Party Peter Bone said to the demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom so far would have "exited" if Mr Farage had been Secretary of the Brexit.
But the challenge facing Ms May to reconcile her highly divided positions has been highlighted by Torres who is not in favour of Brexit who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to maintain its Chequiers compromise plan on the right road among attacks by Brexitriera, those against Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted that despite the negative reaction she would continue to move forward to try to reach an agreement with Brussels - and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour party to choose between her package and the "cos".
Mr Bone said to the royal Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted "to abandon the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Mr Farage be given a high social position and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, so far we would have gone," he said.
The MP Wellingborough added: "I will judge the Brexit but we need to abandon the Chequers plan."
When he declared that he was against the EU, he said: "We do not fight world wars to be heroic.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bonn rejected suggestions that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their understanding and must remain not true."
Andrea Jenkins, Brexitera of Tory, was also present for the demonstration, telling journalists: "I want to say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Plan of Non-Popular Chequers with the general public, the Opposition will not vote for it, not popular with our party and our activists who in truth are those who go on the road and who have never voted for us.
Please forget the Chequers plan and start a name."
In a message targeted at Ms May, she said: "The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said to the rally that politicians should "feeling under pressure" that would have returned from the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us -- people -- and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to get back from the Brexit and we are here today to tell them that "we will not let you down if you do this."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he said: "I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is at the point that goes back from the Brexit.
We are mobilising in Brexit the army of the people of this country that has brought us success and will not spend until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud UK."
In the meantime, those against Brexit moved to Birmingham before making a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Following the launch of the group this weekend, a small number of activists broadcasters in writing by Tories Aginst Brexit (Touries Against Brexit).
Lord Adonis, who has a high social position in the Labour Party, has ridiculed the Conservatives for the security issues that have suffered by party caps as soon as the conference opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they may have the IT systems in place and all technology for Canada and, more importantly, for the unfrozen border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a whole farm.
The idea of good Brexit does not exist," he added.
Warren intends to "test carefully" the possibility to issue for the presidential election
The United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections he will "examine carefully the possibility of exiting for the presidential election".
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the member of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts spoke about its future in a debate with citizens at municipal level in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, which is a frequent criticism of President Donald Trump, will issue for re-election in November against the State Representative GOP Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachustus in 2016.
She was at the centre of speculation that could replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with constituents who have been using the format of a debate with citizens at municipal level since Trump took office.
A person who attended the meeting asked whether she intended to leave for the presidential election.
Warren replied that it was time "that the women go to Washington to repair our fragmented government, and this includes a woman at the top."

On Saturday, the police in Baton Rouge, La. announced that he was arrested in connection with the murder of the LSU's Boyde Sims basketball player who took place on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the 20-year-old Dayton Simpson arrest at 11 a.m. ET News Conference.
The Week they issued a shooting video, asking for help to identify the man who appeared in the video.
Sims, aged 20, was killed by flying near the campus of the Southern University in the morning.
According to 247ports, Saturday the chief of police Murphy J. Paul told the media "Wayde Sims suffered from a head injury and eventually died as a result."
Wade came in to defend his friend and hit him with a fly from Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to be on the scene, who had a weapon, and admitted to shoot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without problems and kept in custody in the Police Department of Eastern Parish Baton Rouge.

Grand Prix of Russia: Louis Hamilton approaching to get the world title after his team orders gave him the victory against Sebastian Veteel
Saturday, from the moment that Valteri Bots qualified before Louis Hamilton, it was clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
As a result of the in-house position in the first row, Botts had a good advantage and almost abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vetell to attack his friend.
Vettel was the first to enter the stop zones and allowed Hamilton to land with the others in the last place of the group, something that had to be decisive.
The Mercedes was stopped in the stop zone after another turn and exited immediately after Vectel, but Hamilton continued following a few bicycle action with a wheel which led to the Ferri driver having difficulty leaving the inside side free because of the risk of falling back after a double move to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the rear row of the grid and was in the seventh place until the end of the first round at the end of his years of age at the age of 21.
He was then in front for most of the race by not changing his tyres with a view to completing quickly and exceeding Kimi Raekkonen for the fourth place.
He eventually entered the stop zone in the 44th turn but could not increase his pace in the eight remaining turns while Raikkonen entered the fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valteri did his very good work all along the weekend and was a real genlum said let me by.
The team did truly exceptional work to get the first and second place," said Hamilton.
That was a physical act of evil
President Donald Trump made a joke to Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday in connection with her persistence that she did not disclose the letter from Christine Blassey Ford who was accusing the designated person of the Supreme Court of sexual assault.
When he spoke in Rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the witnesses given by Ford before the Senate of the Judicial Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "virile and dishonest and not sincere."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see the people who are angry and violent and rude and not sincere," he said.
"When you look at statements and disclosure of information and then say, 'No, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do You Recall?
Dianne Feinstein, did you miss some information?
Remember her answer... purchased the document - "e, e, what is it?
No, I don't see.
I didn't miss anything."
See, wait a minute.
We discovered... No, we didn't," added he, while imitating the Senator.
Feinstein you sent her the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanogh from Ford in July, and this was revealed earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the disclosure had come from her office.
"I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not betray her story," said Feinstein to the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep her confidential and I kept her confidential as she requested."
But it seems that her rejection was not well received by the president, who during the Saturday evening rally commented: "I know what I know, that it was a very bad physical act.
It may not have been discovered, but what is the worst physical actuation I've ever seen."
While continuing with his defence of the person nominated by the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three people, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their purposes.
"They have determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the gravity, the disgorges, they don't care about the injured, the cyclists to gain power and control," said the president according to reports from Media.

Air Traffic Control Dead to Ensure That People's Hundreds On Air Could Flee From the Terremot
An Air Traffic Supervisor in Indonesia is considered as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people can safely land.
More than 800 people died and many were lost after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesis on Friday, which was a tsunami.
Strong hits continued to dominate the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
However, although his colleagues fled to rescue, the 21-year-old boy Anthonius Guanaan Agung refused to leave his position at the control tower he was swooping at the Palu Airport, Mitira Sis Al Juffri Airport.
It remained calm to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then located on the runway, was able to leave safely.
He then exceeded the traffic control tower when he thought it was moving.
He died later in the hospital.
The speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohanes Sirait, said that the decision was likely to save hundreds of lives, reported ABC News of Australia.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we left this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"When we hear about this we feel a great relief," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Booutong is limited.
"It is estimated that the number is still increasing because many bodies were still under friction while many could not reach," said the speaker of the Sutoto Puro Nugroho agency.
The waves reaching up to six metres destroyed Palu in which mass dances will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aeroplanes are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance entered the sky.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Southern Cross of Indonesia are working hard to help those who are still alive but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military of the country: "I am asking you all to work night and day to complete any task related to evacuation.
Lesti?" reported the CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Incident of an aircraft in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is lost following the plane accident in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight that left the Pacific in Micronesia now says that a man is lost, having previously said that the 47 passengers and crew members had safely escaped the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement that from Saturday afternoon, she could not give details of where one man was passenger.
The airline said that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped to save passengers and other crew members after the aircraft hit the water when it tried to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
The officials said that seven of the people were hospitalised.
The airline said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the incident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The US airline and the US Naval Fleet both said that the aircraft in the lake was a few miles from the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the aircraft exceeded the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane entered very low.
"This is a really good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to pass through the water that was high up to the exit of the emergency on the plane that was sinking.
He said that the flight assistants were clicking and shouting, and that he suffered from a minor injury in his head.
The US Naval Fleet said that the seafarers who were working closely to improve moll also helped rescue by using a floating boat to carry passengers to the shore before the plane caved in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
In addition, the Commission notes that the airport services agreement was signed by Air Niugini on 30 June 2014.
Analist presents a holiday schedule in which a woman has been burned alive
Saturday the prosecution concluded its evidence on the case in the new process of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014 while she was alive.
The US Department of Justice analyst Paul Roblett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the cell records to gather information about 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis's movements and the victim, Jessica Chabers, 19-year-old, on the night she died.
Roulette said that he received localisation data from several mobile phones which showed that Tellis was with Chabers that night he died, contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Legger.
When the cell phone date showed that he was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and witnessed that he was not in the city at that time.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said that that night he was in Sanford's truck, Sanford said that he was "is lying, since my truck was in Nashville."
Another lack of consistency was that Tellis said that he had known Chabers for two weeks when he died.
Mobile records indicated that they knew each other only a week.
Roult said that shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted Chamber's messages, calls and contact information from his cell phone.
"He deleted her from his life," said Halle.
Defence is scheduled to start its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be delivered to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop aware?
Three hip-hop artists must challenge the negative perspective of the gender by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hiphop has gone beyond its origin of political messages and is addressing social issues.
They must go back to their roots and make the hip-hop popular consciousness again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen recent resurgents in the UK with artists such as Akala and Loukey.
Another black person?!
Naniy from NY trained a couple for removing her after a "racist" message
Naniy from New York is training you couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an erroneous message from the mother who was complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny that they are racist, and compare the case with "exortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed regret when she learned that the new person to care for children, Giselle Maurice, was a dark dragon when he arrived for the first working day in 2016.
"LEEEEEEEEE another SWEDEN PERSUNA," wrote Ms Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent Ms Maurice twice.
Having noticed her thick error, Palsco-Flaxman felt "cooled" and dismissed Ms. Maurice, saying that her former African-American nunny had not done her good job and that instead she was waiting for Philip, according to New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for her one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is training the couple for compensation with regard to dismissal, and is demanding compensation of $350 a day for the six-month live-in position for which she was initially employed, although without a contract.
I want to show them, listen, you can't do such things," she said to Post Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple attacked the racist statements, saying that the dismissal of Ms. Maurice was the most reasonable thing they could do, fearing that they could not trust her after they had defended her.
"I sent her something that she did not intend to say.
She is not racist.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco to Post.
"But if you trust your children in the hands of someone who spoke to you with goff, even if it was by mistake?
Is your baby born?
And come."
When comparing the case with an "extorsion", Plasco said that only two months had passed since his wife had had the baby and was "in a very difficult situation".
"You would accuse someone like this?
It's not a nice thing to do," added the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has quickly informed the couple about the social media, which has led them to their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington feared that the readers would not have anything to do with a talker.
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who is reading it for the first time before it is published.
"It's really fun to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman of the BBC before he was inspired to write the book of children by a small gamer, would surely have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of publication of the books was "beautiful but turned a little into a joke" after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was proud of his eventual success although he had never been able to talk about it.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he was not filled with himself," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like when you had a child to get something: be proud for them even if you weren't you who had achieved something.
I think he was looking at the success of Paddington in that way.
Although he was his creation and imagination, he always gave the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to give her the last kiss on the phone
As soon as her daughter was flagged, she was taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur Hospital 2, where doctors worked to save her life but it was all for nothing.
"Nad was calling regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, which she was not expected to live," said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a call from Nad to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to give her the last kiss.
And so I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicines prescribed by doctors to keep her heart beat were decreasing and slowly leaving her system.
She had died a few times before and started to spoil everything.
All I could do was sit down and wait, knowing that it was all happening.
I couldn’t scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold back."
Eventually Ms Ednan-Laperouse, who was still crying for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane together with the other passengers - who did not know of the difficult situation it was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had a low head, and tears began to come down all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but there was on the flight that I felt a great sense of sympathy towards Nad.
That he needed my love and that we cried.
I knew how much he loved her."
Post cards of women dejected to avoid suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one in suicide are working to prevent others from taking their hands off.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiration messages and telephone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Ms. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Ms Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew for his smile.
They always said that his smile was lighting every room."
However, he had to quit work before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had killed himself.
Ms Davis said: "I fear that this will be the cause of another bad event."
Ms Davis created the cards, "to inform the people that there are people with whom you can open up or meet, even if as a friend.
Don't put it in silence - you need to talk."
Ms Humpreys, who has been a friend to Ms. Davis for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not much after his mother's death.
"He didn't say that he was feeling bad or depressed or so," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day was very bad - when the children opened their gifts did not make any contact with them with his eyes or anything like."
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they want to fight her: "Let alone in the family.
We want to.
But we all have to continue our lives and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is in a precarious situation as the FBI initiates an investigation
"I said, if we could get something like what he asked - a limited investigation in time, limited in scope - we might have brought a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "carried" among the sister's paralysing paralysies.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their return is entirely due to the choice of time.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November - if, as expected, the Republicans do not go well, in that case they will severely weaken their attempts to place the man they want to be elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was taking the phone to call the Senators, to urge them to support Mr. Kavanogh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and by whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, currently occupying 51 Republican and 49 Democrat positions.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, the vice-president, to vote and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
Number of warehouses in North Korea "low" under Kim
The number of North Korean warehouses for South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, saying South Korea's legislator.
When quoting data from the ministry for the unification of South Women, Park Byeong-seug said that last year there were 1,127 changes in the party - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates that were demanding human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comment.
The vast majority of the warehouses from the North Women will inevitably be offered citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most of them escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross compared to the highly protected DMZ area between the two parts of Korea.
China considers depositors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them home with force.
Relations between North and South Women - technically still in war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that were focused on the season of the denuclearisation negotiations.
This took place after the historic meeting of June between the President of the United States of America Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards the Korean nuclear-free peninsula.
But Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Young-ho has applied US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, in no way will we be of the first to eliminate weapons unilaterally," said Mr Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pellosis calls Brett Kavanaugh "sterical," stating that he is not able to work at the Supreme Court
A minority leader of the Chamber Nancy Pelos called the person nominated for the Supreme Court Mr Brett Kavanaugh "sterical" and said that he was not able to work in the Supreme Court due to his temporary behaviour.
Felisis made these comments at a Saturday interview in Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't think of the fact that if a woman had never fought in that way, they would say "sterical," said Pelos about her reaction to the Kavanaugh witnesses before the Judicial Committee of the Thursday Senate.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blassey Ford when both of them were still young.
During his opening statement, Kavanogh was very excited, sometimes even shouting and burning while he was talking about his family and his secondary school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling allegations against him "assassination of the grotteska and coordinated character" organised by the liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pélosi said that she believes that Kavanaugh's witnesses proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, as he showed that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those declarations and the way he went after the Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pélosi responded when she asked whether she tried to justify Kavanaugh if confirmed, and whether the Democrats obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say something -- if he's not telling the truth to the Congress or the FBI, therefore he's not able, not only to be in the Supreme Court, but even to be in the court that is currently in it," said Pelos.
Currently Kavanaugh is a judge at the D.C. Appeal Court.
Pélosi added that as Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as it is considered conservative justice.
In its confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he changed certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not right for a person with royal prejudice to go to court and expect to say, 'Very good'," said Pelos.
And women should exercise their authority.
It is a fair verbal attack, months and years filled with anger, and she cannot say what she should say without crying.
"We cry when we say thank you," she told me the stinem hair 45 years later.
"Don't I think this is a rare thing, what do you say?"
She added, "Give me a lot of woman who was stuck in some other place, who said that even she was crying when she was angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she was angry and started to cry, she would tell the person she was talking to, "Maybe she is thinking that she is sad because I am crying.
I'm angry."
And then he did not stop.
And I thought it was something brilliant."
The crying is allowed as a way to extract its great anger in part because they are fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my most clear memories of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, where I once found myself crying with indescribable anger, was when an older woman caught me from the neck cage - a cool manager who I always feared some of it - and carried me to the straw.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you are sad and happy that they have made you sad."
Patricia Schroeder, who was at that time a member of the Democratic Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was going to leave for the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in a relationship outside the marriage on a boat known as Monkey Business and came out of the election, Ms. Schroeder, very angry, concluded that there was no reason why she did not explore the idea of her own coming out of the presidential election.
"This was not a well-planned decision," she said to me with a smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who would come out for the election, and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and Seventh Nani."
Since this was at the end of the campaign, she was back in fundraising, and therefore he failed to go out for the election if she did not make $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who would have given $1,000 to her men would have given her only $250.
"These think I take some discount?" she said.
When she did her speech where she announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so excited – grateful to the people who supported it, raised her with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and to target the voters instead of the delegates, and starved at sexism - which was burned.
"I probably thought I had these strong brakes," recalled Ms. Schroeder about the way the media responded to her.
"I thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will you write on my grave?
"He cried?"
How the US-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The number of air bombs opening the trade war between the United States and China would have carried you off, and while the battle is still about to end, a lack of agreement between countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, says the experts.
In the absence of any other comments, the Commission concluded that the Union industry's sales volume to the Union increased by 3 % during the period considered.
The most significant increase has come this week with new charges affecting goods amounting to $200 billion (€150 billion), effectively taxing all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has been replanted in the same way each time, while it has been more recently presenting five to ten percent tariffs on US$60 billion.
China has pledged to agree with the US every time, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy of the world will rise in the near future.
The fact that Washington makes a step back means that it accepts requests, but publicly the fact that China exceeds the US will be too embarrassing for some Jiping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing works prudently, US trade war pressures can support China in a positive way in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for starting economic caos in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than that previously acknowledged by the viewers," said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia in the New American Security Centre (Center for New American Security), who is a think tank.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that lasted more than seven years.
When he was speaking to the General Assembly of the single Nations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All the conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees in the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war started in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime welcomes assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the settlement.
Europe embraces the victory of Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won Ryder Cup 2018 against Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutives in European land and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again won the title when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points he needed to win the US.
Phyl Mikkelson who is prominent in the United States, who struggled through all the rogue, gave his tip in the water in the 16 par-3 holes, and thus gave away his game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian Molinari Golfer stands out in all his roundets, and has become 1 out of 4 players who have ever brought 5-0-0 since the beginning of the current tone format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against the at least-level player on the European team, Torbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest-level player, Dustin Johnson, brought 2 and 1 to England's Ian Potter who played in his final Cup Ryder.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio García, became the best European tortoise player ever in his career with 25.5 points.
"We don't usually cry but today I couldn't hold.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I am very happy, very happy to get back the cup.
The team is everything, and I'm glad that I could help," said García excited after the European victory.
He's going through the tortoise to his comparioted partner John Ram who won the U.S. golf legend Tinger Woods 2&1 in Kings play Sunday.
"The incredible pride that I feel, that I won Tigger Woods, when I was raised to follow it," said Rahm 23 years old.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of Ryder Cup 13-21-3 during his career.
Strange statistics of one of the best players ever here, which won 14 headlines, second after only Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA has struggled all the way to find those parts of the golf track with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high calibre golf during the entire tour.
The U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his team, "I am proud of these men, they fight.
There was a time this morning when pressure was lifted on Europe.
We have been arrested.
To Thomas we call him.
He is a very good captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We will reunite, I will work with our American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
To these 12 young men I love and I am proud to be a master.
You have to catch the chapel and shake your head.
Play better than it."
Red Tide update: The concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report by Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows an overall decrease in Red Tide concentrations for parts of the Campa Bay area.
According to the FWC, conditions for excessive algal growth in isolated areas are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - suggesting reductions in concentrations.
The Red Tide which is an excessive growth of alka extends around 130 miles of the coast from the top of Pinellas to the countries below Lee.
Isolated areas can be found around 10 miles off the coast of Hilsborough County, but at fewer sites related to last week.
Red Tide has also been observed in Pasco County.
In the absence of any other comments, the Commission concluded that there was no evidence that the measures in question had been in place and that the measures had been taken had not been taken.
