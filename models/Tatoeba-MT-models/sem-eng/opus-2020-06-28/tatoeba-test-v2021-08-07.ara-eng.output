I didn't buy a pair of shoes for six months; I deserve a new husband, so I think I'm gonna go buy them.
I didn't think Tom could be very tough.
Why did you give money to someone like her?
I didn't know how to answer his question.
I didn't give him any attention.
I didn't know she was sick.
I didn't know Tom had to do it himself.
I didn't know about that.
As for calm in the room, only an old voice can be heard.
I didn't understand that explanation.
I didn't mean to do that.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I never meant for this to happen.
I didn't mean anything!
I didn't mean to.
I didn't say my last word!
Why would I say anything?
I never ate Chinese food.
I haven't eaten since I fell, and I'm very hungry.
I didn't expect this to happen.
I didn't want to hide the hopes of Sami.
I didn't want to make any noise.

I didn't mean to disappoint her.
I wasn't gonna tell him.
I wasn't aware of her illness.
I wasn't aware of her illness.
I wouldn't have done it without your help.
I wasn't sure what was going on.
I wasn't alone.
Why don't you forget it and leave it alone?
I didn't play golf yet.
Why didn't you come to dinner?
Why didn't you come to the food?
Why didn't you come?
Why didn't you tell her?
Why are you so selfish?
Why are you alone?
Why are you crying?
Why are you crying?
Why are you in a hurry?
Why are you so rude?
I've never regretted anything I've done.
I didn't forget.
I haven't finished my duties yet.
Because of the 966 experiment, Dema had begun to despair.
Now, I can't focus on my work at all!
She didn't come before the second.
You didn't cry?
The car didn't move.
The idea didn't give rise to Samy's admiration.
You haven't told me why you decided not to go.
She didn't realize her fault.
You didn't see a doctor?
Why did you leave me?
You didn't marry him?
You didn't ask?
Lily didn't deserve to die.

Details weren't ready directly.
It wasn't the first time.
She wasn't Sami's wife's daughters who loved him.
She didn't know where she was.
That wasn't the truth.
It wasn't my fault.
That disk crunch wasn't enough to kill Sami.
I didn't have any nails.
I had no secret life at all.
The police had no other evidence against Lily.
Lily wouldn't have answered.
Lily wasn't in love with him.
It wasn't one fight, it was more.
There wasn't nearly between Sami and Lily.
You didn't lie to Lily and you'd adopt a wild life.
She didn't have any money, so she couldn't go with me.
You didn't sleep in a place like this?
You haven't finished your coffee.
Never happened.
You didn't go there without me?
Why would we want to do that?
Why did you call Tom his car there?
Why did you stick to me?
Why should I do this myself?
Why did you say that?
Why was that?
Why all this?
Why not?
Why don't you eat vegetables?
Why don't you sit down and rest?
Why don't you visit us?
Why don't you accept that?
Why don't you tell him that?
Why don't we eat lunch together?
Why didn't you try to call us?
Why didn't you let him in?
Why didn't you answer my phone?
You haven't moved yet?
Why didn't he send me any messages anymore?

Why aren't you coming with us?
Didn't we just stop at a kiss?
Why are we hiding?
We haven't seen him anywhere.
We didn't see what we wanted to see.
We couldn't find anything about my grandmother and my grandmother.
We never heard it sing.
We didn't believe it.
We weren't happy.
Who's this guy?
Who are these books?
Who are these paintings?
Who are these shoes?
Why is this so important?
He hasn't come yet.
Nobody came.
Tom didn't come to the party last night.
No one authorized.
There's nothing left in the refrigerator.
Why did the woman even sneeze there?

Sami hasn't even read a letter to Lily.
It's only the most mature love I've ever had.
You didn't tell me even one word.
Didn't the French hate this lady?
It wasn't her name on the list.
It was just us.

If something fun, I'd like to do it, of course.
If only I'd been a little longer!
If that is true, we'll accept that conclusion.
If I told you the truth, you'd be surprised.
If I were you, would I have done the same thing?
If it wasn't for your help to fail my father.
If I didn't help her, I wouldn't be alive right now.
