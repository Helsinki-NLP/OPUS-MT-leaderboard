Members of Parliament in Wales are afraid to look like rags.
Some members of Parliament were alarmed by the suggestion that their role title would be changed from AMs to MWPs.
This fear woke up following plans to change the name of the metre for the Welsh Police.
Members of Parliament all over the political bow are worried that it's going to be a holiday.
One member of the Labour Party said that his men were afraid that "it would rush with Twp and with Pwp."
It means stupid and-- pwp means poo.
A member of a Parliament from the Party of Floyd Camry said that all his friends were "not satisfied" and offered alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Guardian Party said that his friends "open to proposals" about the change of name, but he pointed out that the name MWP was very similar to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Vulcan signal is echoed in the form of the sign and in English in the Yukshire accent.
The House of Lawmakers Committee, which is currently instituting legislation for names changes, said: "The final decision about every word is a description of the names of the members of the House of Lawmakers, of course, of the members of the house of the legislators themselves."
The Wales government law of 2017 gave the Polish legislature the authority to change his name.
In June, the committee published the results of the consultations with the public on the proposals, which gave broad support to changing the name of the House of Lawmakers to the Welsh Point.
As for the title title of the role of the members of the Parliament (AMs), the committee recommended that the members of the Walsh Parliament or the heads of WMPs, but the MWP option received most of the support in consultation with the public.
The members of the Parliament offer alternative options, but the struggle to get a Concenzius can cause quite a headache to the president of the committee, Ellen Jones, who is supposed to submit a legislative draft on the changes in the next few weeks.
The law on the promotion of other changes in the work of the legislature, including rules for the removal of members of Parliament and the construction of the committee system.
The vote of the members of the Parliament is that you will eventually set out the title of their role when the case is discussed.
The citizens of Macedonia are going to the cards in question with a change in the name of the country.
The citizens will vote on Sunday to ask whether to change their country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The people's wish was set out in an attempt to resolve a ten - year - old dispute with the neighboring Greek, where there was a district called Macedonia.
Greece has long claimed that its neighbor from the north was in a dispute over the territory of Greece and back and opposed Macedonia's attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, who opposed the people's question about the change of name, said he'd ignore his results.
However, those who support the demands of the people, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is just the price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent and present the difficulties of the churches in the Harlem community
According to Mr. Adams, "the old neighborhood residents say there were a bar and a church in every corner."
"Now there are no bars and no churches."
He says it's possible to understand the disappearance of bar.
"People's society life is going differently," he said.
"Barbars are no longer the neighborhood living room where people visit on a permanent basis."
As for the churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of property will not survive for as long as the church leaders expect, “and sooner or later, they will find themselves again at the beginning”.
According to him, the churches will take up residence buildings with shared homes that house people who are not the kind to help the churches maintain their unique character.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he says, "so this will undermine the closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that most people who move to these houses will join these churches."
Two churches were built by faith - building communities, before Harlem became the neighborhood of most of its black colony - a Communist Metropolitan Church in 1870, and St. Martin 10 years later.
The White Buddhist Community left in the 30s of the previous century.
A community that believes in black has become the owner of the building.
The Church of St. Martin moved into a community of black believers under priest John Howard Johnson, who led a raid on traders on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or advance black people.
The fires in 1939 caused heavy damage to the building, but as part of the plans of priests Johnson to rebuild it, they invited the bell block building.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Johnson the father, and who inherited his place in the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the Church the Bells of the Poor.
Specialist in July's clinic called him "cultural treasure" and "historic vessel with no replacement."
The expert, Tipney Ing of Michigan University, also mentioned that it was the first bell projector in the world to be protected by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who continued to play the biggest instrument at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Marveithr said that the Church of St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened at St. Martin's church over the past few months has been a complex story of architects and contractors, some of whom were brought by local church leaders, others by the physicophilic language.
The assembly — the governing body of the local faiths community — wrote a letter in July, expressing its concern that the bishops would try to roll the costs to the meeting, even though the meeting was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the bishops.
Some of the believers complained about the lack of witnessing.
A shark wounded a 13-year-old boy in a lobster trap.
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old on a Saturday while the boy was climbing up to catch lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, so they were given official reasons.
The attack took place a little before 7:00 a.m., near the beach of Buchanan Benenitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV network in San Diego that he ran off with friends about an hour ago on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy screaming for help, then he went out there with a group to help carry him to the beach.
Hammer initially thought it was just the enthusiasm for the lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I was bitten!
I'm biting!"
Hamel said that when he got close to the boy, he saw that "all of his hair was removed."
I yelled at everyone to get out the water, 'There's a shark in the water!' added the camel.
The boy was flew to Rady Hospital in San Diego, where he was defined as a human being.
It's not known which shark species attacked the boy.
The rescue commander Larry Giles said in a press briefing that a shark was identified in a region several weeks earlier, but we're going to say it's not a dangerous adult shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
The authorities closed access to the beach between Punto Coast in Xbalad and Suami in Scinnitas for 48 hours for investigations and safety reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them aren't considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to market beauty products in Britain
Sainsbury's starting a competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and opening up dog shop style with professionally selling women.
As part of a significant initiative to market beauty products in Britain, which runs 2.8 billion strilings a year, and which continues to grow while sales in fashion and homemade industries are running down, the vast branches of beauty products will be tested at 11 stores across the country and if the experiment succeeds, they will be added to other stores next year.
The investment in beauty products comes while the vendors pick up other ways to use the paper space that has been captured by TVs, microwaves, and household products.
From the Sainsburi's stated that the company was expected to double its beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Esie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPow for the first time in her history.
The existing product lines of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees have even more to do with specific brand areas like those that exist in shops like Boots.
The Merchant Network also re-establishs its Boutique makeup line so that most products will be friendly to the vegans, a characteristic that has built up a bridge among young buyers.
In addition, Fragrace Shop's network of perfumes will check the winnings in both Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened in Croyden, South London, last week, and the second will open in Sly Ok, Barmingham, at a later date of the year.
Internet shopping and access to the purchase of small amounts of food more every day in local comfort shops are forced to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coopa, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the branches would become more bloody for his dog shops while the stockings are trying to fight against Aldi and Lidl networks with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has added sales points of Argos in hundreds of stores as well as a number of Habitat points since the purchase of two networks two years ago, adding that they have raised sales of the supplier's products and made acquisitions more profitable.
Previously, the network's attempts to revive the beauty products and their pharmaceuticals have ended with failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the call ended after a disagreement about how to share the profits from the pharmaceuticals inside the market.
The new strategy comes after the Sainsbury's sold the commercial activity of the pharmaceutical houses in 281 Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds network for 125 million striling years ago.
She said that Lloyds played a role in the program, by expanding the branding of expensive leather products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
The commercial manager of Sainsbury's, Paul Mills-Hicks, said: "We made a reverse in the mirror and sense of the passage of our beauty products, to improve the environment for the customers.
In addition, we invested in specially trained workers who would be available for advice instead.
Our brands are designed to adapt to all the needs and environments of our comfortable and attractive places making us attractive targets for the acquisition of beauty products, in a way that would challenge the old ways of buying goods."
Peter Jones is angry after Holly Willaby canceled a 11 million-dollar deal.
Dragos Den, Peter Jones, showed "wrath" after the TV show Holly Willaby cancelled a 11 million-dollar deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new campaign with Mark And Spencer and ITV.
Actually, Willowby doesn't have time to brand their house clothes and accessories.
The joint business of the two is considered to be the same as the Goop brand of actress Gwynth Paltro.
The 37-year-old commentator of the program, The Morning, announced her departure at Post-Stegram.
Holly Willaby left the Dragos Den Peter Jones program planet angry that in the last minute she had cancelled her participation in the standard of living of the two -- to focus on her fat arms with Mark And Spencer and ITV.
Sources said that "Vance responded in anger" when the TV star announced a storm meeting on Tuesday in the main offices of his commercial empire in Marlo, Bakinga-Zirir, whose new transactions - in the amount of up to 1.5-strling - did not have enough time to dedicate to their clothes and accessories Truly.
The joint business of the two was considered to be like the Goop brand of actress Gwynth Paltro and was expected to double Willavi's fortune, which we'll learn at 11 million stralings.
While the 37-year-old Willaby was published in Instegram that she was leaving Truly, Jones was on a British flight to one of his own homes.
According to one of the sources, "Truly was undoubtedly at the top of Holly's priorities.
It was supposed to be her future for the long term that would provide her with income in the next few decades.
Decided to leave completely intruding all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
The Marlo company warehouses are full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of The Horning, which is one of the most profitable stars in Britain, could cost a company millions of dollars as a result of massive investments in various products, from mines to candles to house clothes, and potential for further delays in the launch.
And that might bring a long end to friendship.
Willavi, who is a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
Willavi set up Truly with Kapp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the company chairman in March.
The couple spent vacations together and Jones owns 40% of Bedwin's TV production company.
Willabi will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ann McFerlin as a platform on the I'm A Celebrity program of ITV.
A close source to Jones said last night, "We're not responding to his business affairs."

He joked about the review he's getting from the news press on statements that are classified as "unsanity" and that he's so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump do so many compromises?
Trump said in the voice of a new pitcher.
"I didn't give up."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in a second meeting after he had removed their first meeting in June as a major step towards the nuclear-weapon-free movement of North Korea.
But the negotiation of the detonation of nuclear weapons is frozen.
More than three months after the June summit meeting in Singapore, the senior diplomat from North Korea, R. Yong Ho, told world leaders on Saturday at the U.S. General Assembly, that North Korea does not see a "successful reaction" from the U.S. to the initial arms-clearing steps it has undertaken in North Korea.
Instead, according to the U.S., the United States continues with sanctions that are intended to continue the pressure.
Trump took the point of view a lot more optimistic in his speech at the stop.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We almost went to war in the north of Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results -- the cessation of missile experiments, aiding in the release of prisoners and the return of the remains of American soldiers home.
And he protected his extraordinary attitude in his speech about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be my presidents, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full stadium, we had about 200 people standing there," said Trump when he was pointing right in front of him.
Tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia have caused the destruction of an island and the killing of hundreds of people.
After an earthquake in Bloomb, for example, non-governmental foreign organizations were told that their help was unnecessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombock's population lost their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is the condition for international aid.
Unfortunately, they were very clear that they didn't ask for international assistance, so it's a bit of a challenge, said Mrs. Sobong.
Although Argo Save the Children prepares a team that travels to Palo, it's not clear yet if foreign missionaries can move into the field.
Mr. Sotopo, director of the Agency for National Disasters, said that the Indonesian authorities were working to assess the situation in Palo to see if more international services could contribute to the relief effort.
In the light of endless earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is unfortunately insufficiently prepared for natural disasters.
While tsunami shelters were built in the Acha district, they are rare in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the obvious lack of warnings about shanami in Palo, although there is a warning, has contributed to the loss of the soul.
Even in the best of times, the journey between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complex.
A hospital ship built in Bloombock to treat earthquake victims is making its way to Palo, but it'll take her at least three days to get to the new disaster area.
The terrible population improvement of Indonesia is located at the centre of President Wiko Woodado's election campaign, and it has invested many funds in roads and railways.
But Mr. Goeko is standing by with funding for his next year's re-election.
Mr. Goeco is also faced with the pressure of class societies continuing in Indonesia as a result of the religious depreciation process of most Muslims in the country.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have lost their homes in fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets - using knives, bows, and other domestic weapons.
Video: Daniel Severig from the Liverpool Group from the last minute in front of Chelsea.
Daniel Sterridge saved Liverpool from the loss of Lassie Primier League with the 89th check gate at Stamford Bridge in London.
Squirrig got a delivery from the Shakari office when he was about 30 feet from the gate of Chelsea and his group in P. 1-0.
He jumped the ball to his left and then turned a kick toward the remote castle.
The ball flew high above the floor and landed toward the top right corner of the network.
The ball finally landed above the gate of Kappa Aribelga that was thrown into his path, and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get to this position, get to the ball and play the game like Shack always plays forward as far as possible, so I was just trying to create myself as much time as possible," told Sredig to locate LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Canta and I made one touch and I didn't think too much of it and I just kicked."
Chesie led 0-1 in half after the blue star Edan left a gate for the 25th minute.
The "Blue" swap transferred a boat back to Mato Kobachich in the same game, before moving near the middle of the field and running fast into the half-field of Liverpool.
Kobach's made a quick maneuver in the middle of the field.
Then he kicked a beautiful cross, bringing the alien into the open.
The former aliens ran off the defense and finished the ball inside the top right corner of the gate, with the left kick passing the Liverpool Becker player.

From where the deaths in tsunamis in Indonesia cost 832
From where the deaths in the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia took place to 832, so the country's disaster agency announced on Sunday morning.
Many people reported that they were trapped in the destruction of buildings that had collapsed by the earthquake of 7.5 on Friday and caused waves of up to six feet [6 m], and that the agency's address, Sotopo Foro, had been shown at a press conference.
The city of Palo, where more than 380,000 inhabitants were living, was covered with debris from buildings that collapsed.
The police arrested a 32-year-old male for murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The police opened a murder investigation after a woman's body was found in Buchend this morning, Marzide.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. on John Street when she was stabbed, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police call people from the area who saw or heard something to turn to.
Inspector of Detective Brian O'Hagan's message: "The investigation is in the beginning, but I want to alert anyone who was next to John's street in Birchand and saw or heard anything suspicious, to turn to us.
I would also like to ask every person, especially cab drivers, who may have filmed something in a car camera, to contact us -- because the photos may include information that is necessary for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman who was found dead lived in Birchand and that she was found inside a building.
The scene came this afternoon with friends who thought they knew the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues while the police have announced that they are now in the process of sending messages to relatives.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mese just tried to get into his apartment, but he was told that the police had forbidden anyone to enter or leave the building.
He was shocked when she found out what happened.
The tenants are now told to spend more hours until they get back to their apartments.
A cop sounds like telling one man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman was seen in the scene when she was plunging.
She repeats and says, "It's terrible."
At 2:00, two police trucks were observed inside the scene and another one across it.
A couple of cops stood inside the scene when they set up people in the apartment building.

Cromwell's Parliament statue became the next target for attacks on memory conditions in the struggle around "historic".
The statue syllable will be a poetic justice to the Italian syllables that have been performed by the Buddhist supporters so many cultural and religious art objects in England.
But in the Cromwell Society, they say Mr. Creek's offer is "soft" and "trying to write history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current dispute over the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell's character standing outside the Westminster Palace will become a target.
The splintering of the statues of the English civil war was not done at Cromwell's command and was not carried out by him.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell was victimized because of the actions of one of his predecessors - Thomas Cromwell - in the century before.
The impressive representation of Cromwell in the hands of the statue Sir William Hammão Turnicroft is testimony to an exhibition in the 19th century and some of the history of a figure that many think still deserve to pay for.
Mr. Goldsmith said to the Sandi Telegraph newspaper: "Cromole was caught by many, perhaps more than today at the end of the 19th century, as he defended the Parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the kingdom.
The question of whether this is a completely accurate assessment is subject to an ongoing historical debate.
A fact that doesn't give a shit is that the struggle in the middle of the 17th century designed our nation's further development, and Cromwell is one identified character representing one side of the devastating at the time.
His achievements as the shielded Lord also deserve honor and victory."
A deadly pig who travels a Chinese farmer to death.
Local media sources report an attack on a farmer on the market in southwestern China.
The man, who was named his family Ivan, was found dead with a cold artery covered with blood near the pig-shop in the Lopsenwey market in Gwijow County, so the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A farmer is preparing to inject pigs into pigs on May 30, 2005, in Shining County, China.
According to reports, he traveled on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yoonan to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and he found a door to an open pig apartment.
He said that Dre was found a big male pig with blood on his mouth.
A criminal investigation confirmed that the pig weighing 250 pounds attacked the farmer, according to the report.
"My uncle's feet were full of blood and excitement," said the cousin of his family name Wu, as quoted in the Guying Events News.
On security camera photos, it looks like Joan entered the market on Thursday morning at 4.40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to a van or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked behind bars and running to prevent him from attacking other people, while the police picked up evidence at the scene.
He was reportedly negotiating with the market authorities from his family for compensation for his death.
Despite a rare phenomenon, cases in which pigs attacked humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused human injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 30-pound pig had a farmer's bracelet in Wales to his tractor until the farmer's wife escaped the animal.
After a farmer in Orson was taken over by his pigs in 2012, one farmer in her favor told the CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but that blood taste could be a "treager".
They're just playing.
They're like naughty kids, very surveying... They're not going to hurt you.
We just have to give them the right amount of respect, he said.
The hurricane remains of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rains in vast areas south-west of the United States.
According to the front line, the hurricane Rosa was weakened as it moved over the colder waters on the north coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
However, the storm Rosa brings my body of sights all over North Mexico and Southwest of the United States over the next few days.
The winds at the Rosa storm came at a speed of 135 miles per hour, which means a hurricane storm at stage 1, and it was reached on Sunday at 5:00 a.m. on the east coast watch, the storm track was found at 620 miles south-east of Punta Eugena, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it is beginning to create a Pacific above the Pacific Ocean that is heading east towards the east coast of the United States, with the mass-to-be battles at the sister of California on two days in the shape of a tropical storm, which will start pushing deep tropics north into the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 miles of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, a tropical crop that combines with the approaching nature of heavy rains in vast areas in the south-west of the United States over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 100 millimetres of rain will result in a slight flood and the risk of landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will cause the rain to reach 50 to 75 miles per hour at various points, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Rains of 50 to 100 millimetres are expected in parts of the Southwest of the United States, especially in Arizona.
We'll be able to get a little relief under conditions that are rapidly deteriorating because of the flow of tropical rain.
It is highly recommended to avoid walking long distances in the desert when there is danger of tropical rain.
A heavy rain can become a cannon for a stormy river, and thunderous storms can bring strong winds of tears and dust.
The approaching output will bring local rains to parts of Southern California's coast.
We'll make a total amount of rains of over 13 millimetres, which could cause waste disposal and smooth roads.
It'll be the first rain in this rainy season.
Transient tropical rain showers will start approaching Arizona on Sunday and Monday morning, and the rain will grow and spread over Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread to four corners on Tuesday and last on Wednesday.
In October, there may be sharp temperature changes throughout the United States, while the Arctic region cools but the tropics remain pretty hot.
This situation often leads to dramatic changes in temperature between short distances.
On Sunday, there's an excellent example of extreme temperature changes across the United States center.
There's a temperature difference of almost 10 degrees between Kenns City, Mizo and her mother, Nebraska, and St. Louis for Dea Moin, Iowa.
In the next few days, prolonged summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
At the beginning of October, temperatures would be warm in most central and eastern parts of the United States, moving between 27 and 31 degrees south and north-east.
In New York City the temperature can reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 5 degrees above the average.
Long-term weather forecast shows high temperatures than average in the East U.S. in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people were watching Bert Kwano's hearing
More than 20 million people were expected on Thursday, on six television networks, in the fascinating testimony of the Supreme Court candidate, Bert Kwano, and the woman who charged him with sexual assault allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blazzy Ford.
Meanwhile, the political conflict continued, with news flashing in the middle of regular broadcasts to announce a dramatic development on Friday: an agreement by Senator Marizona G.F.P.P.P.A. that will conduct a week-old investigation into the charges.
Ford told St.'s Legal Committee that she's 100% safe that Kwano's biting her body when he's drunk and trying to get her out during a high school party.
Kwano, in excited testimony, said he was 100% safe that it didn't happen.
It's likely that the audiences were even higher than the 20.4 million watchers reported by the Nielsen Index.
Nielsen tested the average view of the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC networks.
The data were not available immediately for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and - Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen is usually having trouble checking people at the offices.
For comparison, this is about the size of the football game or the Oscar ceremony.
According to Nielsen data, Fox News Channel, who has been an enthusiastic supporter of the Kawano appointment, has led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long hearing.
ABC was second placed with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS had 3.1 million, the NBC had 2.94 million, the MSNBC had 2.89 million and the CNN had 2.52 million, according to the NISN report.
The level of interest remained high after the hearing.
Senator Flyke was the main figure in the drama he was born on Friday.
After the office of the distinguished Republican Senator issued a message that he would vote for the appointment of Kawano, he was filmed by CNN and CBS photographers when a group of protestors yelled at him while trying to get into the elevator to get a hearing on the Legal Committee.
He's been looking down for a few minutes while the protestors were exaggerating him, when all of this was filmed live on CNN.
"I'm standing here before you," said one of the women.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are so helpless."
Felix said that his survivor posted a message and said, before the elevator door was closed, that he would say more things in the hearing at the committee.
The transmission and cable networks all broadcasted live hours later, when the Legal Committee was about to point to the presentation of Quano's candidacy for the St.
But Felix said he would vote for appointment only on condition that the FBI would understand the charges against the candidate during the next week, which the democratic minority members wanted.
Felix is partially convinced of conversations with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Kons.
After a conversation with a conspiracy and several senators later, Felix made his decision.
Felix's decision had power, because it was clear that Republicans wouldn't be mostly able to confirm Kavano's appointment without an investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kwano.
Head of the British government, Teresa May, accused the visitors of playing politics on the Barkzit.
Prime Minister Teresa Mei accused her U.S. U.S. for leaving the European Union of playing politics with the future of Britain and affected the national Internet, in an interview given to the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa Mey comes to the Biramingham March 29th September 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, continued to attack her "Dammit game" program, saying that Britain and the European Union would turn this cover off.
The police arrested Diton Simpson as a suspect in the LSU player's murder.
Police arrested a suspect at the deadly shootings at Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player who played in the LSU team.
A 20-year-old man named Dayton Simpson was arrested and charged with murder at first degree, so he was identified by the Batton Rog Police.
Officials published a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses in the scene and said that Simpson's DNA was found on them, according to a WAFB network report, which is part of the CBS network.
After the Simpson investigation, according to the police, he admitted to shooting Wade to death.
The bail fee was set at $350,000, as reported in Advocate.
The pathological institute of East Baton Rose published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death is a gunshot wound in the head and into the neck.
The police gave credit to the task force to hunt fugitive criminals at the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Military Laboratory, the United Nations University Police, and civilians in the area that assisted in the investigation of the suspect.
The director of ethics at LSU University, Joe Alva, admitted the law enforcement authorities in the area to "demonstration and the pursuit of justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The Forward basketball, which was over two feet tall, grew up in Baton Rose, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU University.
His average previous season is 5.6 points and 2.6 rounds back.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach, Will Wade, said that the team was "sudden" and "bum" from Wade's death.
"That's what you're afraid of all the time," said Wade.
Mount Polt ash on Mexico City
A soil that was blown off the volcano Popocteptal came to the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for the Prevention of Disasters warned the inhabitants of Mexico on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity at the mountain level had been reduced and 183 gas and ashes had been registered within 24 hours.
In the middle of a number of noises and earthquakes.
Photos on social networks showed minutes of ashes cover on car fats in Mexico City, such as Sochimilako.
Geophysicists have noticed an increased activity in the south-east 72 km (45 km) volcano to the capital, since an earthquake of 7.1 powered Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Guo, has been active since 1994.
The conflict between the police and minor toxins in approaching the anniversary of the vote for independence.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the self-supporting protestors engaged with police forces in the protest zone, and thousands more joined in demonstrations against the first anniversary of the party's vote on Catholic independence.
A group of masked buckets were swallowed by the officers to spread the demonstrations, put eggs on the cops, and cast paint powder, to create black dust clouds on the streets, which are usually watery.
Conflicts broke out later that day when the police had to use the gods to overcome the protestors.
For a number of hours, independent groups of supporters who said, "Let's not forget, we won't forgive" against the supporters of the unit who called it "the brother of Spain".
In the local press, 14 people were reported to have been treated for minor injuries inflicted by protestors.
The lacunae remained high in the areas of the independent people a year after the question of the people held on October 1 was handed down by the Government of Spain, but was celebrated by independent Catholic priests.
The voters chose most of the votes to become independent, even though the voting was low when those who opposed the separation of the majority took the vote.
The authorities in Catalonia reported that nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the voting in cards across the region in violent conflicts.
Independent groups set up a night camp on Friday to prevent national police from showing support.
The demonstration was in place, but it had to go on a different track.
Narcisse Herms, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in protesting with his wife, said he had lost hope of receiving independence from Catalan.
Last year we experienced our best moments.
I saw my parents crying happy for them to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan differentials won an important victory, in their last December elections, they tried to maintain the momentum of the year when many of their most well-known leaders were in voluntary exiles or prisons waiting to be judged on their part in the People's Worship Organization and following its independent course.
Juan Foige, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police support demonstration on his phone, said that the riots were fought by politicians on both sides of the rudder.
He said, "It's going and it's gone," he said.
On Saturday, Oriel Yonkers, one of the nine minority leaders who have been in prison waiting for trial since last year, announced that he would face the election to the European Parliament next year.
"Sustaining as a candidate for European elections is the best way to impose its position on the democratic values and the oppression we would have witnessed to him from the Spanish government," he said.
Londondrey: A number of men were arrested after a car hit the house.
Three men, aged 33.34 and 39.
The event took place in Blenagage Christ on Thursday around 19:30, according to British clock.
Detective Bob Bellamings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
It may also be at some point that a bow arrow has been shot to the back of the car.
Manga's kick gives Livingstone a 1-0 win on Rang's.
Dolly Manga's first gate for Livingstone promised victory
Livingston, who only went up to the League, amazed Rang's and Amanda Stephen Jared that it was just his second loss in 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Manga's beating meant a lot because Gary Holt's team moved up with Hibernian in the second place.
Gerar's team is left without victory outside the home of the top-season League, and you'll deal with the lead Harts, who's behind eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rang's gonna host Raffid Vienna at the European League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingstone's extension of the losing-out sequence at the home of six games, and Chief Coach Holt has not had a break since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone missed opportunities in front of a weak guest group.
Holt's group was supposed to lead long before the gate was opened, when their directity caused Lang's problems.
Scott Robinson hacked forward but dragged his experiments ahead of a gate, and then Alan Lili, Guy, could focus his efforts only around after he slipped in to meet Craig Hegett's contact before the gate.
The hosts were willing to let Ranger play in front of them, knowing they could make it difficult for the group to stay in free kicks.
And it was the way that the necessary gate was opened.
Rang's took a free kick and Livingston created an opening, Declan Galager and Robinson joined in blocking Manga, who touched on and raised a gate from the center of the vast area.
At this point, the rang's dominated the ball but found the house's protection to be uninvited, and gate Liam Kelly remained almost uninvited.
This pattern goes into the second half, although Alfredo Morlos did force Kelly to save the gate.
Scott Pittnam was struck by the legs of the Rang's Lan'Alan McGurregre and left a ghetto in another Livingstone's free kick.
Triangled pills continued to enter Livingstone's width and sink, while two penalty pills were kept away after the curse on the replacement Glen Middleton, and one on the touch of hand - were removed.
From Livingstone.
Elstier to Mont, BBC Scotland at Tony Macrony Stadium
An amazing game and an amazing result from Livingstone.
All actors were excellent, and they continued to look forward to this up.
Their style of play and the character of the players have almost never changed since they returned to the lead position, but there's got to be a lot of credit to dominate the way he's helped the team since it arrived.
He had so many stars.
Captain Holket was awesome, and he led a very well-organized defense, while Manga kept Connor Goldson and J. Warel on high paths all along the way.
But the rang's were uninspired.
Although they were sometimes pretty good under Gerar, they didn't follow these standards.
They were missing the final ball -- only once they opened the home team's defense -- and that's a red lang's shooter, who found themselves in the middle of the field.
A welcome involved in Ardowan Callen.
There were blue smiles and skys when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on Saturday (29 September) for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdowan's controversial visit to Germany, whose purpose was to repair the relationship between the two countries of the NATO Alliance.
They were ideas about issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's admission to the European Union.
That's where Erdowan continued to participate in the opening of a new huge mosque.
Klein is the city of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police declared safety reasons for public fronting 25,000 people from gathering on the front of the mosque, but many supporters stood by to see Usam.
Hundreds of protestors — many of them Kurdish — also voiced their voices, protesting against the policy lines of Erdowan and deciding to welcome them to Germany in the country.
The opposing protestors reflect the controversy surrounding the guest who some Turks in Germany glorify him as a hero and others defend him as a fan.
Bedford's car accident: A bike rider was killed in a collision with a car
A bike rider was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision will take place near the street corner of Studwood and Evelyn, the Amous Road in Daptford, south-east of the city, around 10:15, according to British clock.
The car driver stopped and the wearers took care of the wound, but the man died instead.

Six guards were treated for injuries.
We don't accept violence in our prisons, and we're clear that those involved are going to call the police and their prison terms can be extended."
The prison in Long Lartin houses 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the governor of the prison was reportedly treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the protest officers were called to the prison to deal with a severe riot in which guards were attacked in the snowcracker cans.
Hurricane Rosa's storm is threatening a slight supply of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's rare that a tropic investment hits Arizona, but that's exactly what's expected to happen at the beginning of next week, when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa storm will cross the desert in the south-east and bring with them a risk of short supply.
The National Weather Service has already declared the danger of a severe supply in the second and third days for West Arizona to the south-east of Nevada, south-east of California and Wuta, including the towns of Phoenix, Flagastaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The storm Rosa is expected to go straight over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching by Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has published a twitter that only ten tropiclon storms have survived in the status of a tropic storm or a tropic stout within a distance of 322 miles from Pinix since 1950!
Catarina ( 1967) was a hurricane storm within a distance of 64 miles of Arizona border."
The latest models of Arizona's hurricane terminal are watching 50 to 100 millimetres of rain, with a isolated amount of up to 150 millimeters in Arizona's Moagolon.
Other parts of the South-West desert, including the central and great rock mountains, are expected to receive 25 to 50 millimetres [50 m], with the possibility of isolated places that will take up to 50 inches [50 m].
To those outside the danger zone of flash flood, the rain of a Rosa storm could be a blessing because the area suffered a collapse.
Although supply is a serious danger, some of these rains will help because the southwest region is currently suffering from a form of conditions.
According to the U.S. cast surveillance, over 40% of Arizona is in a tough shape, which is the second category in its range, so the weather.com site is reported.
First, the route of a Rosa storm will reach the mainland across the island of Brother California in Mexico.
A Rosa storm, still at the power of a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 13 miles per hour, is 620 miles south of Ponta Yug'na, Mexico, and heading north at an speed of about 20 miles per hour.
The storm hits colder waters in the Pacific, and that's why it's weakened.
Thus, she is expected to reach the mainland in Mexico at the power of a tropical storm in the afternoon or on Monday evening.
The rains across parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a threat to strong relief.
A total of 75 to 150 millimetres are expected from California to the northwest of Sonora, with a potential for up to 250 millimetres, reporting the weather.com site.
Then a rosé storm will continue into Mexico Tropic money, before you reach the Arizona border in the early third morning hours of a trophie, which will then continue over Arizona into South jute on Tuesday night.
The main danger facing Rosa, or from the rest of her, is heavy rains in Ha'ha, Southwest Sonora, and south-west desert in the United States, the message of the National Center for Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to cause a severe flood and to spread life - threatening scourges in the desert, as well as landslides in the mountainous regions.

Trump said that Kwano suffered the evils and anger of the Democratic Party
"The vote in favor of Judge Kwano is the vote to put down the terrible winds and tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a stop in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kwano suffered the wrath of the Democratic Party throughout the entire process of his appointment.
Kwano testified to the Congress on Thursday, denying with intensity the accusation of Christine Blaise Ford that he had sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified to a hearing about her guilt.
The president said Saturday, "The People of the United States have seen the blessings and qualities and courage" of Quano that day.
"The vote to confirm the appointment of Judge Quano is a vote to confirm the appointment of one of the most prestigious legal powers of our time, a judge with an excellent record of public service," he told the audience his supporters in West Virginia.
The president has taken a close look at Kwano's appointments when he talks about the importance that Republicans will be able to vote for the mid-prime election.
Five more weeks until one of the most important votes in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm actually a candidate, he said.
That's why I run everywhere to fight for great candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a "resistance and interference".
A senior assistant of the Republican Party is a message to the CNN that the first executive vote of the Senate on the appointment of Quano is expected to take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of dead in an earthquake and a tsunami in Indonesia, and the number rises.
At least 384 people were killed, many of them swept through vast waves crashing on the coasts, as a severe earthquake and tsunami struck the Soviet island, so official sources reported on Saturday.
Very many people were gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palo on Friday, when waves carrying a height of six feet (18 feet) crashed on the beach during the summer, and many carried away to their death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake in the strength of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat woke up yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach and not immediately escaped, and they fell victim," said Sotopo Porvo Noroho, the BNPB disaster management agency, in an Akata manual.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, he dragged cars, loggers, houses, he hit everything on the ground," said Noraho, adding that the waiters went over the open sea at a speed of 500 miles (497 miles per hour) before he hit the beach.
Some of the people took care of trees to escape from the tsunamis and they survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people turned to 24 centers in Palo.
Air photographs released by the disaster agency have shown destruction of a large number of houses and shops, powerful bridges and courses and a mosque surrounded by water.
Screaming kept shaking the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) in Indonesia noted that the energy released at the 6th World War was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb on hexium in World War II.
According to him, the town's geography, sitting at the edge of a long bay, is likely to have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nurho described the destruction as "great" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the debris of the buildings that collapsed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Norrow said that the number of deaths and damage could be larger along the north of Palo with a line 300 miles [190 km] across a beach, a region called Donglea, and closer to the area of the earthquake focus.
The media are completely broken and there's no information from Dongella, said Noroho.
"In the area, over 300,000 people live in the Red Cross by statement, and his men and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's now a tragedy, but things can get worse." He said.
On Saturday, a lot of criticism was given to the agency that he did not announce that he had been hit in Palo, even though official factors said that the waves had arrived while the warning was being published.
In the video on social media, you can see a man on a high roof of a building shouting hysterical warnings about the tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes of a wall of water crashing on the beach, carrying buildings and cars with it.
The Message Agency, Rogers, couldn't make sure that the photo was authentic.
Threats and threats have caused extensive power breaks that have cleared the communications around Palo and made it difficult for the authorities to match the rescue efforts.
The army began sending planes with assistance from Acarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but survivors still desperately need food and other essential necessities.
The city's airport only opens up for relief efforts and remains closed until October.
President Wiko and his uncle were scheduled to visit the rescue centers in Palo on Sunday.
From where the deaths in tsunamis in Indonesia were measured to over 800.
Things are very difficult.
While the people of the World Vision Dungella have arrived safely in the city of Palo, where shelter workers made up of a concrete set up in their office yards have passed through the scenes of destruction on their way, Mr. Dosva said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
Things are very difficult.
Even during the relief teams, they began to complain about the unfortunate actions of the enormity of the relief effort, which prevented them from reaching the presence of many experienced foreign aid workers.
According to Indonesia's regulations, funding, supplies, and people from other countries can only begin to be expelled if the affected area is known as a national disaster area.
This thing hasn't been done yet.
"It's still defined as a state-level disaster," said Olya Ariani, the representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can open the door to international assistance, but this situation has not been declared."
With the fall of the second night on Palo after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, friends and family of missing persons were arrested, hoping that their neighbors would be the miracles that would explain the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers rescued a woman who had been buried for two days, with her mother's body on her side.
Gendon Sovandono, the trainer of the Indonesia platoon team, trained two missing snubs for Asian games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others understand that caught in a hotel can see, including Mr. Mandgi, his disciples.
"The Ancient in the Field of Baths, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how the hours after the news of the collapse of a hotel saw an outbreak in the coastal community, he enthusiastically sent some messages from whatsApp to the competitions in Palo, which took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages showed only one gray sign, instead of a pair of blue marks.
"I think the meaning is that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Stealers were set off $26,750 during ATM handling at the Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning thieves robbed $26,750 of the Bricks' ATM operator at the Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver ran an ATM in the entertainment station and prepared to bring in more money, and researcher Dennis McCarte wrote the message.
While busy, another man ran behind the Bricks and stole a case with money to fill the ATM.

Any person who has information about their identity is required to contact the Newport police on the phone 859-292-3680.
KENYA WAST: Raffer changed his name to Ye
Harper Kanya and St change his name to Ye.
Speaking of the change in Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The wine that was known as Kenya West."
The 41-year-old West is well-known for a while, and he's been using the term like the eighth album, which came out of June.
The change comes first to his TV program, Satady Nate Live, where he's expected to launch his new album, Yanshi.
He's replacing the singer Ariane Granda who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons", so he said the plan was created.
In addition, it is a summary of his current professional name, and St said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think ya" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible the word is "you" and set said earlier this year, when he talked about the name of Albumom with the radio broadcast Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went through Kenya, which means the only one, just "You" -- just a reflection of the good that we have, the evil of our son, or the confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of some famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Kombes was informed of a replacement called Paff Daddy, Fi Daddy or Deedy, but the year declared that he preferred the names "love" and "brother love".
West's ex-partner, J.Z., he also moved between versions of his name with no envelopes and registrations.
The President of Mexico has pledged not to use the army against civilians.
The elected President of Mexico, Anders Manuel Lops Oberdor, has committed never to use military force against civilians, while the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
Lops Oberdor promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would never use the army to depress the Mexican people.
Army forces shot at a non-violence at the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people in a time when left-wing student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
Lops Oberdor has committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by providing financial support to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of opportunities urged young crime gangs.
The United States needs to double the funding of artificial intelligence.
With China's increased activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States needs to double the amount it engages in research in the field, so says the investigator working in the artificial field of cai-Puley, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His words come after various parts of the U.S. government have published statements about artificial intelligence, even when the U.S. government has no official artificial strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it's about to be number one artificially built by 2030.
"The double budget for research in artificial intelligence will be a good start, while all other countries are far behind the United States, and we're looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," he said to me.
The funding double could double the chances that the next great artificial understanding would be achieved in the United States, telling me to the CNBC network in the interview this week.
To me, the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published in the month following the release of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the executive director of the Synovation Ventures, who invested in China's most prominent artificial intelligence company: Facebook++.
In the 1980s, he worked on an artificial building system at the University of Krangy Malone, which had destroyed the first-classting player in the United States, and later served as senior manager at Microsoft Research and president of the Google Branch in China.
I've been familiar with the U.S. government's earlier technology competitions, such as the agency's robotics challenge for advanced research projects, and ask when you'll be next to help identify the next vision people.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, tell me.
"It's not China that you take us the leading investigators at the Academy, it's the business companies that do it," he told me.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited stars from universities in recent years to work in the artificial intelligence field.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think you should automatically offer Green Card to doctors in artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017 the State Council of China published its artificial development plan for the next generation.
The National Fund for Natural Sciences grants funding to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Fund for Science and other government organizations are the U.S. Bureau of Surveys, but the quality of academic work is lower in China than in China, according to me.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a joint artificial intelligence centre, which is to be used as a partner's evening from industry and the Academy, and the White House announced the establishment of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in artificial intelligence under the name AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in an artificial intelligence study.
Meanwhile, a U.S. law initiative designed to create a national security committee for artificial cooperation has not been operational for months.
The inhabitants of Macedonia point to a question with the question whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, citizens of Macedonia are asking whether to change her name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, a step that would solve a ten-year-old division with Greece that prevented her joining the European Union and the United States.
Greece, where there is a province called Macedonia, claims that her neighbor's name from North is in the context of a claim to the territory of Greece and the Teila and to the European Union for its accession to NATO and the European Union.
Both countries signed in June a deal based on the proposed new name, but against Americans, they claim that the change will damage the ethnic identity of the population of most of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he wouldn't vote for the people's question and the campaign of rebellion raised doubts as to whether the number of voters would stand at a minimum of 50 percent required to ask the people to be attacked.
The question in the ballot is, "Do you join NATO and the European Union with the receipt of an agreement with Greece?"
Whoever supports the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claims that it is a price worth paying to Macononia, which is one of the countries created by the deployment of Yugoslavia, you can join bodies like the European Union and NATO.
"I came today to point out the future of the country for young people in Macedonia so that they could live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safe life for all of us," said Oliver George at the age of 79 in scophaia.
Although the question of the people was not a legal obligation, enough members of Parliament said they would follow the voting results to make it a file.
To change the name would require a majority of two-thirds in Parliament.
The country's election committee said there were no proper irregularity at 13:00.
However, only 16% of voters were voting, compared to 34% in the last Parliament election in 2016, with 66% of the voting rights voting.
"I came to vote for my kids, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Josa Tanbsky, voting in the capital city of Scophia.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, and his son, Zorka, are running their ballot in Strasbourg, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, asking the people in Macedonia for a change in the name of the country, which will open the door to NATO and the European Union.
On the front of the Parliamentary House in Scophia, 54-year-old Vladimir Cauderkov made a small stage and pockets in front of the halls that set up those who were keeping the people's demands.
"We're for NATO and the European Union, but we want to join a sharp head, not through the server's entrance," said Cauderkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have respect.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zave said that NATO companies would bring the most necessary investments to Macedonia, with unemployment rates above 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour of more than 80% of our population being supported by the European Union and the NATO," said Zave after his vote.
He said that a positive result would be our security of the future.
A survey published on Monday by the Macedonia Policy Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the people's question - less than the required participation volume.
Another wish, which was held by the Macedonian TV network on TV, found that 57 of the respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
From their midst, 70% said they'd vote.
In order for the people to succeed, the voting rate should be at least 50 percent plus one.
The failure of the liability will be the first significant loss of the pro-West government policy since it took power in May last year.
Video: Manz'ster City player, Agororo's sword, driven through the whole Briyton defense to score a gate
Agororo and Sterling's men broke down Briyton's defense in the 2-0 victory of Manz'ster City on Saturday at the Lord's Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed like Guerro was wearing the gate with ease.
An Argentine resort was delivered in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Britton's defense players before breaking into the open field.
At this point Agoro found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one shield before he got a few more shields on the Bryton's broad border.
Then he kicked a left-hand pass, and found Sterling.
The English suit used his first contact on the whole to deliver the ball back to the Agoro, who hit the right foot, beat the gate of Bryton, Matthew Ryan, with a bullet to the right side of the net.
"Agwaro has problems with his feet," said Manz'ster City's director for reporters.
We agreed he'd play about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he took a gate at the moment."
But it was Sterling that gave the "Everlasts of Heaven" the advantage that I started with the super League.
This gate arrived in the 29th minute.
Agoro got the ball deep in Bryton's territory during this.
He sent a great crossball along the right wing to Leroy Sanana.
Sana set off the ball before he led Starling in the direction of the distance.
Sky blue player pushed the ball into the grid right before he jumped out the field.
Manz'ster City will face fashions in the game of the League of Gods on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Xin-Kakar stadium in Xinzia, Germany.
Squirrel wants to play Spoiler in front of the Rockies.
With the arrival of the nashonals from the playoff competition, there was no good reason to force another start.
But there's still implications for the playoff for the rock, leading one game on the L.A. Dodges at the NL West League.
The Roxies had at least set themselves up for an open ticket with the 5-2 win on the Nashionles on Friday night, but they never promised the first place at home.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the viewers and the second group will play the highest level probably at every point I'm going to handle this year.
Why wouldn't I want to handle this?"
The Nationals have not yet declared the starter for the first day, but according to the reports, they tend to let a hairdresser approach in such a situation.

Trump is under arrest in West Virginia.
President Reincidentally hinted at the situation around his elected Supreme Court candidate Bert Kwano, while he spoke of the importance that Republicans would be able to vote in the middle of the term.
"All we've done was put to the balance in November.
Five more weeks for the most important choices in our lives.
It's one of the worst, the worst-- I'm not running, but actually I'm running, and that's why I'm running everywhere and fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on and said, "You see this terrible, terrible group of extremists, you see it happening right now.
And if we are determined to take back the power by whatever means it takes, you see the evils, the blasphemous.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to dance to get power and control, that's what they want is power and control, we're not gonna give them that."
The Democrats are, according to him, on a mission "to resist and interfere."
"And you see it during the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "wrongs, evil, evil, arrogant and dishonest."
He mentioned in her name the leader of the underprivileged of the St.
Remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I waited until -- it was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a Florelist place.
She doesn't have to be patient with those who express their opinion.
When Momentum traffic activists in my local party branch voted to support me, it wasn't a big surprise.
After all, I'm the last member of Parliament to be told that they're not welcome -- and only because we've made our point.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated that way because she was firmly opposed to anti-semitism.
In my case, the decision to throw me away was to visit me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
Regarding the considerations of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, most of the EU, similar issues to those whose backs Grimy did not agree with former party leaders.
At the meeting of the East Nottingham Liver Party on Friday, it was said, "We want the meeting to be college and pedagogical."
For most of my eight years as a member of a local Parliament of the Labour Party, the General Committee's meetings on Friday night were just like this.
To the extent that many of the political meetings and promises of "more friendly, more gentle" have long been forgotten, even if they have ever started.
It turns out more and more that the Labour Party has no tolerance for different views, and every opinion has been judged as being acceptable to the party's leadership.
This situation began shortly after Rami was elected to the party's head, when colleagues who had previously thought that we shared a similar political view, began to expect him to make a plot and take the positions I would never agree with -- whether it was about national security or a single European market.
Every time I talk in public -- and it doesn't really matter what I say -- it's right now that the abuser of evidence in social networks with a call for rejection, the political defenses of the center and the calls I don't have to be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than I am, because the notes I have about me tend to be political.
I have become a victim of the professionalism and determination of the same colleagues who are faced every day in the face of a flood of racial abuse but never shrinking.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era is how levels of abuse have become a normal matter.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party had developed a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're already the same place as Florellist, and with any decision of "untrust" or a change in the entire selection, the party becomes more vulnerable.
Over the past two years, many people have advised me to keep my mouth shut, not be so cool, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, I've been shocked by the omission by the Government of the Tashhur government that has almost broken down my public school class, looking for how to fight for a better social service for those who need it most -- whether as a local councilman or a civil servant of the government.
I've never hidden my political opinions, including the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could in any way be confused about my political and controversial positions with the current leadership.
For those who made the decision on Friday, all I have to say is that while the country is crawling towards Braczyt that would harm the families, in our business and public ministry, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the year.
But the one message I have is, in fact, not for the movement of montaneum in Nottingham, but for my chosen public, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats or political benefits will make me aware of the way I believe that you serve the interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Mileros: Unscrew Air to the top
Two recent freshs have slightly reduced the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Air is worthy of winning the awesome and incredible game held today at the top of the Scottish League.
They're now at the top of the table, the only unsavory side of the 10th.
Eventually, it was their best defense, as well as taking the risks a lot more, that played for the benefit of the home team, and coach Peter Mord's had all the reasons to be happy.
"We've been testing our games so far, and we're still unsavory, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christy from the Melrose Group said, "Layer arrives at all the credit, they've given better chances than us."
Grant Anderson's 14th test, which was made known by Frasier Clemo, placed Air in the lead position, but a yellow card for a Scottish rory Hewes team player who was released to the game by Horios, enabled Melros to get points and Jason Bagot caught a fresh non-homar.
Clemo brought up Air's lead with a felony, right before he was half, and then Miri Tri Solo to get 17-5 to half.
But Melrose opened the second half well and the terry of Patrick Anderson, which was saved by Gutt, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a severe injury by Rodrit Knut, taken away in the Lonca, and starting with the game renewal, Air increased the gap through St.
Then, once again, a yellow card was used, and a yellow card was used again, another man with a non-brous-Colwin terry, ending a series of tremendous pressure.
But the house team recovered, and when St.
Clemo Meyer, as he did almost again from the back of the game, after Kyle Roy S.
Still Game Star seems ready for a new career in restaurants.
Still Game, Ford Krennon, looks ready to move to the restaurant branch after it was discovered that he was designated manager of a licensing restaurant company.
The 56-year-old player plays the role of Jack Jarvis in BBC's popular program, which he writes and where he rides along with his old partner to comedy, Greg the Fall.
The third announced that the next ninth season would be the final season of the show, and it seems that Karnan is planning the life after Crilling.
According to official records, he's the manager of Adriftmhorn Limited.
The player refused to respond to the story, despite the fact that the Scotch San Remez that Krenner was looking for ways to get into the thriving restaurant business in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours." Bolivia that there is no sea. Hope the Court opens a path for her to the Pacific.
Seafaring sailors at the Navy headquarters were partially evacuated by bal-fez ships.
Public buildings are blue-sealed flags.
Sea Bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazons bear the password: "The sea is ours according to the right.
It's our duty to sue him back."
In all parts of Bolivia where there is no sea, the memory of a beach line that has been lost in favor of bloodless conflict over resources in the 19th century is still alive -- as is the chemistry to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps in China for decades, while Bolivia is waiting for an international court decision on October 1, after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course he looks forward to having a positive attitude to the continents," said Roberto Clazilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are bound by the decision of the international court on large-scale agreements throughout the country, hoping that the Bahag court will decide in favour of Bolivia's demand for decades of wrong calls, an offer to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea for Bolivia.
Bolivia's official birthday president, Ooh Morals, who is faced with a controversial struggle to re-election next year, has made a lot of decision on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But philosophers think that there's no great chance that the court will be in the best interests of Bolivia and that even if it decides for its own good, it won't matter much.
The U.S. court that sits in Baag has no authority to give a territory of Chila, and indicated that it will not determine the results of possible conversations.
The fact that the entry of the International Court only came six weeks after the hearing of the agreed arguments indicates that the case was "uncomplicated", but Paez Zerata, a Chilean expert for international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's claims, even the last four years may have weakened them.
"The issue of sea access was kidnapped by the current government in Bolivia," said Zerata.
Morals' war history has eliminated any rest of the will of Chile, for its sake.
Sometime Bolivia and Chile will keep talking, but it'll be very difficult to have a discussion after that.
Both countries haven't changed between them since 1962.
The previous president, Eduardo Rodriguez and hers, a representative of Bolivia Baag, rejected the idea that the court's motion was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "a great opportunity to open up a new era in relation to Cheila" and the chance to end the 139 years of division for both sides," he said.
Klazadilla also denied that he was still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - is using the subject of the seas as a political leverage.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to access to the Pacific", he added.
"Stop is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear damage is not going to happen unless it can give confidence in the United States.
The North Korea Foreign Minister, Rie Young, said they'd never want to break up their nuclear weapons first if she couldn't trust in Washington.
We're talking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the U.S. to keep the promises given during the summit in Singapore among the leaders of the two rival states.
His words are coming as the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompo, appears to be on the verge of reopening the diplomatic contacts on nuclear weapons that reached a dead end more than three months after the summit in Singapore with the leader of North Korea, Kim Gong Un.
Ri said it was "a dream in Mesopotamia" to think that the United States' sanctions and resistance to declare the end of the Korean War would force North Korea to strike a knee.
The United States is afraid to agree to a declaration without North Korea first taking significant nuclear-weapon-free action.
They're Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, interested at the second top.
However, there is widespread doubt that North Korea is serious about the release of its nuclear weapons, where it is likely to see the only way to protect its security.
Pompo's planning to visit Pyongyang next month for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
A fashion display in Paris reveals the new trand with huge hats found on its way to the expensive stores everywhere.
We'll find the solution for anyone who wants to expand the hat collection or get total sun protection.
The designers and Tom Brown and Tom Brown discovered a row of massive and crazy head coverings for their SS19 college, in a fashion show that filled the style scene in Paris fashion week.
Non-fracratic hats carrying the summer Instagram, and these designers brought their extraordinary works to the fashion show course.
Valentino's bulla was an extra-colored hat with a slit in broad legs like feathers that covered the first of the models.
Other large-scale aliens included scaffolded birds, a magic hat and even an anesthetics -- but they were not meant to protect the head from the cold.
Tom Brown also revealed a selection of strange masks -- a time for Halloween.
Many of the coloring features included symphony, which was more decomposed to Hannibal Lecter than to hot cottore.
One piece mentioned a shaving mask, including nailes and glasses, and another looked like a copper ice cream cup.
And whoever wants to go on with a huge fashion statement - their time has come.
Fashion freaks watch the giant hills make their way to the fancy shops everywhere.
The giant hats are the next hit after Lala Bomba, the straw hat with a square metre quarter in diameter that is on everyone's head, from Mariana to Emily Ratakowski.
The calt behind the very unparate hat that surrounded the social networks is another big piece on the track - a seabag almost size size sized as this of the model of the swimsuit that carried it.
The pink-colored profile case, with a loose and white leather hand-yellow, was the feature of the SS19 collection of Glen La Rivera in Paris fashion week.
A stiltist known as Luke Arming said to FEMAIL: "I watch large hats and big seabags arrive at the expensive stores next summer -- because design has made a huge impression and it will be hard to ignore the biscuit to the sparse size."
John Edward: language skills essential to the citizens of the world
The Royal Schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, which was continued in 2018 with a further collection of outstanding test results, which received support from personal and group success in sports, art, music and other activities in the congregation.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Schools Board (SCIS), are setting up the best level of service for students and parents.
Independent schools are eager to prepare their students for further education, a career in which they will be selected and appointed as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector able to plan and develop a school program in a personal way, we find that modern languages continue to be popular as required in school.
Nelson Mandela said: "Speaking to a man in a language he understands, it gets into his head.
Speaking to a man in his language, it gets into his heart."
It's an important reminder that we can't rely only on English when we want to build ties and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of recent tests this year, languages are seen to be at the top of the tablets with the highest percentages of success in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have learned foreign languages have achieved a high A grade.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of the students achieved a higher A grade in Danish, 72 percent of those taught in German, 69 percent from those taught in French and 63 percent from those taught in Spanish.
These data show that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and teenagers will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, the language field of choice is considered to be the same level as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the courses of the independent schools and in other places.
A 2014 survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Council found that, among the reasons why employees mentioned Cody to fill out free jobs, 17 percent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, to a large extent, language skills become essential for future careers.
The need for languages for future employment opportunities, these skills are vital in a globalized world of globalization.
No matter what career a person will choose, if he learns a second language, he will have a significant advantage in the future because of the potential he has for the rest of his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries is automatically stable in a position of advantage over competitors.
According to a survey of YouGov that included over 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language at a level sufficient to have a conversation, and French was the only language where there was a double-counting number of speakers, 15%.
That's why it is important to invest in children’s languages today.
Knowledge of many languages, especially those of developing nations, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school would be different with regard to the languages it teaches.
Some schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will learn languages that are more thoughtful for Britain in a forward-looking view of the 20th century, such as Mandarian and Japanese.
Whatever the child's area of concern, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in the independent schools, with a team of teachers in the field.
The Royal Schools of Scotland are obliged to provide a school environment to prepare children and hunt them with skills needed to succeed, in any future.
Today, it is impossible to deny, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so this fact needs to be reflected in education.
Indeed, there is a need to see in modern languages "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, diversity and excellence to the children of Scotland.
It's an hour order.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools.
LeBron is expected to play for the first time in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The waiting was over for fans waiting to see LeBron James for the first time in the Los Angeles Lakers group.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James would play the open pre-season game in front of the Denver's board on Sunday in San Diego.
But before we decide a few minutes, he'll play.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," written on Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudel published a Twitter ad that probably James will play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers pre-season games.
"At this point in my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Trump's stop time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is opening up the window of tonight's election arrests in Willing, Virginia.
It's the first of five planned tramp stops this week, including stopovers in friendly places like Tansi and Mississippi.
While you voted for his appointment to the Supreme Court judge, Trump Schaff was about to build support for the upcoming mid-term election, as the Republicans were in danger of losing control in Congress after the vote in November.
What time does Trump's stop in West Virginia tonight and how can the Internet be watched?
Trump's in Welling, West Virginia, is scheduled to start at 19:00, according to the East Coast clock, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's stop in West Virginia on the Internet in a direct flow in YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will deal with the hearings that were held this week for the Supreme Court candidate Bert Kwano, who turned into an operation around the charges of sexual misconduct and, in the wake of this, a repudiation of the vote in St.
But the main purpose of this arresting effort is to help Republicans face the challenge election from November to achieve a little momentum.
The election of President Trump said that the target of five of these camps next week is "to encourage volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Saint and the House of Representatives", according to Roberts.
"The control of Congress is so critical to his organization, until the president is ready to visit as many countries as possible with the entrance to the surrounding election season," told Roiter that Trump's campaign was being launched, asking him to remain anonymous there.
Tonight's warehouse, which is scheduled to exist at Westbanko Stadium in Willing, can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract a press cover from the Wittsburg press, for the assessment of West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump is visiting West Virginia, the country where he won more than 40% in 2016.
Trump's trying to help the Republican candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisy, who's in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisy that the president has to come to try to improve his condition in the polls," said Simon Hyder, political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Roiter.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows right to fight to keep hope for my only games on Sunday.
After three single-tips, the fourth games on Sunday afternoon may be exactly what the Ryder Cup needs.
Momentum's driving sleigh is a completely available sports idea, but the players really believe in it, and never more than in competitions like this one.
So where do they think we're gonna find the momentum now?
"They had a six-point advantage, and now it's four, so you can see it's a bit of a mumantum," said Gørn at the end of a day.
Europe's in the lead, of course, four points ahead with 12 more in the game.
But the Americans, as I say at the end of the day, feel that they have a little wind in the bays, and they have a lot to encourage, not the last of them in the past form, and Stan Thomas, who played together all day and each of them has three points out of four.
He was deadly from T. to the green and he was a leader in a personal example.
The joys grew stronger as his turn went on, as he starved critical pats to win four all-square game and Thomas dropped two after two.
His party that won the 15on game won at a similar cry, the kind that he believes the American team still has hope.
"You really should just dig deep and just worry about your own game," said rest.
That's all that's left for each of these actors to do.
18 to leave a mark.
The only players with more outposts and Thomas over the last few days are Francisco Molinari and Tommy Peltywood, the leading story without the trigger of the Ryder Cup.
The strange, but charming, part of Europe is four out of four and wins to the unity of all.
"Mollywood" was the only one who didn't hit the bugey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and late Friday morning nine.
The same round, and the way that their energy appears to flow to and from the enthusiastic crowd, is based on the fact that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Pilate or Molinari to sign the potential European victory with the sun sinking on the Le golf National.
It's better both at the same time in different groups.
However, it's early to talk about European glory.
Bob and Watson Webb Simpson finished with Serge's Yo Gracie, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he robbed Alex Noren.
Booby and two times the front nine took the Spaniards down and the Swedishs to the hole they didn't get close to getting out of him.
However, Sunday there's no one to help you get out of the hole.
It's fascinating to look closely at the four balls and the four because of the interactions between the two sides, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way strategy can change your eyes.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has been significantly saved for the last day, but it has shown that the American team is filled with the spirit of a battle that has been fought, mostly within the United States, in which it has been questioned.
Europe leads 10-6 towards the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is in a healthy lead towards the last day of the Ryder Cup after completing the four-ball and four-four-day games on Saturday at 10-6 in front of the United States.
The full inspiration of Tommy Flintwood Vernsco Molinerry led the change with two winnings on the Nabbak tiger Woods, and raised the gap so far in the Le Golf National for four points.
Thomas Byron's European side players, who tried to protect the cup that he lost two years ago in Hezletin, ruled in front of the Americans who had chosen the four ball games this morning, and brought the show to 3.1.
The American players showed greater resistance to the four games, and they won two games, but they couldn't close the gap.
To continue holding the cup, G.E.E. Purik's friends need eight points from the 12 only games.
Peltywood is the first European troch, which won four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who won the "Mollywood" term after an extraordinary weekend, are just the second-point one that won four of their opening games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reid in the four-ball games, they continued with a remarkable harmony to defeat the weak Woods and the American routing Bryson Dachmbubow with an even more vague result of 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself over two games on a Saturday, showed random bursts of greatness, but so far he lost 19 out of 29 of the four and four ball games, and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who sat during this morning's four-ball games, came back to join Henry Stanson in the fourth games to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coopa, first and third in the world.
However, it wasn't all easy for European players to play in the cool weather and the cool wind that settled south-west of Paris.
Three times the winner was Jordan Sada and Stan Thomas offered the throne for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a two-and-one victory over John Ram Sperd and Ian Pulter in the four-ball games and later returned to beat Walter and Rory McLeroy 4 and 3 in the 4th Games, after losing the first two superheroes.
Only twice in the history of the group Ryder Cup came back from a four-point negative gap to the only games, though, as holding the cup, Purik's people just need to knock to keep holding the cup.
However, after standing in the other place for two days, an attack against Sunday seems to be beyond their reach.
North Korea says that, in no way. She won't break apart one-sided weapon without trust.
The North Korea Foreign Minister announced on Saturday that the sanctions continued to deepen her lack of confidence in the United States and that there is no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons in a unilateral manner under these circumstances.
R. Yung Ho announced at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken significant steps of good will last year, such as the cessation of nuclear missile experiments, the dismantling of the nuclear test site and the commitment not to develop any more nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see any consistent response from the United States," he said.
Without confidence in the United States, we can't be sure about our national defences and under such conditions, and we won't be single-handedly nuclear-weapon-free.
While she returned to North Korea's well-known complaints about the United States' objection to the North Korea nuclear-clearance approach, as North Korea has done in the past, his statement seems important.
He referred to a joint announcement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the top of history between the President of the Americas and the leader of North Koreans in Singapore on June 12, where Kim committed to act towards the "nuclear phase-out of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea requested an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States said that North Korea had to give up its nuclear weapons first.
The United States also objected to calling for a reduction in the international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "nuclear fission first" and increases the pressure of the sanctions to achieve its goal in the way of subjugation, and even resists "declaration of the end of the war," said R.
"The perception that sanctions can cause us to cry out is a dream in the ambiguity of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the fiercest sanctions deepen our lack of trust."
Ree didn't mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which was highlighted by the president of the United States at his U.S. address earlier in the week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea, Mon Jaya-Nuin in the last five months, adding: "If the second side of the issue of nuclear fission was South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear destruction of the half Korean island would not have reached such a dead end."
Even so, Rie's speech was dramatically different from last year's, so he told the U.S. General Assembly that North Korea's missile attack was inevitable after Mr. President Trump called Kim "Rocket Man" in the suicide mission.
The year in the U.S., Trump, last year threatened North Korea's complete destruction, praised Kim for his courage in making weapons-free steps, but said that there was still a lot more work to do and that sanctions had to remain in sight until North Korea's nuclear disposal.
On Wednesday, Trump said he doesn't have a fixed time frame for this, and added, "If it takes two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claimed that the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for steps taken.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompow told the U.S. Security Council on Thursday that "the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with firmness and not stop until we get a complete and real nuclear detonation."
The Security Council has supported one of the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block the funding of its ballistic and nuclear missile plans.
Pompo met with Ree on the side of the United Nations General Assembly and later said he'd be visiting Fungyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompo has been visiting three times this year in North Korea, but his last visit didn't come up nice.
He left A. Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but several hours later, North Korea rewarded him for setting the Gangster requirements.
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to break down a missile site and also a nuclear facility, if the United States were to set up a "corresponding steps".
He said Kim told him that the "corresponding steps" he wanted included security guarantees that he had committed in Singapore, as well as changes in the normalization of his relationship with Washington.
Students in Harvard are taking a course on how to rest enough.
A new course at Harvard University this year teaches participants how to sleep more, trying to struggle with the expanding culture of learning by staying up all night with caffeine.
An academic study found that students at one university often in the world have no idea of how to look after themselves.
Charles Kessler, professor of sleep sciences at Harvard School of Medicine and an expert at Brigham And Williams Hospital, planned the course, the first of which is from the United States.
He was inspired to open the course after the lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the talk, one girl came to me and said, "Why are you telling me this just now, in my last year of school?"
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleeping -- which surprised me, he told the telegraph.
The course, which was passed for the first time this year, explains to students the principles of how good sleep habits help the academic and athletic performances, as well as improving their overall situation.
Paul Breere, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and senior director of the University Health Services, said that the university decided to open the course after she found out that students had suffered from a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The course that lasts for an hour includes a series of interactive missions.
In one part, a picture of a room in the dormitory, where students press coffee cups, curtains, sports clothes and books - to get explanations of the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performances are influenced by a lack of sleep, as well as the importance of walking to sleep.
In other words, it is written to participants how persistent sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a campus map, if interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know it won't change students' behavior overnight.
But we think they have the right to know -- just like you have the right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, add Professor Ceysler.
According to him, pride over the sleepless night shift still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students cause the problem of sleep deprivation to grow.
Sleep concern is sufficient, and for good sleep quality, every student's secret weapon must be to fight stress, stress and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation can lead the brain to hunger, so we're hungry all the time.
Raymond Sue, a 19-year-old student in California who was studying chemical and physics, helped Professor Kessler design the course, after attending one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course lit his eyes and moved him to encourage a course for the whole campus.
The next step, so he hopes, will require all students to describe progress towards completing a similar instruction program before joining the competition institution.
Professor Cecil recommended that students check out a clock that would ring when the time came to go to bed, not just for the time when it should wake up, and be cities for the harmful effects of blue light that electronics agree and the LED theory, which could break the sterilistic rate and cause problems with ageing.
Livingston 1-0 Rang's: the gate of Manga is forced into Jared's players.
Hern's suffered another attack of losing a game except when Dolly Manga caused Stephen Jared's rebel players to defeat 1-0 in Livingstone.
Ibroks' players have been hoping to win their first win in the game except since the victory on February 1-4 in St.
Manga attacked seven minutes before the middle, and it didn't seem to be the renegade players from the lack of inspiration.
While Rang's running for the sixth place, Livingston's climbing third place and immediately after the Hibernian at the gate.
And possibly waiting for another Rang's Debal after the Kalum Spence line needed to be treated for head injury after an object was probably thrown away from the offer.
Gerard valued eight exchanges in the group that passed over Air to the half-finals in a cup in Tafred.
Holt, on the other hand, went up with the 11 Livingstone players who left Harts last week, and he could have been seven of the ways in which the players swallowed up the rivals in any situation.
Rang's may have controlled the holding of the ball, but Livingstone did more with the ball he had in their hands.
They almost spent a second minute sending a ball to Scott Patman to the gate of Alan McGurger, but the midfield player kicked the ball too far.
After that, Kegan Jacob found Captain Craig Alcat, but his shielder Alan to Guy could only kick out of the hole.
Rang's got control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last three.
Alfredo Morlos certainly thought that he had to make a mistake after a quarter of a game, when he and Steven Williams got into trouble, but Judge Stephen T.
The rang's been able to kick only twice to the gate in the first half but the Ibrox gate Liam Belle easily touched Sana Colubali and the weak kick of Obi Ajaria.
While the opening of Livingstone's 34 minutes was contrary to how the game was conducted, no one would deny that they deserved at least their hard work.
Rang's failed again in dealing with a deep-sea jakobs ball.
Scott Artfield didn't react while Declan Gelger passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who was watching for a cold wind in moving to Manga to a simple ending.
Gerard did a half-time job when he replaced Colibly with Ryan Kent, and the exchange had an immediate effect almost when the extreme/nose ball to Morlos but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block it.
But Livingstone continued to force the guest group to play exactly the kind of game he liked, when Laigh and the hit keep sending long pills.
Holt's group could increase the flow in the other stages, but McGargore is well-established to prevent a attempt by Jacobs before a corner was removed from the corner.
The Reneg's replacement player Glenn Middleton had another claim for a felony against Jacobs, but Thompson was ignored again.
Your right: Procrastinator Mona Jaeger
And now stand up for Sunday Morning on September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and continue... the day when the physicist for the future of Johns Willem was born in Germany.
Geir developed a method that allows for identification and detection of radioactives, which eventually led to a device known as Mona Geger.
Since 1950, the device has become an integral part of science, but in 1950 it has also become an integral part of pop culture because of the film "Bells of Coronado", where Roy Roger's and Dale Evans have turned into two strange mornings/scientifics:
Man, "What the hell is this thing?"
This is Mona Geger, which is used to trace radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put the headphones together, you can really hear the effects of radioactiveity on the atoms in the minerals."
Evans: "Oh, my God, it's really bombed right now!"
Hans Geeger went to world in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live after him.
A new vaccine for cancer can teach the immune system to see cancer cells.
A new vaccine for cancer can teach the immune system to see and eliminate cancer cells.
A vaccine teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells as part of treatment
The method includes the recovery of immune cells from the patient, and the change of cells in the lab
Then cells can "see" a protein that shares many cancers, and then they're weird back to the patient.
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
For one patient, who teaches the immune system to detect cancers, cancer of the lungs has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes patient recovery of immune cells, laboratory cell changes so that they can "see" a protein called HER2 which is associated with many cancers, and then the injection of cells back into the patient.
Professor J. Brzosky, from the U.S. National Institute of Cancer in Batsada, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "incentives the development of a number of cancers", including breast cancer, cancers, lung, and bowels, explained a prop' Brzospasti.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "Teaching" them how to attack cancer cells has managed to treat a type of blood cancer.
Kenya West broke up in a statement in support of the Trump, when his head had a MAGA hat, after being displayed in the SNL.
It wasn't in a beautiful eye.
Kenya West responded to Boys' call at the studio during a confusing show at the Street Nate Live show, praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he'd run for Presidentship in 2020.
After performing his third song on the program, called "Gost Town", when he carried out the Mace America Great hat, he broke into a protest speech against the Democrats and returned to his support in the Trump.
"So many times I talk to white people who say, "How can you love Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd be leaving America a long time ago, he said.
SNL's chapter began with an evaluation in the form of Matt Damon, where the Hollywood planet honored Bert Kwano's testimony to the Senate's Legal Committee, in relation to the charges of sexual assault brought up by Christine Blazzy Ford.
Although the protest speech wasn't broadcast on the show, it was put on social networks by Communist Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to roll over West in advertising this thing.
In addition, West complained to the crowd that he had followed a review behind the scenes on the hat he wore.
They attacked me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go to the stage with this hat on your head."
They attacked me!
And then they said I was in a dark place," he said, according to the Washington Express.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the dark place?" saying he's wearing my Superman hat, because that means no one can tell me what to do.
Try to show love."
His words were given at least twice by the crowd, and it seemed that SNL team members were embarrassed, reporting Variethy, and one of them said to the newspaper, "The peace of my mother is in the entire studio."
West is involved in the program as a replacement at the last minute's place of singer Ariane Granda, whose former partner, Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West Ham many when he performed the song I love it when he was dressed as a danger bottle.
West won support from the leader of the TTPUSA, Kends Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the most brave souls: thank you for not surrendering to the crowd."
But the application of the Athealia Hunter Foundation program was written by Twitter West, "Be who he is, and it's absolutely wonderful."
But I chose not to be rewarded (by acquiring the music or by bartering it or by supporting its art) that I think is an effort and an Ediology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we. She's added.
Before the plan, Harper announced that he had changed his name, and said that now he's the one who's been known as Kenya West.
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Deedy, also known as Paph Deedi, Papi and P-Dadi.
Another rapper, Snup Doc, has been called Snuff Lyon, and, of course, the known musician Prince changed his name to the symbol and then to an artist who used to be known in the Farrins.
A charge for attempted murder following a stabbing at a restaurant in Blapsette
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at the restaurant in East Belft on Friday.
According to the police, the incident was an incident in the occupied Belgium.
The unsub is expected to appear before Blapsette's court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecution Service.
The chain star the throne games, Keith Harington, attack the toxic masculinity
Kit Rinton is known for the role of John Snow from the Smurf of the violent naval fantasy series of crown games.
But the 31-year-old player attacked the superhero stroop, saying that these jobs on the screen often convey to young children the message they have to be tough to respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Keith, who recently married another star in the throne games, Rose Leslie, who was 31, admitted to being very troubled about dealing with this issue.
"Someone I feel very upset right now -- where we were wrong about masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men in their growing years, from the point of view of the problem we're witnessing to now?"
Keith thinks that TV may be partly responsible for a poisonous masculinity, because of its very male character.
He continued: “What comes from inside and what do we learn from the outside?
What do we learn from TV, and on the street, that makes young children feel they must be on this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the biggest questions of our time -- how do you change it?
'Cause there's no doubt something went wrong for young men."
In an interview, he admitted that he would not participate in any series or series of crown games after the end of the series next summer, saying that he was "finished with combat fields and horses".
Starting in November, Keith was going to be re-adjusting Sam Sheppard's real West play, who told the story of a movie producer and his bandit brother.
The player recently found out that he saw that he met his wife, Rose, as the best thing that happened as a result of the throne games.
"I knew my wife in a fine manner, so this way she gave me my future family, and my life from that moment on," he said.
Rose played the role of Yigrit, a member of John Snow's love, in the Fantasia winning the Amy Prize.
The two of us got married in June 2018 at the Lasley family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% rise in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in a number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are sick, so they have been given official health benefits.
About 40,000 new cases reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been infected by the existence of sex, which is a change against the past.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced almost zero, according to official health authorities in China at the Yunan district conference.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China rose to 100,000.
HIV infections resulting from the existence of sexual relations are a problem burning in the Chinese LHC.
Homosexuality was no longer against the law in China in 1997, but it is said that the strike against the U.S. people is widespread.
Because of the state's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of infection are the result of misuse of protective devices that are sufficient in these sex relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has guaranteed universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters asserts that a man from her team leaked information about a republican senator and protected the dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
American Senator Maxine Waters dismissed the charges that a member of her team published personal information about three American senators on the Victoria pages of the senators.
The Democratic Senator from L.A. has assessed the claims made by Internet sites and visitors to extreme right-hands.
"False, lies, and other disgusting lies," Waters announced in Twitter.
According to the reports, the information that included residence addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both of them from Mouth.
The information was posted on the Internet on Thursday, and published by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during a hearing before the Senate committee on allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct against the Supreme Court judge, Bert Kwano.
The leak took place some time after the three senators asked Quano.
It was reported that the IP address that identified the source of the publications was linked to Waters' office and published the information about a member of Waters' team, according to the report of the Hill.
"This baseless accusation is totally wrong and a complete lie", added Waters.
"My teammate -- whose identity and personal characteristics have been revealed and our security has been damaged as a result of these false and false accusations -- was not in any way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless accusation is totally wrong and a complete lie."
Waters announced an Internet review, including the former White House Press Secretary Ari Flysher.
"This is the denial angry," wrote Flysher.
"It shows that she doesn't have the temper required by congressmen.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he can't react to anger.
He's not allowed to respond to the erosion.
He can't doubt the motives of the accused.
He has to be calm and calm."
It seemed that Felisher was comparing Waters ’ reaction to a review of the Democrats by Judge Kwano, who was accused of being too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Ummar Nowaro, a Republican candidate trying to beat Waters in the middle of the priesthood, also raised his thoughts on Twitter.
Big if it's the truth, he wrote in Twitter.
In her announcement, Waters said that the surviver turned to the appropriate authorities and to the law enforcement of these false claims.
"We will make sure that the terrorists will be found," she said, "and they will be judged for all their destructive and dangerous actions against my team members."
A review of the film "Johnny English 3.0'" -- a tired spy record in the form of Rowan Atkinson.
It is now acceptable to look for meanings about the Berkezite in any new film with a British perspective, and it does seem to fit this re-surrection of the action-commediate predément of the Johnny Inglei-Inglesh process, which started out there in 2003 with Johnny English and woke up again in 2011 with Johnny Inglesh.
Is it ironic self-stirring how much we are worth going to turn into our country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the melodious Guoney Inglesy has been given another chance to spoil things -- and his name represents more than any other large-scale satellite production designed to watch films in countries that do not speak English.
He's, of course, the stupid English agent, who, despite his strange position to shine a particle, looks a little like a chlozo, a little mer-and-a-fever from this guy who donated a single teat to fire trucks in the opening text of the Olympics in London in 2012.
He's also originally based on the mysterious international passenger who discovered Atkinson in the forgotten television ads for the Barclaycard, named chaos behind him.
There's one minute or two nice in the last edition of Johnny English.
I liked the thing that Johnny Inglesh was approaching a helicopter when he was wearing a pair of middle-time armored clothes, and my pushing heart rang on his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson exhibits his local physical abilities, but humor feels rather weak and even more strangely, especially since the "greed" type of tapes like 007 and an impossible task for themselves now includes a local component.
Homer feels like he's turning to the kids instead of the adults, and for me, the crazy adventures of Gony English are less brilliant and focused on the jokes of Atkinson's violent film in Mr. Ben's character.
The film plot begins when a major danger threatens Britain.
A computer hacker opened a room for the British super secret Internet and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the chief agent's anxiety -- a small role, unfortunately, for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for a proud and war-ridden Prime Minister, who is already suffering from a total breakdown of political popularity: Emma Thompson does her best to play the role of Teresa May, but has little with what to do with the script.
Her intelligence counselors inform her that since every active spy is exposed, she'll have to bring someone back from retirement.
And it says "Ni Inglesh Herbbani on her own, is now employed as a school manager in a prestigious institution, but gives unofficial lessons in how to be a undercover spy: some good jokes here, when the English suggest an Academy for School Rocing.
Inglesh is brought back to Vietnam for an emergency briefing and is reunited with his former assistant for the suffering of Buff, which is again performed by Ben Miller.
Buff is now a married man to a chain commander, acting as an annoying class queen with a little wasted Vico Fredrin.
So Bettman and Robin of Her Majesty's secret service to a terrible complex are returning to action, with a beautiful Pam-Pattel in an Olympic character turning it into an Olga Coralenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling under the magic of a billionaire Krysmatic technology claiming that he can solve Britain's computer problems -- Jason Walta, the evil age of Jake Lacey.
Inglesh and Buff begin their accessa that is more than a pair of two clowns: in the shade of waiters, they rise up in the fire of a famous French restaurant; they create an Andremosia when they run themselves in the magnificent yacht of Volta; and angleis complete anarchy in our attempt to use a similar reality to learn the inner structure of Walta's home.
There is no doubt that all efforts are made to lead to the final sequence, but despite affections and affections, it has a sense of child TV.
A rather moderate level.
Like the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help but think: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice with his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it's preparing a program for the British to work four days a week but get paid for five days
The Jeremy Corbin Labour Party takes into account a Protestant plan of the British to work four days a week -- but they'll get paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants company managers to pass the savings as a result of the artificial perception (AI) to employees in another form of a day of rest.
I mean, the employees will have a three-day weekend, and they'll still get the same salary.
Sources said that the idea was to adapt to the company's economic organization and its plans to adjust the country to the interests of the workers.
The Congress of Professional Associations supports the transition to a four-day work week as a way for workers to enjoy economic changes.
A senior member of the Labour Party said to Sandy Times: "In terms of policy, it is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but it's a four-day work week where it fits in the party's attitude to the economy's re-escalation for workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Liver Party will not be the first to support such a concept, the Green Party called a week of four-day work during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, the ambition is not supported right now by the Labour Party as a whole.
"A four-day work week is not a party's policy, and the party doesn't consider it."
The pool candidate, John McDonnell, used the party conference last week to put his vision forward for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to recapture power from "unfaced managers" and "costing companies".
From the plans of the prospector, it is also suggested that potential shareholders and shareholders in water companies will not receive their full investment as the Labour government may make less on the basis of the discovery of improper conduct.
It also confirms that there are plans to add workers to the board of directors of companies and to create college-owned radiation to transfer 10 per cent of the private sector companies, which will be placed in a two-year DVD magic of up to $500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy told the TV show 60 minutes if the FBI's investigation of Quano would change their mind.
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Bert Kwano delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court at least a week, raising the question whether the investigators could convince any of the Republicans to withdraw his support.
In the idea of having a 60-minute program on Sunday, author Scott Fly asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their mind.
It seemed that Canadian was more open than his party colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I told the hearing, I said I was talking to Judge Kwano.
I called him after it happened, the charge went up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, determined, single."
On the other hand, Graham's vote seems to be in need of rock.
"I've already decided about Bert Kwano, and there's gonna be a need for a gross accusation," he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it.
"and no one she mentioned could prove it.
36-year-old thing.
I can't see how anything can change."
What's the world's civil festival, and did he give anything to reduce poverty?
Saturday New York features the World's Citizens' Festival, an annual music event with a most impressive list of stars that will appear and an impressive target of no less than an end to poverty in the world.
The State of the World's Citizens, which exists this seventh time, will bring to him tens of thousands of people who have passed away in Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as G'ant Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to increase the announcements to the true purpose of the event -- putting an end to extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which began in 2012, is the continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to bring an end to poverty by raising the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (but if they are willing to pay for the VIP card), on the island of the concert to complete a series of missions, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending e-mails to a world leader, calling or other significant ways to help increase the announcements for an end to poverty.
But how successful has the festival really been, when only 12 years before it came to fulfill its purpose?
Is the idea of giving a free ticket to a concert for people really a way to convince them to call for action, or is it another case of licitivism -- people who feel like they're really affecting by signing an extensive Internet or sending a billboard?
Since 2011, the World Civil Organization has reported over 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing a variety of goals.
These actions have helped the world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group recorded 390 commitments and declarations as a result of its operations, at least $10 billion of which had already begun to distribute or raise funds.
The group appreciates that funds have so far been a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partner of investors and man-made thirsters "to help children grow to their potential", and promise Rwanda $35 million to help put an end to nutrition in the country, after receiving over 4,700 Twitter supplies from "the citizens of the world".
"With support from the British government, donors, national governments and "world citizens" as you can, we can become social justice on the subject of undernourishment in history", said The Power of Nutrition Tracy Olman to the audience during the New London live concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions called on Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the pace of the project, Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children with dietary intervention.
In response to one of the common questions on their website that you asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The citizens of the world have responded: "It will be a long and difficult course - sometimes falling down and failing.
But, like the great movements ahead of us of civil rights and opposition to Eternheid, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B and Jannell Mona are among some of the events that took place at New York City's annual event, serving as the li-forns and yo-jacman bees.
The U.S. can use the Navy to keep the Russian energy export under control.
Washington can use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, discovering the U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zink, as noted in Washington Examiner.
Zink claimed that Russian engagement in Syria -- which is important to mention, at the invitation of the legitimate government -- was a race to spread to new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to enter energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said, according to the report.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States is able, with our fleet, to make sure that the seas are open and at the time of the need to launch a siege to ensure that their energy sources do not reach the market" he said.
Zinky turned his attention to an event that allowed Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defined itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to speak and compare Washington's attitudes to dealing with Russia and Iran, indicating that they were indeed identical.
"The economic possibility for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the flow and exchange of fuels", he said, referring to Russia as "one trick pie" because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come when Trump's government is on mission to increase its natural gas export to Europe, replacing Russian energy sources, which are a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this reason, Trump's government officials, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to cancel its participation in the "undeserved" pipeline project, which, according to Trump's words, turned Berlin into Moscow's "savory".
Moscow has often stressed that the Norrd Stars 2 pipeline project, worth 11 billion dollars and that it should double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion MCR, is only a financial project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's final resistance to a banned project is only for financial reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we are partners in the view that energy cannot be a pressure trigger and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said Russian Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting in Moscow with the U.S. Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, in September.
The U.S. position has been rewarded by Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industry Organization (BDI), the leading organization in the German industry sector, called on the United States to keep away from the energy policy of the European Union and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kampf, head of the German Industry Organization (BDI) following a recent meeting between the Consul of Germany and the President of Russia and Vladimir Putin of Germany.
Elizabeth Warren, seriously consider running for president in the year 2020, said Senator Metzche West.
The Senator from Massachusetts and Sts Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she "consider seriously" the possibility of running for the president after the mid-dependence election.
Warren confirmed his intention to run for the president during a meeting in the City of Hollyok in Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to arrive in Washington to fix our broken government, and that's why a woman needs to stand in the head," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider the race for president."
Warren expressed her opinion on President Donald Trump during the City meeting, saying that he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
I'm worried until my bones are robbed of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, she said.
Warren visited Trump on his appointment as Supreme Court judge.
In a drawing published on day and day, Warren said, "Of course we need the FBI's investigation before the vote."
However, a poll published on Sunday showed that most of Warren's choices do not think that she should run for the 2020 elections.
Eighty-eight percent of the voters in the Sachs and Satts said that the Senator should not run for election, according to a survey by the Center for Political Research of the University of Sappok and the newspaper âboston Golob.
Thirty-two percent supported tackling the Senator's presidents.
The survey showed that there was much more support for the run by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% supporting his chances of running against 48% opposed.
Stable characters from the fat Democratic Party in relation to possible challenges to the 2020 elections include former vice-president G'u Biden and Senator Mormont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make a formal decision in January, according to AFP reports.
Sarah Filyn describes the post-traumatic stress disorder of Traak Phylin at Donald Trump's arrest.
The 26-year-old Trak Pylin lived in Iraq for a year after his recruitment to the army in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on a day at night.
"What's going on with my son since he's been back allows me to identify with families who have seen the consequences of the PTSD disorder and some of the injuries that our soldiers are returning," she told the audience that they were in custody for Donald Trump in Tola, Oklahoma.
Phyline described his arrest as "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other released soldiers, "they return a little bit different, they return stiff, they come back wondering if what we gave their country's military and airmen, and all the other military men, are respected."
He was arrested on a day in the Wessilla city of Alaska, accused of assault and domestic violence against a woman, corruption of the family violence case and possession of weapons under rent, according to Dan Bennet, a WSPD spokesman.
18 countries and the Columbia District support reading the challenge on the new state shelter policy
Eighteen countries and the province of Colombia support the reading of a legal challenge to the new US policy that refuses to grant shelter to victims of situations where gang violence or family violence is involved.
Representatives from the 18 countries and the district of Milan will state the court's hand on a day and "in Washington to support the challenge reading on the asylum seekers' policy, according to the NBC report.
The full name of the complainant for the Grace v. Schens case, which was filed by the U.S. Civil Rights Union in August, is not exposed.
She said that her partner, his violent sons, had been abused by her, but official U.S. government officials rejected her request for shelter on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace's state attorneys have described countries to Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which provide a number of requests for a state shelter in the United States, as nations dealing with many problems in all matters of gangs and family violence.
The new U.S. state-of-the-art asylum policy abolished a BIA Council decision from 2014 on the migration issues that allowed refugees without certificates to flee from situations of family violence to apply for a public asylum.
The Attorney General of Columbia, Carl Resin, stated in a statement on the day that the new policy ignores tens of years of state, federal and international laws.
"Federal law requires that all discussions on requests for a state shelter be based on the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and that the new policy ban violates this principle", states the statement "Court friend".
The lawyers also claimed that policy, preventing the entry of immigrants, harming the economy of the United States, because they tend to become entrepreneurs and provide "needed work" to them.
Attorney General Jeff Schens ordered immigration judges not to grant more than a State shelter to victims who escaped from family abuse and gang violence in June.
"The state shelter is open to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear of racial, religious, national or social evils in a specific social group or political opinion", said Schens, a statement on the policy of June 11th.
The purpose of the state shelter would never have been to ease all the problems -- not even all the shitty problems -- in front of which people are standing every day around the world.
A desperate rescue effort in Palo, while the death row is doubled, in a race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become harder than a moment.
"There's a very tense feeling," said Rosa Cosoma, 35 years old. And if the baby's squeezing from the heat in the center of the pheasy in Palo, the ruined city.
"At every moment the ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is rare."
The inhabitants appeared to return to their destroyed homes, interlocking water-sparing objects, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of wounded people and hospitals, displaced from the earthquake at 7.5, were flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Dewey Harris, who suffered fractures in the back and shoulder, sat outside Palo's military hospital, where they were treated for severe convulsions that occurred after the earthquake.
The tears filled his eyes when he told how he felt the terrible earthquake struck the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he had shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the wreckage of the wall, I think, said Harris to the CIA, and added that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
“ I heard my wife crying for help, and then she kept silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're in a safe place."
The U.S. Ambassador blames China for "Brides" with propaganda adverts.
A week after a four-year-old official newspaper published a four-year-old advert in American Union, while promoting the advantages of trading between the United States and China, the U.S. Ambassador of China accused Big'ing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump, on his last day on the charge of the Chinese newspaper "Iina Daily", in De Moyen Reg'ister -- the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa -- after accusing China of attempting to intervene in the election to the American Congress on 6 November, she claimed that China had rejected it.
China's Trump's guilt tried to interfere with the U.S. election, marking a new stage, according to the words of official sources of the U.S., on the D.C. peace campaign aimed at activating pressure on China.
Although natural foreign governments will be aware of the promotion of trade, Beijing and Washington are now stuck in the Gua trade war, where every country rises up and compares its customs lessons on the products that have been exported.
The customs forces, which China raised as a reward at the early stage of the trade war, were intended to harm civilians from countries such as Eva, who supported Trump's Republican Party, said American and Chinese experts.
Terry Branstad, former governor of Iowa in China for many years, and an important export of agricultural goods to China, said that Big'ing had hurt employees, farmers and American businesses.
China, an article published in the A edition of the De Moane Register, “contains the acts of bullying by publishing awareness in our free press”.
In its campaign of propaganda, the Chinese government uses America's tradition of freedom of speech and precious press, and the announcement of an ad hoc payment in the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.
"Contrary, on the newspaper stand in Beijing, you will find a voice of hostile resistance and you will not see any real reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have on the disturbing economic course, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's leading newspapers avoided the offer to publish," although he did not mention a newspaper.
The Republican Party is moving women's voices away before the mid-dependence election with the Kwano incident, anthrax warning.
While many of the Republican party leaders stand by the Supreme Court candidate Bert Kwano and defend him against a number of charges of sexual assault, analysts warned that they would see a response against, especially women, during the next mid-dependence election.
Feelings around the matter were especially alive, and most Republicans officially demonstrate their desire to move forward with the voting process.
"You can't return this kind of thing," said Grant Reeve, a professor of State at the School of Execution of the University of Cyprus in The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Rear said he was questioning that the recent efforts of Senator G.F. Plick (the Republican Party of Arizona) to open up the FBI's investigation would suffice for Alice to vote angry.
"Women are not about to forget what happened yesterday -- they're not going to forget it tomorrow, not November," said the day and "Carrin Z'an-Pierre, a national senior and senior consultant of the MoveOne, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper. "
In the morning, and in the morning, the protestors called out "Noverber's Coming" when we showed up in the Senate hall, while the Republicans ruling at the Senate's trial committee chose to continue the promotion of Kwano's appointment, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, according to a report by the Mic website.
"The levels of motivation and motivation of democracy will be linked to new features" told the news site Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
People say they were already high; they're right.
But they can be higher, especially in the midst of female audiences and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, despite their lack of appreciation for the president, are often prevented from voting.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which dismissed her charges of sexual assault by the high court candidate, the analysts claimed that there would be a response against whether the Republicans would continue to promote appointment.
The appointment caused the Republicans to be seriously complicated, said Michael Steele, the former president of the National Republic Committee, at the beginning of last week, reported the NBC news channel.
"It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote or if Kwano receives the appointment, but also how the Republicans dealt with it and how they acted towards it," noted the news channel G. Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that assists in the election of Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat confused about the extent of their faith in Ford and Kwano's testimony, with slightly higher support in Ford.
A recent survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents certainly or most likely believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed in him for sure or most likely for our own sake.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that his condition was certain or probably during his testimony, while only 30 percent said it about Ford.
After Plake's pressure, the FBI now investigates the charges raised by Ford and the charges made by at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian newspaper's reports.
Ford gave a weekly witness to the Senate's Legal Committee last week that Kwano attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate revealed his identity to her during a party that attended their studies at Yale University in the '80s.
The Creator of the world's global network is planning to start a new web network to bridge Google and Facebook.
Tim Bernards-Li, the world's world-class web creator, the Start-up Society's launcher to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of the man who became a legend in the world of technology, is a company that develops Solid, the open code platform of Bernards-Li.
Solid platform allows its users to choose where to store their data and who are the people who have inherited to access the different types of data.
In an exclusive interview to Fast Company, Bernards Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was "control in the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the Start-up.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to create an online personal database or POD.
The challenger can include contact lists, performance lists, timetables, music library and other personal and professional tools.
Imagine that Google Drive, Microsoft Autaluk, Salac, and Septepai will be available in one of the most timely disciplines.
What distinguishes the personal database is that the user only decides who can access the information and what kind of information can be accessed.
The company calls it "personal power through data".
According to John Bruce, executive of the company, it means that, inrupt, you will find the right resources, processes, and abilities to assist in reaching out to everyone.
Today, the company includes Bernards Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting in the week, technology developers from around the world can create visited apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Bernard Lee said that he and his team are not discussing with Facebook and Google their agreement or their refusal to make a complete change, which will result in a complete and night change in all their business models.
"We're not asking them for permission."
In a post published in Medium on Saturday, Bernards Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission "is to provide commercial energy and an environmental system to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid".
In 1994, Bernards-Li changed the Internet face when he created the network's installation, W3C at the States Technology Institute.
Over the past few months, Bernards Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Also during the launch of Inrupt, Bernards Lee will continue to serve as founder and manager of the W3C, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm particularly optimistic about the next day of the network," added Bernard Lee.
Bernard Van: an event for a religious man who won the cross of Victoria during World War I
The only religious man from the English Church who won, as a force, the cross of Victoria during World War I was assigned to an event in his hometown, 100 years after winning.
Vice-President Bernard Vane won the Victoria Cross on September 29, 1918 on his involvement in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehakourt.
However, he was killed by a scarf four days later and never knew that he had won the highest British honors.
The stone of victory was revealed by his two grandsons, in a race held in Eden, in North Hampton County, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vane, said that the stone exposure was exactly 100 after his grandfather won the honors of "extraordinary."
According to the London newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Vice-President Wan led his regiment and crossed the San-Kenten Channel, "the way of heavy fog and heavy fire from field guns and showers".
Then he rushed to the line of fire and the "greatest bravery" led the line forward before we rushed to take one hand over the underside and dropped three out of the company.
Vice-President Wan was killed by a German scarf on October 4, 1918, one month before the war ended.
Michael Vane, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never compare to, but something that inspires me to be humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also left a stranger after the march, which led to the Brentwood Royal Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he was "highly respected for taking part in the march" and added that "the greatness of a real hero is reflected in the support given to many people".
The cross-war artists stayed up all night to watch the 206, where they got Pepe Pigg.
Imagine that you've been up all night watching Baltor 206 and finally watching a major event have been neglected by you.
The program involves a total of 13 battles, including six on the main card, and a live show on the night of the British 5 channel.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Jarard Mussi and Rory MacDonald were ready for battle, British viewers remained shocked when the survey changed to Pa Pigg.
Some of them were not impressed by the change when they remained awake until the early morning hours especially to watch the battle.
One fan described in Twitter the transition to child film as a kind of sick joke.
"It's a government procurement that says that at 6:00 a.m., the original content was not appropriate, so they had to go through the children's plans," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications in Blator, asking about the broadcast.
"Phip Pigg, yes."
President of the Blator Company, Scott Coker, said they were going to work on their schedule to include the British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the retransmission, I think we can probably solve it," said Coker.
But it's six o'clock in the morning and we can't solve the problem until day one in our time zone, which means day in their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe that during the transition, many text messages were exchanged between the parties and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it. We thought it was a technical problem.
But no, it was a government problem.
I can assure you that next time it's not going to happen.
We're only cleaning up five battles in six places -- as we usually do -- we tried to give the fans more and we've just overstretched.
It's a matter of unlucky."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt his sexual tendency
Tom Daily, the Olympic jumper in the water, said that during his adolescence he felt inferior to all others because of his sexual orientation -- but that feeling gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old jumper said he didn't know until he got to the middle class that "not everyone like me."
In an interview given in the Desert Island Discs program of Radio channel 4, under the guidance of Laurent Laurent Laurent, he said that the expression on homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also said that the turnout caused him to worry less about winning the Olympic games.
The usual extension of the old plan, Christy Young, was on a several-month sick leave.
In his appearance as Laurent's first plan star, Daley said that he felt the other "deposit" when he grew up that "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls".
He said, "To date, you've felt inferior, and the different feeling, there were real things that gave me power and power and enabled me to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so not to disappoint everyone when they finally found out what his sexual orientation was.
The man who twice won the Olympic Herald medal became the lead driver of the U.S. Community Campaign and used his participation in the British People's Games this year to call on other countries to give legal status to homosexuality.
He expressed himself openly on the subject because he felt lucky that he had been given the opportunity to live openly and without consequences and wanted to give others “hope”.
The triple winner of the World Cup said that falling in love with a man, creating American movies Dustin Lance Black, which he met in 2013, caught me by surprise.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years old, last year, but he said that the waves were never a problem.
"When you were so young," he attended the Olympic games for the first time at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone of his age who had similar rises and downs.
The couple became parents in June, a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said that his "every point of view" changed.
"If you were to ask me last year, it's all round around I have to win the gold medal," he said.
You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Ruby."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with cancer.
Daley said his father didn't get the fact that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was that they had tickets to the Olympic Games in London in 2012 -- because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be here to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand while his breath stopped and only when he stopped breathing really and finally got rid of him that he wasn't unsuccessful," he said.
One year later, Daley was involved in the Olympic Games of 2012 and won the Red medal.
"I just knew that I had dreamed of it all my life-- to be out fronting a home audience in the Olympic games, it wasn't a good feeling like that," he said.
It is also what inspired him to choose his first song - Proud of the Summe - which he identified during preparation for the Olympic Games and still makes him a duck skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC's 4th radio on "A" at 11:15, according to British summer watch.
Michaelson was disappointed in the performance and went down to the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
The American golf player Phil Michaelson will set a record on A's day when he plays 47th time on the Ryder Cup, but he'll have to step up the performance so that the event doesn't become an unhappy feature.
Michaelson, who participated in the two-year event for the 12th time and found it a record, went down to the bench according to the decision of the Red Fairk Sea during the football and four-ball games on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as used in the games with the U.S. team, Michaelson, who won five times at the Major Major, spent half of the day as a cheerer and the other half working on his game on the sides in the hope of correcting the ill-treated one.
So, 48-year-old Michaelson is not the only choice for La Golf-Sinonell, where the long tracks of grass are not usually excused for misbehavioring.
And if the competition itself is not dramatic enough, Michaelson, in the 9th game on day A, attacked the exact British champion, Francisco Molinari, who cooperated with the starting player Tommy Peltywood and won all four of their games this week.
If the ambition of the Americans, who lost four points at the beginning of the only 12 games, was to succeed in the early stages, Michaelson's game could have been necessary.
Firich expressed confidence in his player, though we didn't expect him to say anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, swung me on my back, scratched his arm around me and said that he'd be ready tomorrow," said Fairrick.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's a member of the Hall of Glory, and he's added a lot to those teams before, and the week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I was expecting more, but that's how it developed and that's how we thought we should go on.
He wanted to be on the track, just like all the other players."
Michaelson will break Nick Paldo's record with the highest number of games in the Ryder Cup on A.
That might end his career in the Ryder Cup, which never really match his personal record tops.
Michaelson's winning 18 wins, 20 losses and seven skirts, although Pyrk said his presence added certain non-human benefits to the team.
"He's amusing, serxist, sanctuary, he likes to make fun of people, and he's more than in the dressing room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun playing with him this week, and it was nice to see it.
It's got a lot beyond the game itself."
European Captain Thomas Beren knows that the greatest advantage could soon disappear.
Thomas Byron, the European captain, knows from an attempt to make a significant difference before the last day's only Rider Cup games can change for the better.
The Danish player started his game in Waldrama in 1997, when his partner, Svet Belstros, had a five-point lead on Americans, which almost lost when he crossed the finish line with a small lead and won 14 1⁄2-131⁄2.
"I keep reminding myself that we had a great advantage in Waldrama; we had a great advantage in the game in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderama, where we won but with a small advantage," said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching victory 5-3, at Turner 2018 on day and 'and yesterday, which led to Lion 10-6 bl.
Then history will prove to me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
We need to give it all tomorrow.
We need to get on track and do all the right things.
It's not over until the dots don't appear on the board.
We have a purpose, we try to win the cup, and we need to focus on it.
I said all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of those who stand in front of us on the other side -- the best players in the world."
Bjorn was happy to have his players on the hard golf track and added: "I think it's important that you never put the latest ahead of all about golf.
Tomorrow can be completely different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on personal performance, which is completely different.
It's a pleasure to be on the track when everything goes well, but when you're there alone, so your full ability as a golf player is under test.
And that's the message that needs to be delivered to the players: you need to make the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now, you leave your mate behind and he needs to make the best of himself.
Unlike beren, the leader of the fighting G.E.P.P. will expect better personal performance than his players, compared to their performance in the couples' games, except for Jordan Pacific and Stan Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Fiurik himself knows the winning side and the missing side, during the important final days of this type, after participating in the winning team in Brooklyn before the loss, when you were selected as a European team who won a miracle in the final game, as documented in the film "Mirecle at Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Kranshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but I want to succeed in the early stages, as you saw in Brooklyn, and as you saw in Medinah.
When this momentum goes to one side, it's putting a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We're preparing our compound, consistent with and bringing the guys on track according to the feeling we have, you know, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the struggle, and he'll face Rory McLroy at the top game with Paul Cassie, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ian Pulter, who are the rest of the Europeans in the upper half of the rating.
"I chose the team of players in this fine, 'cause I think he'll get us to finish," said Beren when he referred to his only choice.
Germany's new warship was repudiated.
Germany's new Navy frigate was to be accepted in 2014 to replace the old warships during the cold war, but it was rejected at least a year, due to damaged systems and the rise of an outbreak, reported domestic media.
The receipt of Rheinland-Pfalz, the new Baden-Württemberg-class Prefectship, was now rejected until the first half of 2019, according to a report of the newspaper, which said that he had quoted a military speaker.
The vessel was supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but disturbing issues after the supply shut down the Gaul on the Shafrian project.
All four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class, which the Navy invited in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-Class frigates.
It is expected that they could have a powerful cannon, missile batteries against aircraft and ships, as well as controlled technologies, such as apocalyptic signatures, infra-domas and low radar.
Other important features, including longer maintenance periods, could be the most new ones to be destroyed for up to two years from home.
However, the meaning of repeated delays is that the new ships -- which are meant to allow Germany to send overseas forces -- will become obsolete until the moment you enter the service, mention pretty much.
The F1225s of luck came to the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Vos in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Marine Corps had returned a ship to build ships after they were taken away.
Not much is known about the reasons behind the rehab, but the German media cited a number of critical "recommendation and demilitarization" that made the warship useless for use in the battle mission.
The software tracks were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg-class fleets would be operated by about 120 sailors - as half of the team used in the older, Bremen class.
In addition, it has been discovered that the ship has an additional dramatic weight that reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future waves.
The Rheinland-Pfalz ship's weight is 7,000 tons, and it is two times as heavy as the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to the construction software, the cost label of the entire project - including the training of the team - also becomes a problem.
It was reported by shocking rumors of 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) over the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems are putting on the newest frigates, especially in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Perter Bartles, the head of the German Parliament Security Committee, confirmed that, today, the Navy has confirmed that "the ship's fleets are capable of making an invasion".
The official source said that the problem was accelerated and increased over time, since old ships were out of service but were not replaced by other vessels.
He expressed his regret that nothing could be added to the Navy.
Scotland's National Fund is listening to bat secret life.
A new study conducted at a farm in Scotland is about to reveal the way bats use a viewer to hunt their food.
The hope is that the findings will re-establish the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and will help guide future conservation activities.
The study of scientists at Scotland's National Fund will track large-scale bats and European bats, as well as the hot Doventon bats and the long-term eardrums of the Infra-Bellow Islands in West Russian.
Special tapes will be located on key sites around property to track bat activities throughout the season.
National Health Service (NHS) teams and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
An expert voice analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat readings and who of the species responsible for them.
At the next stage, the map of the living areas will be written to create a detailed picture of the appearance of the appearance, the patterns of their behavior.
Most mail, a natural conservation consultant for the National Fund of Scotland, hopes that the results will find out which areas of life are the most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the advantages of managing the areas of living, such as creating brotherly cattle and how to best maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The bat populations in Scotland and throughout Britain were significantly smaller during the previous century.
They are threatened by development and construction, which affects the production and loss of living areas.
Spiritism and blindness can also be a threat, and it is true of certain lootings and chemical treatments of building materials, as well as domestic attacks.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their nighttime hunting habits, bat ears are more useful in every way to catch prey.
They use sophisticated technology to trace insects and identify obstacles to their flight route.
The NTS Fund, which is responsible for the treatment of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major genes and 760,000 tons of land throughout the country, is very serious for bats.
She's got 10 trained experts, who are doing surveying, Kenya tests, and sometimes even rescue.
The organization has also set up the first and only unit dedicated to bats at the Ta' Rave in Damascus and Galavi, which is used for eight out of the 10 bats in Scotland.
The director of the House David Thompson said that the estate was the ideal territory for them.
We have a great area for bats here in Bett Rave, he said.
We have old buildings, a lot of ancient trees and all the appropriate living areas.
But many things still don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and other assets will help us to understand more what they need to thrive."
He stressed the importance of testing the bats before carrying out maintenance work in the assets, since untargeted destruction of a single consumable nest could destroy up to 400 females and puppies, possibly even destroying an entire local population.
The bats are protected and killed, the harassment and interference of bats or the destruction of their nest areas, are prohibited by law.
Elizabeth Pearl, a Scottish official at a bat conservation fund, encouraged the public to give a shoulder and help.
She said, "We have a lot more to learn about our bats and many of our species we just don't know what their population is."
Ronaldo cancels the rape charges while lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine.
Christiano Ronaldo called the rape charges against him "Pike News", saying that people want to advance themselves by using his name.
His lawyers are getting ready to sue the German news magazine "Pigel," who published the charges.
The transfer of the Portugal and Viventus teams is a rape charge for an American woman named Kat's Mygura, in the Las Vegas Hotel in 2009.
He suspectedly paid her $375,000 later to keep you silent about the incident, reporting Dr. Spiegel on day and day.
Ronaldo, 33, turned to his 142 million followers in Instegram, a video that lived a few hours after the claims were published and called "Pike News".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said yesterday, Pike News, told the player who won the "War" at the "Five.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's good.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Dr. Schegel for the charges, which they referred to as an "incompatible report of privacy suspicions", according to Roberts' report.
Lawyer Christian Schretz said that the player would seek compensation for "the amount of moral damages consistent with the content of the infringement, which is obviously one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the last few years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Casino Hotel Palms in Vegas.
After meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Miguela returned, according to the report, to the player's room and the player allegedly raped her, according to documents filed by the District Court of Clark Nouda.
Myorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told her that he was a "good guy" at 99% who was disappointed in "one grip".
The papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but they agreed.
Morgana also claims that she turned to the police and that her injuries were taken in a hospital, but then she agreed to settle outside the courthouse because she felt "fear of revenge" and was afraid to be publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old girl says she's now interested in breaking the arrangement because she's still suffering trauma as a result of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Riel Madrid of Manchester at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he went to the Uventus Italian Club in a deal worth Euro100 million.
Brixite: Britain will regret forever the loss of car manufacturers.
Britain will regret forever if you lose its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after the Barkzit, the British business minister said, Greg Clarke.
He added that the British Toyota's interview to the CBC, where he said that if Britain left the European Union without an agreement, it would temporarily stop the production at the Brenston factory, near Derby, there was a "depress".
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the delayed effects on the Brcizite borders without an agreement could be on the job.
The plant in Bernston, which produces the U.S. and U.S. samples of Toyota, produced close to 150,000 vehicles last year, with 90% going out to the rest of the European Union.
From my point of view, if Britain goes without an agreement from the European Union at the end of March, we'll see the production break in our factory, "Marvin Cook, CEO Toyota in Brenston.
Other British car manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the European Union without an agreement and how it will affect cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW, Wigwar Land Rober.
BMW, for example, says it's gonna close its mini factory in Oxford for a month after the Berkezite.
The main concerns are about what car manufacturers call "the risks of the supply chain" in the case of Berkezit without an agreement.
The line of production of Toyota is run on a "just in time", with parts arriving every 37 minutes, providing British and the rest of the European Union, for the production of cars by order.
If Britain leaves the European Union without an agreement on March 29, it may cause disturbances at the border, causing the population to say that they could lead to delays and loss of parts.
Toyota can't hold a stock of more than one day at the factory in Derbyshire, says the company, so the creation will stop.
Clark said that Teresa May's "Cres" program, which details Britain's future relationship with the European Union, is precisely designed to prevent these tests at the border."
"We need to get to an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement we can, as I said, not only to enjoy success in the present, but also to take advantage of the opportunity", he said in the Today program on radio channel 4 of the B.B.C.
"The evidence is that it is possible to continue to use the successful range of supply chains, which we have until today, is absolutely essential."
Toyota didn't say how long the production break would last, but longer, she warned that the extra costs would be damaged by the factory's competitions, and that eventually, you would get rid of it.
Peter Dubalaris, who worked in Bernaston for 24 years, serving as President of the United Association at the factory, said that the union's more and more concerned members were: "My experience, if the jobs were reduced, they would never be restored.
A government speaker said: "We have proposed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
A Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be dropped again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is often dependent on her, could be "a week off" while the fight over the Supreme Court candidate, Bert Kwano, continued, said the White House on "A".
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller, who investigates Russian intervention in elections, links Trump and Russia's assistants and possible obstruction of investigation procedures by the President.
The gossip in Washington has been dealing for months with whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General and thereby endanger Muller's independence.
Earlier in the month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein Dan could carry a surveillance device to record the calls with Trump and cause the President's rejection by means of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But the last day he came to the White House, and according to the reports he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for the day of the Trump, which was held at the time of Rosenstein's arrival at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he'd rather not fire Rosenstein but at this point the meeting was rejected to prevent a collision with the hearing at the Senate Legal Committee, where he testified to us and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On day and day, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of claims against Kwano, and again rejected the vote in the Senate.
Trump's spokesman, Sarah Sanders, showed up at Fox News on "A."
In reply to the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There's not yet a date for the meeting, it might exist this week, I can see her refusal another week considering the case in the Supreme Court.
But we look like I'm always happy to update the press."
Some reporters have been visiting this session: Sanders has not had a press briefing for the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace is the guide to why.
Sanders said that the frequency did not come from the television reporter's position check, although she said, "I won't deny the fact that they're in position."
Then she suggested that the direct link between Trump and the press be increased.
“The president has more questions and answers to questions than any president,” she said, adding without quoting evidence: “We have examined the numbers”.
The press release will still be held, said Sanders, but if the press have a chance to present questions directly to the President of the United States, it's a lot better than to talk to me.
We've tried to do this in many cases, and you've seen that in the past few weeks, and meetings that will allow you to speak with the President of the United States will change the guidelines of the press.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open meetings or for press reasons during respectful visits.
For his press only, they're rare.
This week in New York, the president may have picked up the reason for this, in a loose appearance, and sometimes strangely in front of reporters who were gathered in place.
The health service writes to the European Union staff at NHS Scotland and deals with concerns about the Barkzit.
The Health Service wrote to the working group of the European Union, which is engaged in the National Health Service of Scotland, to express the country’s gratitude and to request that they remain after the Barkezite.
The Scottish Parliament Gin Freeman sent a letter less than three months before Britain came out of the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to the ownership of requests for status for the citizens of the European Union working in its famous public service.
Ms. Freeman wrote in a letter: "The summer negotiations between Britain and the European Union on exit continued, and it is progressing towards the expected decisions in the fall.
But the British government has also given its credibility to a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this time may be very anxious for all of you.
That's why I wanted to go back and say how much I appreciate each member of the team's contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from all parts of the European Union and the world bring with them valuable experience and skills that strengthen and break the work of the health service and that are useful to the patients and to the congregations we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we want you to stay here very much."
Christian Abercomy has an emergency operation after he has had a head injury.
The back guard from the Tansey University of the University of Trents, Christian Abercoummy, had an emergency operation after he had suffered a head injuries from loss 31-27 on Saturday to the Vanderblit University Commodores group, reporting Mike Organ from the Tanzanian.
Rod Reid, head coach of Tansey University, told the reporters that the injury had occurred shortly before the middle.
"He went to the lawn and just collapsed there," said Reid.
The artists and the medical team gave an Abercomy oxygen on the side of the field and then put it on a lantern and took it for another test.
A Tancy University Officer told Chris Harris from WSMV Nashville in Tadsinsi, that barcobee was transferred to the Wenderblatt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are still no details on the type/provision of surgery and the University of Tance is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Aberkumi is an athletic student and this is his first season with the University of Tansy after transfer from Illinois.
He's just been in five repairs before he got out of the game, and he's raised his schedule for the 18th season.
Foreign buyers who are friends with higher stamps when buying property in Britain
Foreign buyers who will be admitted to higher stamps while buying property in Britain and adding income will be used to help homeless people, according to the new conservation plan.
The move will neutralize Corbin's success in attracting new voters
The stamp tax checks are charged to those who don't pay taxes in Britain
The treasure expects the tax to recruit up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers with higher rates of stamp taxes when we buy property in Britain - plus income will be used to help homeless people, announce Theresa May today.
The move seems to be an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbin's success in attracting young voters, with promises to provide cheaper housing and to focus on high income owners.
No. The stamps will be imposed on people and companies that are not paying taxes in Britain, and the extra revenue will strengthen the government's move to help those old people under harsh conditions.
Pay, which comes in addition to the current stamp tax, including higher tax levels on second-hand residences and real-time investments for rent -- may reach a three-per-cent height.
The treasure expects the march to recruit up to 120 million pounds a year.
According to the estimate, 13 percent of the newly built assets in London are purchased by foreign residents, the situation that makes prices expensive and difficult for people who first acquired property to set a foot on the housing ladder.
Many rich areas of the country -- especially in the capital -- have become ghosts because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a bulging to help young people acquire a first house.
He charged large companies with the price of precious property, since they were taking land but not using it, and he urged Ms. Mei to abandon the coverings on homes at a reasonable price and to fix Britain's "departure terror".
Corbin announced a series of strategic reforms offered in the area of housing, including control of the rent and the cessation of execution "not guilty".
He also wants to give the Council greater power to build new homes.
"Last year I said that I would devote my term of office to the restoration of the British dream -- which is that Qariro is supposed to be better for every new generation.
And that means a repair of our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build lives here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live in Britain, and also companies that are based in foreign countries, can easily own homes as hard as British employees.
The dream of becoming homeowners has become too far away for too many people, and the humiliation of sleeping in harsh conditions is too real."
My ultimate location is to run Scotland.
Sunderland's manager Jack Ross said his ultimate identity was to become the Dutch director at some point.
42-year-old Scotty is delighted with the Noor East's launch challenge, which is currently in third place in the first league, three points from the top of the rating.
He moved to the summer light stadium after leading St. Meren back to the first place in Scotland last year.
I wanted to play for my country as an actor.
I once participated in an international game, and that's it.
But when I grew up, I watched the Scotland team playing in Hampden a lot with my father as a child, and it was always something that pulled me back.
Anyway, this opportunity will only come if I manage the team."
The former directors of Sandland include Dick Edbukett, David Moiz, Sam Eldice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Foyy, and Paulo de Kanio.
Aloha's former director-in-law says he wasn't afraid to come after names based on such a big club, after having rejected proposals from Ernestie and Ipswich Town before.
"For me, success right now will be studied according to what I can do to get the club back to Fremir Ligg'?
Because of the construction and the facilities in this club, he certainly belonged to the Fremir League, he said.
"It's not an easy task to bring him there, but I can see myself as a success story here only if I can get the club back there."
Ross started his management career only three years ago, after a time as assistant manager in Dhamberton and 15 months as team coach of the Hearts Group.
The next time he helped the god to get out of Gilead, he brought St.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his game career at Clyde, Hartholpole, Polkirk, St.
"It must have been a real stop," he recalls, about taking over the lord.
"I really believed the management position fit me, more than the game.
It sounds weird because I played okay, I made a reasonable profit, and I enjoyed a few reasonable qualities.
But an actor's career can be difficult.
There's a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still dealing with you guys all about stress and stress at work, but management just feels right.
I always wanted to run and now I'm doing it, and I've never felt more comfortable with myself as an adult."

The perfect hour for Vincent beer is at 17:30 a.m. on Saturday, in the poll.
The great heat wave of British placards fighting for their existence, but has caused stress in the restaurant networks.
Groups of pubs and barons enjoyed higher sales of 2.7 percent in July -- but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent, revealed the data.
Peter Martin, a business consulting firm that compiled the data, said: "The meaning of continuing the clear weather and the long participation of England in the world championship was that of June, with the parties rising by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants suffered even harder.
The decline was 1.8 percent in the trade in restaurants that were observed in June, but only in July.
Pavs and bars focused on drinks recorded the strongest performances, with a higher growth from the decline in restaurant revenues compared to the previous period.
Paps focused on food have also suffered from the sun, although their condition was less dramatic than that of restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to get a drink.
Among pub and bar networks, the sales of drinks rose by 6.6 percent over the month, and the food bill went down by three percent."
Paul Newman, an RSM analysis firm, said: "These results continue to show the target we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of sports events or important social events are the most important factors in all of this.
It's not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to last year, would be particularly painful as well as for half the regular costs.
The long and hot summer couldn't have come at a worse moment for food-focused businesses, and time would tell if the most rewarding temperatures we've experienced in August would bring out what they need so much."
The growth of the sale of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was about 2.7 percent in July, and the slow pace of the branding.
The sales control factor for the British papier, barbarians and restaurants is the Coffer Peach Tracker, the collection and analysis of performance data from 47 groups, with a combined business cycle of 9 billion pounds, and it measures the level of performance determined in the sector.
One out of five children has social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
A survey revealed that one out of every five children -- some are just 11 -- have secret accounts in social media that they hide from parents and teachers.
polling, which included 20,000 middle school students, revealed a growth in fake instincts
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20 percent of the students said they had a "head" account that they showed to parents.
One of five children -- some of them only 11 -- creates social media accounts that he keeps secret from the adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid growth in fake instincts - as a reminder of the location of the image sharing, insteger.
The news has raised concerns about the dissemination of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they were running a clean head account to show their parents, but they also had private accounts.
A mother who ran into the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found out that she was asking others to "repudiate me."
The study, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the HMC of British Schools found 40% of students aged 11 to 18 having two profiles and happy of them admit that they have private accounts.
Head of HMC, Mike Botanan, said: "So many teenagers are tempted to create local spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eiled Dale will be used as a voice for athletes at the Scottian athletes' board.
Eiled Dale was elected Director of the Scottish Ethics Department for External Rectification at the annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
David is the most lighted athlete and President Ian Beatty described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who guide the sports branches to benefit from her rich international experience during the last decade.
"Elid has been highly respected among the Scottish, British and World Italians community and we are confident that the Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from what you have found to be the directorate," said Betty.
"I am eager to be used as a voice for athletes, and hopefully I can contribute and really help with sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 and 400 meters in the Olympic Games in 1996 in Atlanta, and four Olympic gold medals in total, and now used regularly at the BC network, lost his ability to go after he suffered a brain stroke.
He wrote in Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said only time would tell if it was dark or how bad.
It was a cold job, but I was completely healed, I re-learned how to go and now perform rapid and rapid response exercises!
Thanks for the cheering messages!
Procrastination of milk pumpes, comparing mothers to cows that participate on the Internet
A milk pump company has created opinions on the Internet that compares motherhood to the love of cows.
To mention the pump bag that is supposed to be the first soft milk pump ever worn in the world, Elvie's technology firm published a Hororist video advert to demonstrate the operational freedom that the new platform provides to mothers.
Four true mothers dance at a cow barn full of crayons to the sounds of a song that's like, "Yes, I'm pacing myself, but you can't see a tail" and "in case you haven't noticed it's not my breasts."
The song pizzle continues: "Swift, swaddling, I'm feeding the babies, sucking, sucking, I'm milking my girls."
But the ad, published on the Facebook page of the company, has caused a dispute on the network.
With 77,000 observations and hundreds of responses, the video received mixed responses from viewers, and many said it sheds light on the "fevers" of the milk industry.
"The decision is very bad to use the fruit to publicize the product.
Like us, they also have to get pregnant and give birth to milk, but their babies are stolen from them within a few days after the escape, and someone wrote.
Elvie's milk pump combines prudently within the clean front (Elvie/Mother)
Another response said: "Truely, it's tragic to have a cow and bear as one.
But hey, why don't you use them to publish a milk pump to mothers who get to keep their babies?
Another response said: "A completely dissipated publication".
Others protected the commercial, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was funny.
I think it's a genius idea.
I'd buy one if I was still a maniac.
The heat made me feel just like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I've taken it into her.
It's a genius product. It's written to someone.
A further response said: This is a funny ad for twins who are friendly (often in their workplaces or in the bathroom) and feel like "pox".
It's not aware that he's running or judging the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women's team finds out they all danced with the discreet pumpes inside their bras.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women, who use milk powder, say they feel like cows.
But Elvie's pump is totally quiet, without pipes and wires, she's carefully blending in the cleanup front and giving women the freedom to move, to hold their babies, and even to go out during the warming.
Anna Bellarin, a partner in charge of the early childhood development department, stated: "The Elvie pump is such a creative product that she received a bold and probocative drink.
In creating a comparison between women who claim themselves and cows, we wanted to put the milk powder and all the challenges in it, and to demonstrate in a spectacular way the sense of freedom that the new suit would give.
This isn't the first time Elvie's blade does headlines.
During London's fashion week, Mom took two kids on the track for the designer Martha Jacobowski using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children were transferred quietly to the O’dam camp at Texas border
The number of immigrant children in custody was reduced even though the number of months of border crossings remained relatively unchanged, and one reason was that the bush and the state of the Trump manager had made it difficult for children to pass on to sponsored providers.
Usually, most of the sponsors were immigrants without documents themselves, and they feared that they could stay in the country by presenting candidates for responsibility for a child.
The risk of a man in June, when federal authorities have declared potential sponsors and other adult domestics, will have to deliver fingerprints, and these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Mathew Albens, a senior officer of immigration and property, testified to the Congress that the authorities had arrested dozens of people who had submitted to care for minors without supervision.
The permission later confirmed 70 percent of the detainees had not been criminal in the first place.
"Nearly 80% of the insured persons or their homes are illegally located in the country, and a large part of them are criminals from foreign countries.
That's why we keep chasing these people," said Mr. Albens.
In order to take care of child benefits more quickly, officials introduced new laws that required some of them to appear before a court within a month of their arrest, rather than 60 days after being accepted according to previous regulations, shelter workers reported.
Many show up through a video conference, instead of face-to-face, to present their arguments for legal status before a immigration judge.
Those who are not entitled to release will quickly be expelled.
As long as these children are cared for, they are more likely to develop anxiety and depression, and this can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, says the shelter workers and reports published by the system in recent months.
Counselors say these fears increase in larger facilities such as Toronto, where signs of the child's difficulties are likely to be overlooked because of the size of the facility.
They have added that the transfer of children to the city of O’dams without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to separate from friends can make the trauma that many have already been coping with worse.
Syria says to the American, French and Turkish powers to back off too much.
She is at the U.N. General Court, Foreign Minister, Walid Al-Muerve also called the Syrian refugees home, even though the war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Disappeared, the deputy Prime Minister also said that foreign forces were on illegal Syrian soil, under the excuse that they were fighting terrorism, and they were treated accordingly.
"They have to withdraw too much and no conditions," he said to stop.
Dismissively, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been attacked from their homes.
He said that Dach would continue to fight this sacred battle until we cleansed the Syrians of terrorist organizations and "every illegal foreign presence that she is" as one.
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and consulting the troops and Syrians who oppose the President as well as Al-Asad.
France has more than 1,000 warriors on the land of the country.
In any case, he said that the conditions for their return were good and that the charges of "some Western states" in the "unreasonable fear-sharing" that had moved refugees to stay away.
"We called the international community and the humanitarian organizations to help them return," he said.
They're making policy into a matter that's supposed to be humanitarian only."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria's reconstruction assistance will not be sent until a political agreement between Essad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish an armed zone in Idolev, the last great rebel army, has created an opportunity to advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turki agreement prevented an extensive attack of the Syrian forces in support of the province, where three million people lived.
However, the congruent stressed that the agreement was a "clear deadline" and expressed the hope that military action would focus on the war-fighters of Judah, including warriors from the triumphal front linked to the Al-Qaida organization, which would be destroyed.
UN Secretary Stefan de Mistura hopes to meet soon with a new committee, composed of members of government and opposition, to move a draft of the post-war treaty and to pave the way for election.
He said that the panel should be limited to “to examine the scope of the present constitution” and warned of interference.
Why does Trump get a second chance?
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberals see, there is an obvious hope, rejection and scandal that he will end his term in advance.
While there is no doubt the most dramatic ending in the history of the presidents all the time!
Right now, there's no sign of fatigue for the viewers.
Since 2014, at the time of the peak, the peaks have risen to 1.05 million viewers in C.N.A. and almost lent themselves to 1.6 million viewers in MSNBC.
Fox News' average stands at 2.4 million viewers in record hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MarchNBC "Richel Mado" show, reached the head of the cable's ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on important news nights.
"It's the fire that people are going through because it's not something we understand," said Neil Bar, the actual producer of the ABC drama series, "the designated survivor", dealing with the Secretary of State who becomes president after the attack destroys the beer.
Lanel Skubal, an ancient comedy writer and writer, "Only the funny parts: and some hard truths about fertilizing into the Hollywood men's celebration" has another theory.
She remembers a cab trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
She asked.
He said, "Because he's kidding me," she told me Mrs. Skubble.
There is a lot of value in radio broadcasts.
Of course, unlike all the other TV programs, Washington's credit lines could determine the future of the "Rot Against Wade" verdict, whether immigrant families could reunite and the health of the world economy.
Change of channel or ignoring is a tolerance that only the most specialized viewers can afford.
And yet, you're part of the boundaries that you've been having as a civilized citizen when you've been watching for six hours at a panel of lawyers using Bob Woodward as a source of "Frescist Intelligence" as a source of "Fear" and "Bomb Bombers of Appeal" worth $15,000 in the amount of Paul Nafort's "Fire-Fire," according to the Washington Post) and the consequences of St. Daniels' past history on, and forgiveness of the protest, Trump's anonymity.
I, for example, would never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does, which feels like that of a reality show, is that he feedes you at something every night," said Bert Montgomy, CEO of Heelhouse Entertainment, and created the "historic for sales", about the team that replaces the Trump Show and the high-level daily approaches (the NFL League war, the Gong-on praises).
You can't afford to lose one chapter or stay behind.
When I got to Mr. Place this week, it was clear outside with a temperature of about 26 degrees on the north coast of the island of Kawai, but he challenged to watch MSNBC, and recorded the C.N.A. in parallel.
He couldn't break up, not when Bert Quano prepared to stand up to the Senate Legal Committee and the future of the Supreme Court depends on the balance sheet.
"I remember the times we've done all these crazy shows before and people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," said Mr. Place.
I thought it was a joke, but apparently they were right."

Finances from external sources features the race for the lowest middle-level selection, Congress
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district is facing a flood of funds, thanks to the re-organization of Congress, which brought the two congressmen's race on the same seat.
The District Fair of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been rediscovered, has placed the Democratic Representative Connor Lamb in his seat in another district, with special elections in the last spring.
Lamb ran against another congressman, Republican Keith Ruth's Poss, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which is well under way with the 17th district boundaries.
The maps re-martto after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the previous district dispute had been misdirected, and contrary to the law, the results for the Republicans.
The new 17 district race launched a battle against financial shocks on the election journey between the financial weapons of the major parties, the Democratic campaign committee (DCCC) and the Republican campaign committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a sale name in Pennsylvania after winning a special election on March, which won an expanded view, for the 18th Congress County of Pennsylvania.
The seat belonged to the Republicans for over a decade, and President Trump won a 20-point district.
Political thinkers expected an easy advantage for the Democrats.
The United States of America has been able to punish El Salvador for its support in China, and then retreated.
The diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already met Big'ing, with slight opposition from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos and Arla, in June 2017, and held the hotel in Panama until his partners removed the Trump management team.
Foreign office officials decided to return the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a response to the "last decision not to get to know more in experience", said Thor Everett, the secretary of the office, at the beginning of the month.
But the sentence was only imposed against Salvador, which was estimated at $140 million from the United States in 2017, which included drug control, development and financial support.
The penalties offered, which included economic aid cuts and restrictions focused on entry visas, could have hurt the country from Central America, suffering from unemployment and high-level homicide.
During the progress of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America rejected an urgent committee that should have focused on safety and economic prosperity as a continuation of a similar conference last year as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from reaching the United States.
But in the middle of September, senior government officials made clear their wishes regarding the promotion of the convention, and thus concluded all the rules of punishment against Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pance is now supposed to address the conference participants, who are now set up in the middle of October, as a symbol of the government's concern, the diplomats said.
And three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new messages or new severe punishments from Washington.
The White House speaker, from Bolton's taste, refused to respond to the discussion details described by the three American officials, and in the course of two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussions, provided they remained anonymous there.
Their explanations were made by an external analyst, who was close to the government, who also spoke anonymously there.
Learning History
The obvious thing is that the report of Special Adviser Robert Muller on the alleged violation of Trump's investigation, whose backs now have significant evidence of public records.
Muller is turning his investigation, according to the reports, into the question of whether Trump's election trip worked with Russia in its attacks on our electoral system.
If control in Congress changes, Trump will find himself judging and accounting for this body, just as soon as he prepares to stand before the electorate again, and perhaps even before a jury.
There are a lot of questions here that start with Em and I don't intend to argue that Trump's fall is inevitable -- not even the same as his equivalents in Europe.
From both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers would have been willing to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West would have opposed him and supported them in two parts of the country.
We failed, and we missed a chance to prevent the resulting deaths.
History moves around such turning points, and an unimpeded democracy race is slow or slow.
The Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires General Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein's been in trouble since the newspaper reported last year he secretly proposed to record the president and raised the remarks about his ill-adjustment to the president.
Rosenstein said the Times report isn't accurate.
How do we react if the F.B.I. investigation of the recently requested Bert Kwano, is incomplete or fair - or if his appointment to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false witnesses is confirmed?
And above all, are we going to vote for the mid-dependence election and a congressman's reservation to Trump's responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter long winter sleep.
But I believe we won't fail because of the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was Jewish because she was driven to Oswich by the Nazi regime, which was also a sheep in the magnificent house I had.
She survived, moved to America, and 60 years later, sent me to light candles on the same table carrying the cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Graham Durance from the Ringing's Optimal to the Raffid Vienna debate
Ringing's having Raffid Vienna on the day of the day, and knowing that we will win the Australians, after the impressive case against Viriel in Spain earlier in the month, will place them in a strong position to be doubled by Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Durance from showing up for the first time in the season until the 2-2 with Viral, but he believes that Ring's could use this result as a jumpboard for better performance.
"It was a good point for us because Viriel is a good team," said the 31-year-old footballer.
We went out to a game of faith we could get something and we got a point.
We could've won the end, but, all of a sudden, the tie would probably have been a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we got out of the stasis in the second half and we were the best group.
Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it'll be a tough game because they got a good score in their last game, but with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can push and get a positive result.
The last year has been really hard, with everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but there's a good feeling about the place right now.
The group is good and the guys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can move on now, put the last season behind and make it work.
Women stay awake because of this fear about saving pensions.
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, only a few people talk about it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the NationWide survey said they were talking to their partners about the cost of long-term nursing care.
Only 10% said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to conduct the conversation," said Holly Schneider, the vice president of the Nationalewide Life Security Society.
We can do this next way.
Talk to your spouse and the kids: you can't prepare your family for treatment if you don't express your wishes long before the deadline.
Use your counsel and family to discuss where and how to receive treatment, since these choices can be significant in determining cost.
Send out your financial advisor: the consultant can also help you find a way to pay for the expenses.
Your funding options for long-term medical care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a sum of money to help with the spending pocket, or self-security with your debt -- as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: Find an early solution to legal struggles on this occasion.
They found a health force, a reliable person who will oversee your medical treatment, and make sure that the professionals do what you want in case you can't communicate.
They were also able to sign a power charge for all your funds.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions in your place and guarantee the payment of accounts if you are not competent.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your adult parent has a medical emergency and he's on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs or allergies?
Show those details in the written plan to be ready.
"The financial side is not the only important point, but who are the doctors?" Question Martin.

A man was shot a few times with an air gun in Elfroomb.
A man was shot a few times while he walked home from night to night.
The victim, in the 40s of his life, was in the Oxford Grove area of the elprombe, in which he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hand.
Cops described the shooting, which happened at 2:30, according to the British summer watch, as "a random act."
The victim didn't see the person who attacked him.
The injuries he suffers are not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people found their deaths in an earthquake and powerful tsunamis that hit the city of the Indonesian Palo, said official sources, and where the dead are expected to rise.

Federal prosecutions claim a rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal defendants in New York ask for death sentences for Sipolo Sipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been carried out for a federal crime in the country since 1953.
A 30-year-old chipper was used on the charge in the truck of Hamppo's rental to carry out a motorcycle attack on the side of the South Manhattan West Side Highway, and a tracker and bike rider that hit October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the defendants must prove that Syppob had deliberately killed the eight victims and had caused serious injuries to the body, according to a statement of intent to seek the death penalty, which was filed in the southern quarter of New York.
According to the court document, death penalty can be imposed on two of these indictments.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury to Sipov with 22 indictments, including eight charges of extortion aid, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and violent attacks and destruction of vehicles.
The attack called for significant planning in advance, the defendants said, and described the way in which he carried out the attack as "magic, cruel, and sick."
"Sipolo Bevelbwez" has caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Enrique Angnie, Nicholas Kelves, Ann-Laur Duddak, Darren Drake, Ariel Arigge, Hernan Protzhii, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damien Pinoku," written in the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the south quarter of New York claims death penalty in the case occurred a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after their conviction to contact a spy for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Two Rosenberg couples were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Sipov, born of Osbekstan, did not express regret in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about his actions, said the police.
Sipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to attack after watching the movies of Rabbah on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to the police, he also asked to hang a flag of burning in his hospital room.
He claimed to be innocent in response to the 22-year-old indictment.
David Paton, one of the federal defenses representing Sipov, said they were "dejected of course" by the prosecution decision.
"We think the decision to seek a death penalty instead of receiving a confession of guilt that leads to a life imprisonment that is impossible to release, is only a date for the continuation of the trauma of these events on all those involved," said Paton.
Sipov's defense team has previously asked the defendants not to warrant death punishment.
A member of Parliament that Marnie says there's got to appoint Niig La Prague as the negotiating officer for Berkezite.
Niig La Farage made a pledge to join the army of the people today during a protest at the Conservatives' Congress.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must sense pressure from the extremists - when a member of the UKIP Parliament of the Teresa May Party claimed that it should be responsible for negotiating with the European Union.
Parliamentary Governor Peter Bonn said a campaign in Bramingham, Britain, was already outside at this point if Farage was acting as Secretary of the Berkezite.
But the challenge in front of him, May, has been met by a series of guards supporting the European Union in a different demonstration against the Barkzit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her divorce plan, the Cross, on the way in spite of attacks by the Brcizite supporters, the remaining supporters and the European Union.
The Alliance insisted that it continue to try and reach an agreement with Brysel in spite of the opposition's reactions - and forced the Russians and the Liver Party to choose between its agreement and ‘Vehue and Boh.
Boone said at the Leave Means Leave Group meeting in Seoul that he wanted to say goodbye to the Kres.
He claimed that Prague had to be accepted as a friend and be responsible for negotiating with Brysel.
If he was in charge, we would've been out at this point, he said.
Parliamentman Wellingborough added: "I'll protect the Berkezite, but we need to break up with the Kres."
He highlighted his opposition to the European Union and said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be slaves.
We want to set our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bonn dismissed the claims that the public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: the idea that the British people changed their mind and want to stay is totally false.
The Security Parliament and its support of the Barquezite Andrea Jenkins were also a campaign and told the reporters: "I'm simply saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people."
The Crass show is not popular among the broad public, the opposition will not vote for it, it's not popular among our party and our activists who went out on the streets and chose us in the first place.
Please, abandon the hook and start listening.
In a critical message to May, she added: “The heads of government keep their service when they keep their promises.”
Farage said at the conference, that it should make politicians feel the pressure if they're going to betray the decision that was made on the people's question in 2016.
It's now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political status, he said.
They're trying to betray Braczyzte and we're here today to tell them that you can't get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to make us our political standing to betray Braczyzite, to feel stressed.
We call this country's people's army, who gave us the victory in Braczyzite and who will never rest until we become independent, self-prejudiced and proud Britain.
At the same time, the supporters took a step in Bramingham and then there was a two-hour conference in the center of town.
A handful of actives were exploding against Braczyzite after the group was set up this weekend.
The member of the Liver Lord Sirs praised the opening of the conference for the security problems they suffered with the party's appellant.
It's about people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all possible technology to conclude an agreement such as Canada plus plus plus, to cross a border without friction and free trade without borders in Ireland, he added.
It's totally ridiculous.
There's no such thing as good Brixite, he added.
Warren's planning to consider seriously.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's "consider seriously running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic Senator of Massachusetts and SATs was thinking about a future during a town meeting in the west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who regularly visits President Donald Trump, faces the mid-dependence election in November against Republicans G.P.D., who served as a co-chair for the Trump election campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was in the rumor center that she might be dealing with Trump in 2020.
It's the 36th meeting that took place at the Fortnight of the City Building, which has been held since his entry into the role of Trump.
One in attendance asked her if she was going to run for the president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to arrive in Washington to fix our broken government and to get a woman to stand in the head.

The police published a video of the shooting on day and day, and asked for help with the identification of a man seen in the photos.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed by a campus at South-South University early in the day and the day.
"Wide Simms suffered from a gunshot wound in his head and eventually died from it", told the press on Saturday, chief of police Murphy J. Paul, as reported by 247 sports.

Grand Perry, Russia: Louis Hamilton ends up with a world degree after the teams' exercises gave him a victory over Sebastian Walt.
Clearly, from the moment Walter Botass stepped up the next step before Louis Hamilton on Saturday, Drogi of the Merdes Group would fill an important role in the race.
For the first time, Botas had a good start and he left Milton almost alone when he protected his place in the first two rounds and invited Walt to attack his teammate.
Walt went out to the middle stop first and let Milton fit in with the competing tail, a seemingly necessary decision.
The Marsdes team came out for a inter-circuit stop later and went back to the race behind Walt, but Milton moved forward after a tight wheel struggle, eventually forced the Ferry driver to leave the inner track to stand without risk after a double-tracking in the third corner.
Max Verstapan, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back line of the rating and was in the seventh place at the end of the first round.
He then led for a large part of the race and did not change tires to get a quick finish and crosses Kimmy Rayconn to the fourth place.
He ended up in the middle of the 44th round and was unable to speed up the pace of the remaining eight rounds when he was a sheep in the fourth place.
It's a hard day because Walter did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me get around him.
The team did extraordinary work to get to Debal, said Milton.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump was proud of Senator Diane Feinstein's conference on Saturday, in connection with her insistentness that he had not leaked a letter from Christine Blaise Ford, accusing Bert Kwano of the Supreme Court of sexual assault.
During his speech at a conference in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, and instead said that what happened in the Senate showed that people were “bad, aggressive and liars”.
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people angry, angry and lying," he said.
And then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... Did you leak the document-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
So, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak, he added in the Senator's imitation.
Fainstein received a letter from Ford detailing the charges against Kwano in July, and he was released earlier in September -- but Fainstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide the charges of Dr. Ford, I didn't leak her story," said Finnstein to the committee, according to the reports of The Hill.
"She asked me to keep his confidentiality and to keep the secrecy of the letter as requested by me."
But it doesn't seem that the Senator's denial was accepted by the president, who responded to her during the meeting on Saturday night: "I tell you, it was a really bad language.
Maybe she's not [the leak], but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to protect the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, claiming that the Democrats use charges for their purposes.
"They are determined to return to rule at all costs.
You see the evils, the arrogant, who they care about hurt, who they're going to rule and power," said the president, according to a media report.
High League: Dandy Stars with a result of 5.3 against the giants of Blacks
Patrick Davere was a sheep of two waves for the giants against Dandy.
Dandy's stars blew up their losses in a high league on a day, and they won the next 5-3 game on a Saturday.
The giants had an early benefit from the two waves that Patrick devier and Francis had invented in Willier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cunny brought their group back to the business until Davey returned the advantage to the giants.
François is the equivalent of the Dandes until two waves of Lucas Landwald Nielsen promised the victory.
This is the third loss in a high-level league season for Adam Cuff's team, who came back to beat the 2-1 dundes in the blapst, day and time.
This is the fourth meeting during the season between the two groups, and the giants won the previous three games.
Davier's first skull arrived at a fourth minute at 3:35 cooking Kendall McFall, and David Ruth's Ford cooked the Bavier's skull when he doubled the result four minutes later.
In the first three full-time activities, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 until Matt Markworth cooked the Kony's equal skull at 15:16.
Javier promised the advantage of the giants when he went out for the first break when he reached his second skull in the evening, at the end of the first third.
The house team was re-established, and the rest re-created a circle worth the power game at 27:37.
Canni and Charles Corkran brought together forces to help Nielsen give the first time a lead to Dandes in the game, at the end of the second third, and Nilsen promised the victory of the dandes with the fifth circle, which reached half of the field in the last three.
The giants, who lost four out of their last five games, will face their home court against Milton Queens in the next game on day and day.
A pilot who sacrificed his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on the plane could escape an earthquake
An aircraft captain in Indonesia was described as a hero after sacrificing his life to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers was safely evacuated.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a severe earthquake hit the Sulawesi island on a day and caused a tsunami.
Strong convulsions continue to hit the area and many people are trapped in the destruction of the city of Palo.
But although many of his colleagues escaped to save their lives, Annas Gnawan Agoong 21, refused to abandon his position at the airport control tower with the strength of the airport Motara Seas to Gaffrey in Palo.
He's staying in place to ensure that a 6321 flight of the Batik Air Company can take place safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought he was falling off.
He died later at the hospital.
Dr. Air Nabigish Indonesia, Johannes Sirite, said that he might have decided to save hundreds of lives, according to an ABC News network report.
We made a helicopter from the airport at the airport of Alikjan in Clementen to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palo.
“ Our hearts are broken to the hearing of the good news, ” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the death row may reach thousands because the Indonesian agency's statements of relief relief, access to Dugella, Sige and Botung are limited.
According to the source, the death toll will continue to rise because many bodies are still buried under the debris and access to many others is not possible, says the agency's address, Satopo Porvo.
At a height of six feet [60 m], Palo was destroyed and the city was buried in a cab burial on the day of 'A'.
Military and commercial planes bring relief and equipment.
Risa Cosma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances bring bodies every minute.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-Market shops are everywhere."
Jan Glpand, standing in the head of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running fast to help survivors but we don't know what they're gonna find there.
Now it's a tragedy, but it can make a lot more worse."
President Wakou and Vidho of Indonesia, came to Palo on Sunday and said to the statemen: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks associated with the execution.
Are you ready?
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by landslides in Bloombok, where more than 550 people were killed.
A plane crashed in Micronesia: A New Guinean Air Company says that one person was missing after crashing a plane in the lagoon.
The airline, which operated the flight crashing in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, now says that one man was missing, after the previous announcement that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the plane.
Air New Guinea said the announcement that it started in the afternoon on Saturday, she couldn't say what happened to one passenger's fate.
The airline said that it works with authorities, hospitals and local investigators to try and find the man.
The airline has not responded immediately to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water, while trying to land at the airport of Chik Island.
Officials said on a day and seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and that the condition of all the rest was stable.
The reason for crashing and the exact move of events is still unclear.
The U.S. airline and the U.S. Navy said that the plane landed in Laguna a short distance from the track.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane missed the course.
U.S. passenger Bill Jens said the plane reached a very low track.
"That's a very positive thing," said Janes.
Janes said he and the others were able to take their way to emergency exits in the wet height of the plane.
He said that the plane crew got nervous and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who worked nearby on sand improvement also helped with rescue operations, using a smoldering boat that brought people to the beach before the plane landed in water which was about 100 feet (100 feet).
ANS data suggest that 111 people have been killed in the setbacks of the new air carriers in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but that none of these incidents have been involved in the air carriers.
An ally details the course of events the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution proved her plea on Saturday, in a retrial of a man who was accused of being in the hands of a Mississippi woman while she was alive in 2014.
The U.S. Attorney Paul Roult's Office of Justice has been witness to for hours as an expert in the field of intellectual surgery.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to link the prosecutor's movements, 29-year-old Quinton Tales, and the victim's movements, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night she was murdered.
According to the fishing calories report, Roult said he received the location data from a number of mobile phones that showed that Celis was with Chambers on the night he died, thereby concealing his earlier claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chembers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went out to talk to Sanford.
Sanford boarded the witness and testified that it wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Talis was true when he said he was with Sanford that night, Sanford said he was a liar, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another mystery was that Telis said he knew Chambers two weeks before she died.
The cell phone records confirmed that they knew each other only for a week.
Roult said that some time after Chambers's death, Telis deleted the text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He deleted her from his life," said Hale.
The defense starts with her closing speech on Sunday, according to planning.
The judge said he expected the trial to be transferred to the jury's debate later that day.

Another black man?
New York therapist is suing a couple for dismissal after a "racial" text was read.
A New York therapist is suing a couple for being fired on the ground after receiving a text that was not intended for her from the mother who complained that the therapist was another black person.
The denied couple that he was racist and compared the claim to extortion.
Lindsey Flasco-Flexman, two, expressed disappointment when she found out that her new child care provider, Giselle Morris, was black at the time of her first working day in 2016.
Laaaaaaa'a Another Black Man, wrote Mrs. Flasco-Flexman to her husband in a text notice.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
According to a report from New York Post, after she had noticed the plausco-Flexmann had fired Mrs. Morris, saying that the former African-American therapist had done a bad job, and that she now expected to hire a Philipn in her place.
Mrs. Morris got paid for one day's work and was sent to her house with Ober.
Now, Morris sues the couple for the divorce, demanding $350 a day for six months of work and living where they were originally hired, but without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, don't do things like this," she said to Poste on a day and added, "I know it's a plague."
The couple returned a war on the allegations that they were racist, and said that the end of Morris's business would have been demanded, out of fear that they could not trust her after they had hurt her.
My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
"We're not racist," said her husband, Val Flasco, to Post.
But did you have your child in the hands of someone you were rude, even if it was a mistake?
You're your soft baby?
Come on."
Flasco compared the claim to "wronging" and said his wife was only supposed to have two months before the event and she was in a very difficult situation.
Do you want to go after someone like her?
It's not nice to do something like that. Add the investment banker.
The court case is still in proceedings, but the court of public opinion quickly reduced the couple in social media, killing their behavior and arguments they used.
A new letter reveals that Fedington's publisher feared that the readers wouldn't be identified with a speaking bear.
Bond's daughter, Karen Gannel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said about the letter: "It's hard to imagine yourself in the place of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know what we know now about the vast success of Peddington."
After saying that her father, who worked at the BBC as a photographer before he was inspired to write the Children's Book about a little toy, would have become a bloodthirsty about the denial of his work, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book was a "Mary-Dear" after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of Fedington's success, which he described as a very important member of our family.
"He was a quiet man, not a arrogant man," she said.
But because Peddington was so real to him, it was almost like you have a kid who gets something: you're proud of him even though it's not really because of you.
I think he saw Fedington's success kind of like that.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always said it was because of Peddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was transferred to the hospital in Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life.
Ned called clean and said that it was really bad, and it wasn't expected to last." Mrs. Ednan Lapros said.
Then I got a call from Mand where he said she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashie, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave her to keep going are slowly gone and out of her system.
She died sometime before, and it's over. It's all over.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing it all happened.
I couldn't walk or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people right now.
I really had to hold on."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan Lafaros, now mourning her daughter's loss, boarded a plane with other passengers who were not aware of the last escape.
Nobody knew," she said.
My head was a possession, and tears went down all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had an amazing sense of identity with Ned.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women wearing postcards on the bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly were able to land a bridge in Walsh with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people could call to receive support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any other parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45-year-old, who lived in Bladney, said her son was a promising chef with a infected smile.
Everyone recognized him because of his smile.
They always said his smile lit up every room."
But he stopped working before his death, 'cause he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the same time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm afraid without a break from chain response."
Mrs. Davis created the postcards, so people would know there's someone who can be approached and talked, even if it's a friend.
- Don't sit down in silence. - You need to talk."
Mrs. The Paris, Mrs. Davis' girlfriend since then, has lost Mark, a life partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed or anything else," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at the bottom of the stairs on Christmas Day, when the kids opened the presents, he didn't make eye contact or something."
She said his death was a terrible trauma for them, but they got over it: "It creates a hole in the family.
It rips us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Bert Kwano's future is at stake when the FBI begins its investigation.
I thought, if we could really get what he asked -- a time-limited, limited investigation -- maybe we could bring a few to the union, he said on Saturday and added that fear that the committee was "screw apart" in the loosed dead end.
Why wouldn't the Republicans and their supporters be interested in the FBI's investigation?
Their receding is all about timing.
The mid-dependence election will take place only five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as observers, the Republicans will not succeed, they will be very weak in their attempts to elect the man they want to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to hire them to support Kovano, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI gets his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are today.
It's not clear whether Kwano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pens to break the tie and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of NORWAY NORWAY KIND
The number of North Korean Americans to South Korea, has fallen since the Gong-on started ruling seven years ago, saying a South Korean lawman.
The Bong-Sig Park quoted data from the South Korea Union Office and said that the number of applications last year stood at 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the main factors for this were a more serious border review between North Korea and China, and that it contained the lower amounts of human fugitives.
Pyongyang didn't make a public statement.
Most of the northern Korean refugees eventually get South Korean citizens.
According to Seoul, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, where North Korea has the longest border, which is easier to cross compared to the military territory (DMZ), which is well maintained between the two countries of Korea.
China treats orphans as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and often brings them back to work.
The relationship between the North and the South, technically still in the war, has improved dramatically in the last few months.
Early on, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focusing on negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
The meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the United States of America Donald Trump and Kim Gong-on in Singapore, where the two generally agreed to act towards a time when half of the Korean island would not hold nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Rie Yong-ho, accused the sanctions that the United States missile has been unable to make since.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no chance that our weapons will be individually broken down first, said Ri in his speech to the U.N. General Security in New York.
Nancy Plucie calls Bert Kwano Historic, and says he's not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The underprivileged leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Plucie, called the Supreme Court candidate Historic and said that he was not allowed to serve in the Supreme Court.
Flossy responded to that at a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Washington, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever showed up like that, they would say "historic",
Kwano has been emotionally repudiating the allegations of sexual assault by Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when both of them were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes he screamed and choked when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
It is also a garden for Democrats in the committee, calling for arguments against it: "murder of a consistent character and a grottsky organized because of the liberals' anger that Hillary Clinton lost in the election to presidents in 2016.
Flossi said that Kwano’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it had shown a prior opinion against the Democrats.
"I think he broke down with these statements and the way he was chasing the Calvins and the Democrats," she said.
Flossey hesitated to ask whether you would try to decorate his appointment, and if the Democrats were to win most of the House of Representatives.
"I say so -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not right, not only to be assigned to the Supreme Court, but also to the court where he is currently ruling," said Flossey.
Quano is currently serving as a judge in the Federal Court for Columbia County riots.
Flossi added that a democracy, she has concerns about possible rulings of Kwano against Obama's health reform or a verdict against Wade's, since he was considered judge Shemran.
On his confirmation hearing, Quano avoided requests regarding the possibility of repealing certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"There is no reason why a hysterical man and a briber of his views would come to court and expect to be told, "There is no such thing as "It's great."
And women need to use it.
It's a cruel criticism, months and years of anger on his backs, and she can't express them without crying.
"We cry when we're upset," said Mrs. Steinen 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, do I?"
She continued, "I got much help from a woman who was running elsewhere, who said she cried when she got upset, but she developed technique and every time she got angry and started crying, she used to tell the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad."
And then she just pulled up.
And I thought it was brilliant."
The tears get as much as the rage among the others because they are not built at the same time.
One of my most meaningful memories of early life in the office with most men, is that I found myself crying with indescribable rage, and an older woman caught my back, it was a cool manager that I was always a little scared -- and dragged me to the stairs.
"Don't let them see you're never crying," she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they got you down."
Patricia Schroeder, who was at the same time a congressional congressman, worked with Gary Hart during the presidential election tours.
In 1987, when Art caught an extramarital Roman manager on a ship named Monkey Business and came out of the race, Sheroder, who was deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she would not consider the idea of running the presidents herself.
"It wasn't a decision I thought well of," she told me 30 years later and laughed.
There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it "Salgia and the Seven Flames."
Because she joined the election campaign late, she was able to raise funds, so she swore that she would not join the race unless she recruited $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She found out that some of her supporters, who paid $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"They think I'm getting a discount"? She was wondering.
At the time of the speech that announced that you would not start a formal election campaign, the feelings were so intense that you thanked the people you supported, you could count on the system so much on raising funds and focusing on the selection in place of the delegates, and anger over the sexual darkness -- it was so teary.
"I could have thought I had a nervous breakdown," she recalled, "Ruder in a way where the press responded to her.
"It was possible to think I was sponsored by McClinx.
I remember thinking, what would they write about my situation?
"She cried"?
How the U.S. trade war between China can be beneficial to Big'ing.
The opening guns of the U.S.-China trade war had eardrums, and even though the battle is far from over, a gap between countries can be beneficial for long-term Beijing, says experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. president, fired the opening shot earlier this year when he taxed important Chinese export products and solar, steel and aluminium.
The most significant settlement took place this week with new views that affected products worth $200 billion (150 million LT), raising taxes on half of the goods delivered to the United States in China.
Big'ing returned every time in the same coin, and recently raised the peaks by five to ten percent on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has made a commitment to strike all over the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will surrender in the near future.
The request from Washington to return means giving up her demands, but a public pledge to the United States would be too embarrassing for the president of China, Shi Ginfing.
However, experts say that if Big'ing manages correctly, the pressure from the US Trade War can be positively supported in China in the long run, narrowing the gap between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the beginning of economic traffic in each of the countries is actually far more dangerous than those seen in the past," said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia, in the thinking team of the New American Security.
Syria is ready to return the refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says it's ready to return from the wishes of the refugees and calls for assistance to rebuild the country that was destroyed in a long war that lasts for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Musef said that conditions in the country are improving.
Now the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the war on terrorism, he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to restore the situation to normality.
All the conditions are now in place for the return of the refugees from their free will to the country they left because of terrorism and unilateral economic steps, which were intended to harm their daily lives and their finances.
According to UN estimates, over 5.5 million prisoners have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Musbeth said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that the regime would not receive a gift or assistance from states that had named the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup and destroyed the U.S. team with a final result of 16.5 - 10.5 on a course with a National golfer outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row on Europe's soil and has not won the Reider Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again when Captain Thomas Beren's team arrived at 14.5 points required to defeat the United States.
The U.S. planet Phil Michaelson, who fought the entire tournament almost, sent his shot to the water from the 16th floor of Far-3, and lost the game against Francisco Molinari.
The British Italian golf player in all his tours, became one of the four players who have reached 5-0-0 since the beginning of the tournament in the current building, in 1979.
American actor Jordan Sadefas 5 and 4 was defeated by the lowest-ranking player on the European team, the Verbian Olsen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the biggest player in the world, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Potter from England, which may be the last time he played in the Ryder Cup.
With a record of eight participations in the Ryder Cup, the Spanish Sirg'yo Garcia became a European actor with the highest winning number in the tournaments with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't resist.
It was a hard year.
So I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so glad to have the cup back.
It's the team, and I'm glad I could help.
He's passing the torches to his country, John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in the only game on Sunday.
"The great pride I feel, defeating Tiger Woods, where I watched as I grew up," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France and his chair is now on 13-21-3, when the Ryder Cup is in career.
It's strange statistical data from one of the best players at all times, who won 14 important theaters, where he is only a Gke Niklaus.
The U.S. team has struggled all weekend to find its way in lawns, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Pinau, who played high-level golf all over the tournament.
Captain of the U.S. Sea Fairrick's team spoke after the disappointing performance of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment in the morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Good for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll reorganize, I'll work with the U.S. professional golf association and our Rider Cup Committee and we'll move on.
I love those 12 guys and I'm proud to be used as a captain.
We need to take the hat off.
Hobosno."
