You're talking like it's my fault.
You talk so fast, I don't understand a word you said.
You think I'm fat, don't you?
You two are stupid until it's hot.
You two should be a lot in common.
You used me.
You've been in love with me before, haven't you?
You've smoked before, haven't you?
You've assessed the situation completely.
You were a great crowd.
You've been trapped.
You've been trapped.
You've been trapped.
You're being drugged.
You've been very good to me.
You were so good to me.
You were so good to me.
You were very quiet.
You convinced me.
You have a little heat today, don't you?
You have to raise your voice.
You were shot.
You found the right opponent.
You win!
Thank you!
You wanted to tell me about the freedom?
You want a beating?
You want to watch a French movie, don't you?
You've been worth 70 pounds.
You'll be advised.
You focused.
You were mine.
You were my life.
You've never been like him.
You're not being questioned today, are you?
You weren't jealous.
You weren't jealous.
Glad to prove that this trial was deleted, right?
They told you to let go.
You were Tom's only friend.
Be a good diplomat.
You won't even know I'm there.
You'll talk to such a freaky man for nothing.
You won't be there in time.
You won't tell them, will you?
You won.
You won.
You won?
Would you do that for me?
You'll never understand.
You don't know what you're talking about yourself.
Yumi will use this camera tomorrow afternoon.
