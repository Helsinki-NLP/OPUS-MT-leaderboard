AMs from Wales are afraid of "being seen as a fool"
There is consternation among some AMs following a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This has been raised due to plans to change the name of the Welsh Parliament assembly.
AMs across the political spectrum are worried that this will make them seem ridiculous .
AM Labour said his group was concerned that "it has the same sound as Twp and Pwp."
For readers from outside Wales: In the Welsh language twp means silly and pwp means raw.
Plaid's AM said the whole group 'was not happy and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative from Wales said his group had an "open mind" about changing the name, but noted that there was a slight verbal difference from MWP to "Muppet".
In this context the letter w in the Welsh language is pronounced in a manner similar to the pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptor of what should be called Assembly Members will of course be a matter for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government's 2017 act empowered the Welsh assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that had broad support for calling the assembly a Parliament of Wales.
On the issue of AM title, the Commission favoured Members of the Parliament of Wales or WMPs, but MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
Apparently, AMs are suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching consensus could be a headache for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft legislation on the changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include further changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on the question of how to be called when they have a debate on legislation.
In Macedonia they leave public opinion in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was set with the aim of finding a solution to a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name stands for .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite over the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the consequence of entering the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stop ringing as churches in Harlem are sending
"Historically, the elders I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner," Mr Adams said.
"Today, there is no."
He said he could understand how the bars disappeared.
He said, "People are socializing differently today."
"The bars are no longer the center of activity of the locality where people go on a regular basis."
As for churches, he worries that money from asset sales will not last as long as leaders are thinking, "and sooner or later they will end up where they were in the beginning."
He added that churches could be replaced with apartment blocks with condoms filled with the kind of people who would not help the rest of the locality's sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in this building would be a white carnation," he said, "and thus, they will not be sad when the day comes when they are created for these churches because it is very likely that many of these people who enter these condominiums will not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by congregations of white-carnage people before Harlem became a metropolis of white-carnage people - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St.Martin's ten years later.
The original Methodist Congregation of white carnations left in the 1930s.
A congregation of black-carnage people practicing nearby religion took the title for the building.
St. Martin's was taken by a congregation of black-cargo people under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers at 125 Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who resisted renting to or promoting black-cargo people.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson's and successor to St. Martin's, was proud when he called the carillon "the bells of the people."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it "a cultural treasure" and "a unique historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that she was the first carillon in the world to have a black-carnation musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who walked for the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not change with anyone else.
What has happened in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought in by the leaders of the lay church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The 'vestry' - the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "will seek to pass on the costs" to the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in engaging the architects and contractors who sent it from the diocese.
Some of the parishioners complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Sea dog injures 13-year-old boy while diving for lobster in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was sneezing with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then went to him with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the after excitement of catching a lobster, but then "he realized that he was shouting, 'Gidem me!
Giddy-up!"
"We've been through it all," Hammel said, realizing the moment the boy had arrived.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
They took the boy by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
The Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said in a media meeting that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries in the upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with rack corridors similar to those of a department store of beauty products equipped with specialist assistants.
As part of substantial revenue in the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of clothing and home-use items decline, the larger corridors with beauty products will be tested at 11 stores across the country and the idea will spread to more stores next year if it is successful.
The investment in beauty came after supermarkets were looking for ways to use the shelf space that was once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's said it will double the amount of beauty items it is offering up to 3000 items, including firms such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have more space with branded areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch the range of its Boutique make-up so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that is increasingly demanded by smaller buyers.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will examine concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, in Lower London, last week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food every day at local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to buy from there.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, said the stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight the Aldi and Lidl discount shops with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been putting Argos' stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitats since he bought the two chains two years ago, which he says has boosted grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the tie ended after a fight over how to split revenues from pharmacy stores into his supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan, he said, adding an expanded range of luxury skin care firms including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to be appropriate for every need and the attractive environment and convenient shop positions mean that we have become a beauty products destination of interest that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'very raised' after Holly Willoughby cancels <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den personality Peter Jones 'very angry' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for the firm of home products and their accessories, Truly.
The pair's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's firm, Goop.
This morning's presenter, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce she would be leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' personality Den Peter Jones very angry because she cancelled being part of their business of a very money-making lifestyle firm at the last minute - to focus on her big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "very angry" when the very popular television personality admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his enromedous business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that its new deals - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant he had not had enough time left to trade.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop's firm and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce that she would be leaving with Truely, Jones left Britain and moved to one of his private lodgers.
A source said: "Truly was by far Holly's first priority.
It would be her long-term future that would fill her the next few decades.
Her decision to leave has left everyone completely amazed.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was almost over.
There is a stuffed warehouse produced at Marlow's headquarters that are ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, which lies among Britain's profitable personalities, could mean a cost of millions for the company due to a large investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and the potential for further delay until its launch.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
A mother of three children, Willoughby and her cousin Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman in March.
The couple travel together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become an M&S brand ambassador and will succeed Ant McPartlin as I'm A Celebrity presenter of ITV.
Last night, a source close to Jones said "We don't comment on his economic affairs."
It's hard to find love, but then we find love."
He joked about criticism he would get from the news media for making a comment that some people consider "non-presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why do you think President Trump is so pissed off?
Trump said with a voice that mimics that of a "news presenter".
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump boasted that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But the denuclearization negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders, on Saturday, at the General Assembly, that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" by the United States to North Korea's early disarmament steps.
Instead, he noted, the United States is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech.
He said, "We're moving well with North Korea".
"We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have a very good relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results - the end of rocket tests, help in the release of hostages and the return of American veterans who had stayed home.
And he defended his unusual approach while talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this arena full of people, we would have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia Destroys Island, Kills Hundreds of People
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they were not needed.
Even after more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had to move out of their homes, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite to catalysing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it was very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it is challenging," said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organising a team to travel to Palu, it is unclear whether foreign personnel can operate on-site.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesman of the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Considering the earthquakes that occur in Indonesia frequently, the country is still not well prepared for the great anger of nature.
While a shelter from the tsunami was built in Aceh, it hardly sees them along the coast.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palo, despite issuing a warning, likely contributed to the loss of lives.
At the best of times, travel between Indonesia's numerous islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship was stationed in Lombok to care for the victims on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improvements to the falling infrastructure of Indonesia, the center of his electoral campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Mr Joko's administration has sent in because of lack of funds as he faces his re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from sectarian tensions still in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of this faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to move from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the street, using 'machetes', bows and arrows and other types of weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool wins points at last minute vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a 'goal' in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was 27 metres away from the Chelsea goal with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball slightly to his left before shooting the ball into the post.
The ball flew over much of the box as it ended up entering the upper right side of the net.
Eventually, the ball dropped behind Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped to try to welcome him, and fell into the net.
"I was trying to get into that position, to get into the ball and players like Shaq always forward it as much as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming at me and I touched the ball once and I didn't think much about it and I tried to shoot the ball."
Chelsea were winning 1-0 to half of the match after getting a 'goal' in the 25th minute from Belgium's Eden Hazard.
The Chelsea striker handed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before leaving running towards the middle of the pitch and then quickly entering the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball in the middle of the pitch.
Then he shot the ball in a very nice way, which led Hazard inside the box.
Hazard ran over the players in defence and sent the ball into the net with his left foot and passed from where Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early on Sunday.
Many people have been reported trapped under the rubble of the building that collapsed due to the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves as high as 20 feet, a spokesman from Sutopo agency Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was filled with rubble from the collapsed building.
Police arrested a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was killed with a knife
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 this morning with wounds from a knife in Grayson Mews on John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area who saw or heard something to speak.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages but I appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to everyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have picked up something on the dashcam videos to contact us as it may contain information that is vital to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon friends who think they know the woman came to the place to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing as police say they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to re-enter his apartment but is being informed by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He had no words when he found out what had happened.

A number of police officers were inside the closed area monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is requested to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and quote log 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's Parliament statue becomes last monument affected by argument over 'rewriting history'
Its removal would be a form of justice suitable for destruction in a manner similar to that of the Taliban, of many of the British religious and cultural artifacts carried out by its fanatic ‘Puritan' followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The 'iconoclasm' of the British civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the evil Cromwell would have been sacrificed to the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of a 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the middle conflict of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable individual figure representing one side of that divide.
His achievements as 'Lord Protector' also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
The Man Who Killed and Killed a Chinese Farmer
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a cut artifact, covered in blood near a pen at Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a hoggery' on 30 May 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
Reportedly, he traveled with his cousin from the province near Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin was found dead, and he discovered a door to the nearby open pig pen.
He said there was blood in his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had attacked the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"Cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," said the cousin, who referred to him by his surname "Wu," as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so as not to attack anyone, while police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Despite being rare, cases of pigs attacking people have been previously recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, and the man ended up critically injured.
Ten years earlier, a 295-kg pig kept a farmer from Wales with his tractor until the animal expelled his wife.
After a farmer's pigs from Oregon attacked him and ate him in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a "cause."
"They're playing.
They bite, they're very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rains in the southeastern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves on the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains across northern Mexico and in the southeastern United States in the coming days.
Rosa brought a 85 mph, Category 1 hurricane wind, at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is forming a ‘trough' over the Pacific Ocean and is moving east to the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to push strong tropical humidity in the north-south direction of the United States
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
Then, a tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching ‘trough' creates heavy rains that will spread to the southeast in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous rapid flooding, debris flows and avalanches' potential in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in parts, especially in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in parts of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Rapid flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered character of the tropical rains.
It would not be a good idea to go out into the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause the canyons to become dangerous rivers and storms will bring local and dusty winds.
The 'trough' will bring some rain to parts of southern California's coast.
Total rainfall of more than half an inch is possible, which can cause small debris flows and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the region of their rainy season.
Some flooding of scattered tropical rains begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more scattered late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain falls in Four Corners on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October there may be some dramatic temperature changes around the United States as the Arctic cools, but tropical areas remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There will be a great example of dramatic temperature differences from the U.S. Center on Sunday.
There is almost a 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
A large part of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures in the 80s spread from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could rise as high as 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be roughly 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecasts are pointing to high possibilities for above-average temperatures for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people witnessed Thursday's highly interesting testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of committing a sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political fight continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming with the shocking last-minute news of Friday: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh babasha when he was under the influence of alcohol and tried to remove her clothes when they were a post-secondary school level party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he is 100 percent sure this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday saw it.
the company was counting the average amount of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen generally finds it difficult to calculate how many viewers there are from offices.
To put this in perspective, it is an audience size similar to that for the decisive football game or for the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was at the forefront of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was right behind him with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, protesters from CNN and CBS cameras were caught on Friday morning and were yelling at him as he tried to climb into the elevator for a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood there with his eyes looking down for several minutes as he was being criticized aggressively, in a live broadcast on CNN.
"I'm standing here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think you're telling the truth to a country?
They said to him, "You have power when many women have nothing."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator doors were closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks were broadcasting live, hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate fully to a vote.
But Flake said he would do so only with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee the following week, which Democratic minorities have long been urging.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was empowered, because it was evident that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "taking advantage of politics" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "taking advantage" of politics and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview after one with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson pressed his attack of the so-called 'Chequers' Plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "completely insane."
Shooting on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson after LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting that killed 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the spot and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports CBS affiliate, WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bond was set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner's office released a preliminary report on Friday, which said the cause of death is damage from a gun from the head to the neck.
The department is granting credit to the Louisiana State Police fugitives' task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and citizens of the area to assist in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement for "due diligence and the pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The striker who was 2 metres tall, was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "lost" and "under shock" after Wayde's death.
"That's what you worry about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano tosses ash on Mexico city
Ashes being dumped from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern outskirts of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was monitoring various tectonic sounds and movements.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering car windscreens in the vicinity of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geography physicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with separatists from Catalonia ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarisation vote on secession.
A pro-separatist group with their faces covered which were held back by anti-riot police threw them eggs and dust paint, creating a dark dust cloud on the streets that is usually filled with tourists.
There were also small clashes during the day and the police had to use the grenades to control the fighting.
Over a period of several hours, pro-independence groups were shouting "Don't forget, don't apologize" to fight unionist protesters who were shouting, "Spain Forever."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries they received in the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions have remained high in the region, which wants independence a year after an October 1 referendum seen as illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose with a large margin to become independent, although participation was low with those opposed to secession who made a large boycott against the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said there was no hope left in the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my mother and father crying with joy that they could vote but now we've given up," he said.
Despite having had a vital and narrow victory in the regional elections last December, Catalonia's pro-independence parties are struggling to maintain momentum this year with many of their best-known leaders either in exile who decided themselves or in detention and are awaiting trial because of their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone in support of police, said the conflict was caused by politicians from both sides.
"There's going to be more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of Catalonia who has been in jail before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he will contest next year's European Parliament elections.
"By standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car crashed into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car drove into a Londonderry home more than once.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Investigator Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
A ‘crossbow' could also have been used to shoot at the car at some point.
Menga's Goal wins 1-0 match for Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first 'goal' for Livingston won the match
Livingston, who was promoted, beat Rangers and thus Steven Gerrard lost for the second time only in 18 games as Ibrox's club coach.
Dolly Menga's ball shot made all the difference as Gary Holt's side was equalised in points with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side have not won a single away in the Premiership this season and next Sunday they will play against Hearts, who are the first and are behind them by eight points.
Before that game, Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna at their home ground in the Europa League on Thursday.
While Livingston continue to lose the division in six matches, with head coach Holt not yet missing a game since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against bulky visitors
Holt's team should have been winning before he had a goal, with his direct style of play causing a lot of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but passed the ball in front of the post, then Alan Lithgow was only able to pass the ball with a wide bod after sliding to get the ball from Craig Halkett's head-struck near the post.
Those who were playing in their own stadium were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, because they knew that they were the visitors who could give them problems at certain moments.
And that's how the crucial 'goal' came about.
Rangers allowed a ‘free-kick' to enter and Livingston took the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to help Menga, who touched the ball and inserted it into the bar from the centre of the box.
Until that moment, Rangers were dominating possession of the ball, but they were finding the defense of the team they were playing on their own pitch, not penetrable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble,
That style of play continued even into the second half of the game, but Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to welcome the ball.
Scott Pittman has been unable to find a 'goal' due to Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow shooting the ball wide after being shot by another Livingston player.
Balls were constantly entering Livingston's box and were always removed from their players, while two requests for 'penalty' - after Halkett's attempt on substitute Glenn Middleton, and another after the ball was touched by a player's hand - were rejected.
Feminomenal' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Performance and phenomenal result for Livingston.
For a man, they were excellent, they continued to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
The style of the games and their staff have not changed much from returning to the main fight, but most credit should go to Holt for the way he has united the team since he arrived.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett's chief was very great at his games, organizing an immensely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warall with seven eyes.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at certain moments under Gerrard, there was a lack of good standards this time around.
Their last chance with the ball was not good - only once they managed to separate the defense of the team that was playing on their own pitch - and it is a sign for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the rankings.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received different reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) there were laughs and a blue sky as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - with the aim of repairing relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a large crowd of 25,000 people from being gathered in front of the mosque, but many people who supported him showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also voiced their voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests against each other reflect the separation of a visitor who is a hero to certain German Turks and is believed to be ‘autocrat' by others.
Road crash in Deptford: Cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist has died in a crash involving a car in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and attended the paramedics, but the man died on the spot.
This crash occurred a few months after another cyclist died after being hit by a car and drove past Childers Street, about a mile away from last Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and bus diversions are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in disorder
Six prison officials were injured after a disturbance in a high-security men's prison, said the Bureau of Prisons.
The disorder began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
Specialized "Tornado" officers were brought in to address the disorder, which involves eight inmates and is located in one of the sections.
Officials were given treatment for minor facial injuries on site.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to address an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year anti-riot officials were called to the prison to address a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with 'pool' balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake city with Flash Floods (Dry Areas May Benefit)
Tropical depression is rare to hit Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week as the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa flows southwest of the Desert, leading to risks of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already set up a rapid flood watch for Monday and Tuesday for from western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line from over Phoenix on Tuesday, and approach late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service Phoenix noted in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status at a distance of 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950"!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of 40 miles from the AZ border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in the Arizona Mogollon Rim.
Other Southwest Desert areas including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to have from 1 to 2 inches, with possible isolated totals of up to 4 inches.
For those at risk of rapid flooding, Rosa's rainfall may be a positive thing as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rain is likely to be beneficial as the southwest side is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the drought monitoring device, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category," reported weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa was led to touch down the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who will still be a very powerful hurricane on Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, will be located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and will move north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific and is therefore losing power.
As a result, it is expected to touch Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or early evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be severe, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with a possibility of up to 10 inches," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, and then will move from Arizona and south of Utah until late evening on Tuesday.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains is very heavy rains in Baja California, in northwestern Sonora, and in the southwestern desert of the United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to produce rapid flooding dangerous to life and debris streams in deserts, and landslides in mountain terrain.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrested after attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old teenager was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in an Excelsior Terrace in the Midsomer Norton area, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
They took him to the hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon, Somerset Police said.
Officials have appealed to anyone who can have a video pulled from a mobile phone of what happened to speak.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'sends greenery and anger' to Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said during a demonstration in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "sent the greens and the anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her allegation.
On Saturday, the President said that, on that day, the "American people saw the bravery and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a jurist with an impeccable public service record", he told the crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not contesting, but in truth, I'm contesting," he said.
"That's why I'm running everywhere fighting for very good candidates."
Trump said Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct."
The first major procedural vote inside the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds have been killed by the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with the number of deaths seen to be rising
At least 384 people have been killed, many injured as huge waves have descended hard on beaches, after a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six metres (18 ft) came crashing down on the ground as it began to darken, while many were injured and died and everything in the middle was destroyed.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and didn't wake up to happen immediately and ended up being victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not emerge on its own, it drew cars, logs, houses, hit everything that was on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had travelled along the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs from the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, bridges that surrounded themselves and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Heavy storms continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in the statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
They said the city's geography, located at the edge of a long and narrow beach, could have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of a collapsed building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications "were totally sent and without information" by Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not informing that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building may be heard shouting alarms with anxiety at the tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within a few minutes a huge amount of water came down strongly on the shore, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to authenticate the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused severe power outages that reduced communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll exceeds 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While World Vision’s staff from Donggala arrived strong and whole in the city of Palu, where employees are sheltering armed tarpaulin shelters in their office yard, they went through scenes of devastation on their way back, Mr Dosebeh said.
He said, "They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed".
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups began the unpleasant process of disaster relief, a few complained about the fact that foreign aid workers with deep expertise were not being allowed to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only start to enter if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet occurred.
"It's still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'O.K., this is a national disaster,' we can bring in international assistance but so far there is no status."
On the second night in Palo after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the still-missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that embellish this story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy came out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days near her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian Paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior person in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional weight," he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how, in the hours after the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had fallen circulated among the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, only marked that they had left, but did not mark that they had arrived.
"I think that means the messages have not been received," he said.
A total of $26,750 will be spent while the ATM is being refilled in Newport on the Levee.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was busy with his job, another man "came running from behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of cash destined for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rap singer changes name to Ye
Rap singer Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he said: "The man who was previously known as Kanye West"
West, 41, was nicknamed Ye for some time and used the moniker as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the program who cancelled for "emotional reasons," the creator of the program said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
"So I am, you are, I am, we are.
From Kanye which means 'the only one', to Ye only - simply a reflection of what we have good, bad, what confuses us, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rap singers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
As one who collaborated with West, JAY-Z, he also served with or without a dash and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he "will never use the military to restrict the Mexican people."
Troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were being set up throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by granting monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more public universities free of charge.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
The United States should double the funds for the I.A.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this area, says IA investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after several parts of the U.S. government made IA announcements, even though there is a lack of a formal IA strategy in the U.S.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be the first in IA innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are much further back than the United States, and we are looking for the next revolutionary step in AI," Lee said.
Doubling the funds could double the chances that the next major AI acquisition will take place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the player with the highest rating of American Othello, and later was executive with Microsoft Research and president of Google's branch in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government competitions in technology such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when she would be the next one, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Lee said that researchers in the United States often have to work hard in order to get government grants.
Lee said, "It's not China that's removing the academic leaders; the corporatists are doing it,".
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed people who inspire others from universities to work on AI.
Lee said the changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen their efforts in the AI.
He said, "I believe the green card should be offered automatically to people who have a PhD in AI".
China's State Council released the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funds to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations issue money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Center of Artificial Intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in IA research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that attempted to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence saw no action in several months.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that had blocked its membership offers to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbour in its north represents a possibility of possession of its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change undermines the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slav majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the turnout will reach the minimum of 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote is read: "You are in favour of membership in NATO and in the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to join bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the change of name of the country giving him the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was setting up a small stage and preparing chairs in front of tents armed by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we must enter proudly under our conditions, not by commanding others," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a result in favor of the name change would be "a confirmation of our future."
A poll published Monday by the Institute for Policy Research of Macedonia said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum - an amount below that of the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the participation should be 50 per cent and one more vote.
If the referendum fails, it represents the first serious blow to government policy in favor of Western ideologies since he took control in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, passes all of Brighton's defence to 'goal'
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his 'goal' in the 65th minute seem very easy.
The striker from Argentina received a ball from midfield at the start of the sequence.
He ran out of three Brighton defenders before rushing into an open open space.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players with green shirts.
He fought with one defender before fleeing much further to the end of Brighton's box.
Then he passes the ball on his left and finds Sterling.
The English striker touched the ball for the first time in the box to redistribute it to Aguero, who used his right foot to insert the ball into the right side of the net by passing it through Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero is having some problems with his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about the fact that he was going to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's how it happened.
We had the good luck of making a 'goal' at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues an initial advantage in the Premier League fight.
That 'goal' took place in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep into the territory of Brighton in that action.
He sent the ball right to Leroy Sane with the left hand side in a very nice way.
Sane touched the ball a little before leading Sterling to the post.
The Sky Blues striker touched the ball slightly and inserted it into the net just before sliding into a territory he was not supposed to enter.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play in spoiler vs. Rockies
Since Nationals were eliminated from the possibility to compete in the decisive game, there was no reason to make an effort to restart.
But the so competitive player Scherzer hopes to be able to be the pitcher on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that the Rockies have the possibility to play in the decisive game, which are ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West in one game.
The Rockies managed to gain a possibility to continue competing with a 5-2 win against the Nationals Friday evening, but are still looking to get the division's first title.
"Although we are playing for nothing, at least we can have the possibility to win by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be playing at the highest level of any point I can face this year.
What would you not want to compete with in those circumstances?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to let Scherzer be the 'pitcher' in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting for the 34th time, held a practice session on Thursday and will be playing as a pitcher on Sunday when he usually rests.
The player from Washington who plays with his right hand is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 'strikeout' in 220 2/3 'innings' this season.
Trump's protests in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation pertaining to the selection for his Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"In November, everything we've done will be threatened.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is very big -- I'm not contesting, but in truth, I'm contesting so I'm running everywhere fighting for very good candidates," he said.
"We are seeing this very horrible and radical group of Democrats, we are seeing it happen now," Trump continued.
And they are determined to take back power by using every possible means, you can see the green.
They don't care who they hurt, who they want to inspire in order to gain power and control, what they want, power and control, we're not going to give them."
He said Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct."
"And I've seen this over the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and green and nasty and dishonest."
He referred to the Democratic Senator ranked on the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein by name, and received many negative shouts from the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Did you get the document?
Uh, uh, what is it.
No, no, no, I'm waiting, first of all - her body movements were not positive at all - the worst movements I've ever seen."
The group is no longer a large group.
Don't allow people to share their opinions
When I was asked by the people in my neighborhood, I didn't get a lot of attention.
After all, I am the most recent MP on a list of Labour Party MPs who were not welcomed in a positive way - because we communicated our views.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she fought against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, issues similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the majority of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Council on Friday evening were exactly like that.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more merciful and gentle" policy has long been forgotten if, in fact, it ever really began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable for the party to lead.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I thought I had a similar political view began to expect me to change my mind and take positions I would never agree with in other situations - either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and, in fact, it doesn't make any difference - I am followed by abuse on social media with a request to remove me from my MP's post, denounce the centre's politics, and tell me that I don't belong in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Yes, I know I've had better luck than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who every day face a lot of sexual or racist abuse but are never hidden from the comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the fact that levels of abuse have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad group and with every motion of "lack of confidence" or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes narrower.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years that encouraged me to keep my opinions to myself, so that I wouldn't be so vocal and then everything would be "good."
But I did not go into politics to do so.
Since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the government's negligence of Thatcher leaving my comprehensive school class literally in a disastrous state, I have sought to improve public services for those who need them most - either as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never lost my job, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been, in any way, confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I'm saying is that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm our families, businesses and public services, I can't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in truth, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to work for you and promise you that no amount of threats that remove me from my post or of your political expediency will deter me from acting in all the best interests of those I believe to be the Labour Party.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, who has not yet lost once, climb to the top in the ranking
Two attempts were able to change the result slightly, but there was no doubt that Ayr was deserving of winning this very exciting day's game of the Tennant's Premiership.
They are currently ranked first, the only team out of all ten who have not lost once.
Ultimately, it was the superior defense, as well as their ability to capitalize on the opportunities, that helped the team, which was playing on its own pitch, win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've gone through trials during our matches so far, and we haven't lost one yet, so I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Give credit to Ayr, they took advantage of the opportunities better than us."
With Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, Ayr were winning, but, a yellow card from Scotland's head Rory Hughes, who was allowed to play the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose an opportunity to try and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's victory with a 'penalty', before, in the middle of the match exactly, he made a 'goal' and converted an individual attempt to bring the points to 17-5 for Ayr in the break.
But Melrose started the second part of the game well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, narrowed the gap by 5 points.
The match was then interrupted by a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who emerged from the pitch on a stretcher, and upon restarting the match, Ayr continued to take points after an attempt by Stafford McDowall, converted by Climo.
Then, Ayr's chief agent Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose came out with aggression when they made an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, after a period of severe pressure.
However, the team playing on their own pitch again began to attack, and when he was given a yellow card Struan Hutchinson for his action on Climo without the ball, from the ‘penalty' line, MacPherson touched the ball to the ground at the rear of the advancing Ayr group.
Climo converted, as he once did almost from the area from which the match would resume, after Kyle Rowe collected the ball he met David Armstrong from the box and sent Gregor Henry, playing side by side, for the fifth attempt of the side she was playing on her own pitch.
Still Game's personality appears to be ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The personality of Still Game Ford Kieran appears to be ready to enter the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he has been named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man who plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular programme, which he writes and shares with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth series will be the last one of the program, and Kiernan appears to be planning for his life behind Craiglang.
According to the lists of official registers, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was seeking to get involved in Glasgow's "very well-functioning restaurant trade."
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen passage to the Pacific
The sailors stand guard of the naval headquarters armed with ropes and chains in La Paz.
Public buildings have an ocean-coloured blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are lined with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty."
Across all of Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of 19th century resources remains clear - as the desire for Bolivians to be able to sail into the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope is perhaps at its highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course it is waiting for the result with positive thinking," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on large screens all over the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find, in favour of Bolivia's statement, that - after decades of uneven talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate and give Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who is facing a controversial battle for his re-election next year - also has much to lose in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia - and that little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to grant Chile's territory, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the ICJ's judgment comes only six months after the final arguments were heard, indicates that the case "was not complicated" said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from favouring the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may not have been helpful.
"The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration," said Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate.
Morales's hostile rhetoric weakened any residual goodwill of Chile, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile, at some point, will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the "opportunity to "end 139 years of discord with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as political aid.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can trust the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to deliver on promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
He passes on his comments as U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears to be about to resume the nuclear diplomacy that lies stalemated more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "hope in the gap" that continued sanctions and the U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will never force North Korea to surrender.
Washington is concerned about whether it should agree to the declaration without Pyongyang making the first significant steps of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an armament that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Trump's second summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest collection of clothes for the massive head that will soon appear in the main stores.
If you want to add to your collection of hats or completely cover the sun, you can stop looking.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a range of strange and very large headwear for their Spring and Summer 2019 collection on the runway that dubbed the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats are appearing a lot on Instagram this summer and these designers have uploaded their surprising creations to the stage.
The object most notable by Valentino was an extravagant beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like edge that completely covered the heads of the models.
Other very large accessories included jewel-covered watermelons, a witch's hat and even pineapples - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than ‘haute couture'.
One creation was like the diving device complete with snorkel and goggles, while another was like a melted ice cone .
And if you continue with this style - good luck.
Fashion followers predict that huge ‘bonnets' will soon appear in the main stores.
The very large hats emerge after the release of 'La Bomba', the two-foot wide-brimmed straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The 'cult label' responsible for the impractical hat nothing that has been widely seen on social media has triggered another great creation on stage - a straw bag containing almost as much as the mesh-clad model they were carrying.
The dark orange raffia basket, surrounded by the small raffia spaghetti and a white leather grip, was the most outstanding creation in Jacques' 2019 Spring and Summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I'm expecting to see large hats and seabags in the main stores for next summer - as the designer has made a huge impact, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for very large accessories.'
John Edward: Essential language skills for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a record of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen career and for their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalised school curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages remain a subject of popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If a man speaks in a language he understands, he understands with his mind.
If he speaks in his own language, he understands with his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examinations, we can see that languages are at the forefront of ranking tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a Higher A degree.
The data, collected from the 74 schools that are members of SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students achieved an A Higher degree in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French and 63 percent studying Spanish achieved an A as well.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages are now, as a subject choice, being held in the same respect as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that from reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career to choose, if you learn another language, this will have a real advantage in the future as it has the ability to survive such a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically places a multilingual person at the forefront of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and, with 15 percent, French is the only language spoken with a two-digit percentage.
That's why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
Knowing more than one language, particularly those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to be successful, no matter what the future may be.
It cannot be denied at the moment, in a global business environment, that languages remain very important for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be seen as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
The faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
On Sunday LeBron will play for the first time with the Lakers in San Diego
LeBron James's sports fans have not had much time to wait for him to start for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game before the start of the season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the number of minutes to play has yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell wrote a tweet that, likely, James will play a limited amount of minutes.
After the practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-match schedule before the Lakers season starts.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself," he said.
Trump's Manifesto in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first appearance out of five scheduled next week, including stops at friendly venues including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote suspended for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in Nov.
What's the story behind Trump's campaign in West Virginia and how do you see it online?
Trump's demonstration in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's demonstration in West Virginia online below through a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become intense over allegations of sexual misconduct with an anticipated Senate confirmation vote suspended for up to a week while investigating the FBI.
But the primary goal of this wave of demonstrations is to help Republicans face the November elections to gain some momentum.
President Trump's campaign said the five demonstrations next week were aimed at "giving energy to volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
"Congress Control is so important to this agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we approach the busy campaign season," a spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening's demonstration can gather supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state that won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is losing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team determined not to give up on Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swing pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sport concept but one that players really believe in, and never more than in such competitions.
So, where do you think the momentum is now?
"They were in the lead with six points and now we are with four, so I think we are carrying this as a bit of momentum," said Jordan Spieth as he left during the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead with twelve more to play.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel but that they have a few obstacles and have a lot to encourage them, not at least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each of them boasted by three points out of four.
Spieth was accurate from tee to green and is leading by example.
That cheer of celebration continued to grow as he continued his round, making a crucial putt to bring the fourth match evenly when he and Thomas were two down after two.
His putt that won them the game on 15 was met by a similar shout, the kind that tells you that he believes the American team is still there.
"You have to go deep and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
This is what each one of these players has left out now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but sweet couple of Europe are four by four and considered perfect.
"Moliwood" were the only pair not to score a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the following nine Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy seems to move both to and from this live crowd establishes that it is the players who are offering a challenge on Sunday, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun descends on Le Golf National from Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at once on different holes.
But here we are talking about a European glory that is still early for her.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were soon completed by Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when they were put in a pair with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the front nine put the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they never managed to get close to.
But there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to see closely because of the peer interactions, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can be changed in a second.
Europe played better as a team so it came this far and is in the lead on the final day but this foursomes session also showed that the U.S. Team has the determination that some, especially from the U.S. side, were questioning.
Europe ahead with 10-6 on final day of Ryder Cup
Europe will take a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's fourball matches and foursomes in the lead with 10-6 over the United States.
Inspired pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made the effort with two wins over Tiger Woods who found it difficult to take their score so far ahead at the Le Golf National for four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, ready to hold the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American side that went wrong in the morning fourballs, taking the series by 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but were unable to reach the scoring difference.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points out of Sunday's 12 single-player matches to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first new European for the season to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to have won four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
Having dominated over Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs then worked excellently to win over Woods who did not seem optimistic and to the new American player for the Bryson Dechambeau season with an even more empathetic score of 5&4.
Woods, who found difficulty in both matches on Saturday, showed occasional moments of brilliance but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in the fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, cheering for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes for a 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are ranked first and third in the world.
But it wasn't all the way to Europe on a beautiful day, with a little splash in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a great winner for three times, and Justin Thomas set the limit for the Americans by two points Saturday.
They secured a 2&1 bold victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in the foursomes after losing both opening holes.
It was only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team returned from a four-point difference while entering the singles, although the owners of the Furyk side need a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after being second best for two days, Sunday's counterattack seems to be going to be more than they can do.
North Korea says it will not "in any way" unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening its mistrust of the United States and that there was no way the country would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "considerable measures of goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated familiar complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would have been rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significantly to have not rejected unilateral denuclearization without thinking as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work towards "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to reduce tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive manner, and even objects to the 'declaration of an end to the war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can break us is a dream of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party to this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a blockade."
Despite this, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the continental United States with North Korean rockets was inevitable after "Mr. President Katti" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much work remained to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeline for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't make a difference."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on Thursday, told the UN Security Council that: "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and without stopping until we realize the verified denuclearization in full and final."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with the aim of halting funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, after North Korea in a few hours criticized him for making "gangster-like demands".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "corresponding measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on taking enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has managed to get all of its undergraduate students to sleep longer with the aim of fighting the growing macho culture of studying all night and staying awake thanks to caffeine.
An academic found that students at the university in the first place in the world often do not have an idea about the basic true things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, believing it to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after making a speech about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
"At last a girl came up to me and said, 'Why are you saying this to me now, in my last year?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which started for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials about how good sleep traditions help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had a serious insomnia during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to tell them about the effects of caffeine and light and about how athletic performance has an effect from a sleep deficit, and the importance of sleep time.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged insomnia can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - as much as you have a right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke cigarettes," added Prof Czeisler.
The culture of being proud to "get you up all night studying" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students meant that insomnia was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you get enough sleep, and of good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of a student to combat stress, severe fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to prevent weight gain, since lack of sleep puts the brain in a hunger mode, which makes them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, who is studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having attended one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to pursue a course around the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduating students to make a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students should consider making an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as for when they wake up, and know about the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can upset your circadian rhythm, and lead to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeats Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another period of sadness when they played abroad as Dolly Menga's strike delivered Steven Gerrard's split side to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
Ibrox's side were looking to make a record of their first win while travelling from February's 4-1 triumphal win at St Johnstone, but Gary Hold's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as manager to leave his side eight points away from the big L'Hebrad leaders.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time and the list of uninspired Rangers players never seemed to catch up.
While Rangers now descend to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and only behind Hibernian on a goal difference.
And there may be more trouble for Rangers after the Calum Spence lineman had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the side of the team's supporters who played abroad.
Gerrard made eight changes to Ayr's side for the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and would have been happy with the way his well-trained form hindered their opponents continuously.
Rangers may have dominated possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They had to score just two minutes from the start when Menga's first-time lay-off sent Scott Pittman to an Allan McGregor goal but the midfielder took his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs's powerful free-kick then found skipper Craig Halkett but his partner defender Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot from behind.
Rangers gained control but there seemed to be more hope than belief about their game in the third final.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos felt he was to have a penalty on the fifteen-minute mark as he and Steven Lawless collided but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's appeals.
Rangers managed to score well only two shots in the first half of the match but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely worried him with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's mild strike.
While Livi's first goal in the 34th minute could have been when the other team was playing better, no one can deny that they deserved it just for their effort.
Once again, Rangers failed to manage a good set-piece of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher shoots the ball to Scott Robinson, who has kept calm to choose Menga to end the action.
Gerrard reacted in the brake by switching Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the change almost provided an immediate impact as the winger shoots at Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston went on to attract visitors to play just the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett catching a ball long after a long ball.
Holt's side were able to extend their lead position in the final stages but McGregor held tight to deny Jacobs before Lithgow went into the open from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty as he argued with Jacobs but again Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The Inventor of Geiger's Contact
And now a page from our Almanac of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, as today's 136 years ago today, and WE ARE TOO ... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Connector.
Science foundation Since then, Geiger's Connection has become a foundation of pop culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," featuring those unlikely cowboys scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
A man asks, "Is this the Madoff?"
Rogers: "That Geiger Contactor, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these cuffs, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms giving radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "I'm sure it's popular now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he turned 63.
However, the invention of the name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behavior
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behavior and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behavior as part of the treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, which are transformed into a laboratory.
They can then "see" a protein common to many cancers and then re-inject it
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behavior, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting the immune cells from a patient, they are changed in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and how they are "taught" how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West made a Verbal Attack in favor of Trump, while he was wearing a MAGA Beretta, Following his Appearance on SNL.
That's not a good mar
Kanye West was kicked out of the studio on Saturday Night Live after a performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town in which he was wearing a Great American beret, he began to speak out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to a white person and say, 'How can you please Trump, that's racist?'
If I were concerned about racism, I would have left America," he said.
SNL began the program with a comedy sketch featuring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judicial Committee about sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although he did not broadcast, West's video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock you West when he posted it.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that they had caught up with him after the scene about his beret.
"I've been behind the scenes.
He said, "Don't go out there with that bartender."
I'm pissed off!
Then they say it's lost," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the lost? and he went on to say that he would "wear my superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love."
His comments triggered a shooting at least twice by the audience and SNL cast members appeared embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "In the whole studio a great silence fell."
West brought him in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West concocted many with the performance of the song I Love It, dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West had support from the chairman of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR STAYING TO THE COLLEGE."
But presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply "what he is and this is a hugely beautiful thing."
"But I didn't choose to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') who I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It is free.
It's so much more," she added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "what was previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The previous rapper, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and of course the legend of music that is no longer with us Prince, changed his name to symbol then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder over knife-wielding in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with murder after a man was given knife wounds at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Magistrates' Court of Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington talks about toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, spoke about the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such on-screen roles mean that boys often feel they have to be violent to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something went wrong" and had doubts about how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old co-star of Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, has admitted he has "strong interests" to address the issue.
"Personally, I feel like I have a strong interest, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What were we teaching men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we have now?"
Kit believes television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through its highly male characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes young men feel that they want to be this certain side of a man?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change this?
For it is very clear that something has gone wrong for the young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he will not make Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, saying that "so many wars and horses".
From November Kit will appear in Sam Shepard's new True West production which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that when he met his wife Rose it was the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this program, so in this way she gave me my future family, and my life from now on," he said.
Rose interpreted the part of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series she won at Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on land owned by Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV was rapidly spreading in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people taking HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most disease transmissions come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member disclosed data of GOP senators, saying "dangerous lies" and "conspiring theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat ascertained that the claims were being spread by pundits and websites of the "ultra right-hand side".
"Lies, lies and more vile lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released allegedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure was made sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and released the information of a Waters staff member, reported the Hill.
"This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This baseless allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"It's a sign of anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
It should not be resistant.
It should not question the motives of the accused.
It should be calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who was accused by critics of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will run for Waters' seat in the mid-term elections, also made his voice heard on Twitter.
"This is great if it's true," he said on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate law enforcement authorities and bodies about these fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally accountable for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to each and all members of my staff."
Criticism of Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson, an imitation of a powerless spy
It has become traditional now to search for Brexit meanings in any new film with a British perspective and this seems applicable to the return of Johnny English's action-comedy imitation franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is the irony of autosatira on the subject of how obviously we are wrong, would it be the opportunity of a new export of the country?
At any rate, the incompetent Johnny English with big eyes and unusually moving parts had the license renewed for the second time to do everything wrong - that name more than anything shows it is a widespread comic creation designed for territories of non-English-speaking cinemagoers.
Of course it is the stupid secret agent who despite his strange claims to his cute fascination has a bit of Clouseau, a hit of Mr. Bean and a large part of that man who contributed one note to the melody of the theme of the Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in London.
It is also originally based on the traveller and international man of mystery that Atkinson once played his part in Barclaycard TV's adverts, today forgotten, after leaving chaos behind.
There's a nice moment or two in this last issue of JE.
I loved the moment when Johnny English was approaching a helicopter while he was wearing medieval armored clothing and the blades of propellers stuck to his helmet for a little while.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy is seen, but humor feels rather poor and oddly overdone, especially since the film's "serious" brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves offer comedy as an ingredient in a confident way.
Humor feels as if it's aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's bizarre mishaps were not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's unspoken film jokes in Bean's persona.
The perennial topical proposition now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated Britain's highly secret web network of spies, exposing the identities of all of Britain's agents in the field, to the disappointment of the agent who was at work - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the cherry on the cake for the prime minister who is an imperial figure with difficulties, already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this character like Theresa May but there is not much in the script to work.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone retired.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in an elegant building, but gives unofficial lessons on how to become an infiltrated operative: a little joke here as English offers a school of Rock-type spiking academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for emergency meetings and joins his former very patient partner, Bough, interpreted again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, with a submarine commander, a role of a olfactory one interpreted by Vicki Pepperdine, in which she is little wasted.
Therefore the two inseparable who always confuse everything in the Secret Service of her Majesty, are back in action, when they encounter the character of a seductive and beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the rule of the sweet technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of farceful behavior: dressed as waiters, setting fire to a high French restaurant, creating chaos to climb onto Volta's luxury yacht; and English begins a complete anarchy as he attempts to use Virtual Reality cuffs to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home.
Certainly all stops lead to that last sequence, but as friendly and animated as he is, he has little idea of a children's television.
It's something quite moderate.
And like Johnny English's other films I couldn't help thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that he really deserves for his talent?
Labour denies it is preparing a plan for Britons to work a four-day week but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that will see Britons work a four-day week - but are paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the company's teacher to hand over the remnants made from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by giving them another day's worth.
This would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but still taking with them the same pay.
Sources said the idea would be "fit" with the party's economic agenda and plans that the country leans in favour of workers.
The switch to a four-day week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"This will not happen from today to tomorrow but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits with the party's approach to rebalancing the worker-friendly economy as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the aspiration is currently not being approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "anonymous directors" and "those who profit" in utility firms.
The opposition chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take back their entire share as Labour's government may make "reductions" based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to give 10 percent of private sector firms' equity to employees, who are willing to take annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by a week, raising the question of whether the bureau's findings could influence any Republican senator from withdrawing his support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Sure, and sure," said Kennedy.
"I went to the court, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after that allegation was made, I said, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, inequilibrium."
However, Graham's vote, seems difficult to change.
"I've already decided about Brett Kavanaugh and it must be a very big indictment," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And any person who mentions it can't verify it.
It is 36 years old.
I didn't see anything new change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done something to reduce poverty?
Next Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a very impressive list of stars to be seen and an equally impressive mission; ending world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn of Central Park to not only enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the true purpose of the event ending extreme poverty by 20.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a representation group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or some other significant ways to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been with the remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade people to ask for a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called "clusterism" - people feeling like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
As of 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, insisting on a number of different goals.
It says these actions have helped urge world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that safe funds have so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people around the glare.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," with the promise of providing Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to invite the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website asking "what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It's going to be a long and hard journey - sometimes we're going to fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed, because we have more power when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among some of the artists who will appear at this year's event in New York, featuring Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Navy to use 'blockade' to curb Russian energy exports - Internal Secretariat
"If necessary", Washington could turn to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East, revealed US Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's growth in Syria - especially, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern side of Europe," he reportedly said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of dealing with this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to make sure that the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to block, to make sure that their energy has not reached the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees of the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that styles itself as the "power consumer voice" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches in addressing Russia and Iran, noting that these are effectively the same.
"The economic choice over Iran and Russia is, more or less, the leverage and substitution of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "someone with one skill" with an economy dependent on carbon fuels.
The claims come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas project, which according to Trump, has made Berlin the "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is expected to double the existing gas capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's intense opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading organisation for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from Europe's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will 'Examining Well' If You Run for President in 2020, Says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, Saturday said she will "well examine" whether to stand for president after the midterm elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider going out.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes a woman in the highest position," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will examine whether I am going to stand for president."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the council meeting, saying that he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was direct in her criticism of Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, a poll released Thursday, showed that a majority of Waren's own constituents do not think she should stand for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts "probable" voters said the senator should not stand for election, according to polls by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Center.
Thirty-two percent supported the issue for the election.
The poll showed more support for the exit for the election than former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting an exit for the potential election and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in relation to a potential exit to the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin refers to Track Palin's PTSD in Donald Trump's Manifesto
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being recorded in September
He was arrested and brought forward on a domestic violence incident on Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he returned, I can relate to other families who feel the ramifications of PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience in a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the obvious problem that no one is addressing" and said of her son and other veterans of the war, "they return a little differently, they return stronger, they want to think whether there is that respect for what other soldiers like them and air personnel, and every other member of the military, have given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was brought forward over a domestic violence attack on a woman, referring to a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district, Friday filed a case of a court friend in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The actor's full name in Grace's case against Sessions brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and the boy children members of his violent gang," abused her but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
It was held in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, as nations are facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Friday, in a statement, Columbia District Attorney Karl Racine, said the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum claims to be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a plea violates this principle, said the case of a friend of the court.
Lawyers continued to argue in the case that the policy of denying immigrants income harms the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in fight time to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become increasingly dire.
"It feels very intense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who was hugging her febrile baby at an evacuation centre in the unfortunate city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents appeared to return to their destroyed homes, searching for their water-soaked belongings, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, destroyed by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dawi Haris, who suffered back and shoulder fractures, remained outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to ongoing strong shocks.
His eyes filled with tears as he recounted how he felt the violent earthquake move the floor of the hotel on the fifth floor he was using with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have a chance to save ourselves.
I crashed with the remains of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in place for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and her family.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper issued a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper trying to sell the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid supplement to the Des Moines Register - the newspaper sold mostly in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war that has seen them pass rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion page in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling this bullying by making propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In spreading his propaganda, the government of China is using America's cherished tradition of free expression and the free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, on the down-the-road newspaper stand here in Beijing, you will find limited voices of dissemination and you won't see a true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China's problematic economic trajectory, since the media is found under Chinese Communist Party restriction," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Are Distracting Women Voters Before Mid-Term Elections with Kavanaugh Debate, Analysts Warn
As many Republicans of the top are backing and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while facing various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see an adverse reaction, particularly during the next midterm elections.
Emotions about this were very high, and most Republicans are already officially showing that they wanted to run by vote.
These things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School to The Hill for an article that was published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, protesters sang "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate hall as the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to run with Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst to the news site.
"People are saying they're already high; and it's true.
"But they can be higher, particularly between female voters switching votes in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who while disliked by the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested she could pursue an adverse reaction if Republicans lead with confirmation.
"This has become a complete mix-up for the GOP," said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote on whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about the way Republicans handled this situation and how they handled it," pointed out news station Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somehow divided over who to believe in view of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with little more support for the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed definitely or probably Ford's statement, while 35 percent said they believed definitely or probably Ford's statement.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his statement, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the push by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations put forward by Ford as well as at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh while drunk attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while at a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to compete against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, will launch a new business seeking to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company building on Berners-Lee's solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the new business.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, lists of what to do, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and all at the same time.
What makes the online personal data shop unique is that it is entirely up to the user to access what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal autonomy through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring appropriate resources, process skills and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform brought by IBM, some developers in staff who have a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized applications through the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they should introduce a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down from today to tomorrow.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established a World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic for this next web era," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the Clergy of the Victoria Cross of the First World War
The Church of England's only cleric who won Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his village 100 years later.
The Lt Kur The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honor.
Saturday was unveiled a commemorative stone by his two grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was to be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's prize-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt Kur led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a lot of fog and fire from guns on site and machine guns."
He later rushed to the line of fire and with "greatest courage" led the line forward before going for a rifle on the spot alone and unconsciously lost three of the troops.
The Lt Kur was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never get there but something very humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a wreath behind the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured to have played a role in this parade" and added "the courage of a genuine hero was being shown by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA supporters stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead finishing with Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you've stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 packed to end up deprived of seeing the main event.
The list from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and were being shown live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK remained stunned when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they had remained awake until the early hours especially for the fight.
One Twitter fan described the change to the children's card as "some kind of crude joke."
"It is a government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate so they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Papa the pig," yes.
Belator president Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, we can probably fix something," said Coker.
"But right now it's six o'clock in the morning and we won't be able to arrange until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we are working on it.
When it came time to post, there were a lot of messages and not all of them were good.
We were trying to fix the solution, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was not, it was a governmental issue.
I can assure you that the next one won't happen.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and have tried to bring more to the supporters and instead we went too far.
It is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" due to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he has grown to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but this has given him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent he cared less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as a setter on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" others growing up because "it was socially unacceptable to like you boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those emotions that you feel less than, and feel different, have been the true things that have given me the power and strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that it was "something", he said, not to disappoint everyone when they eventually find out about his sexuality.
The twice-time Olympic bronze medallist became a high-profile promoter for LGBT and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt fortunate to be able to live freely without reproach and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world winner said that when he became a lover of a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "she was a surprise" to him.
Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years his senior, last year but said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so many things at such a young age - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had had similar beautiful and horrible experiences.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "whole view" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, the important thing for me was 'I want to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die and one of the things he had asked for was if they already had tickets for London 2012 - since he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, p<0xC3><0xA0>," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized it wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a crowd of countries at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired the first selection of his song - Proud of Heather Small - that was compatible with him on the way to the Olympics and still catch the cold.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson who is no longer in shape stays on the bench in the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will make a record Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to change his shape to avoid being a less than happy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for a 12-time record, remained on the bench by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being the centre of the action, as was often the case for the United States, the big five-time winner shared his day between supporting and working on his game from a distance in the hope of rectifying his worries.
One who would never give the ball right even in the fullness of his career, the 48-year-old man is not ideal for the difficult course of Le Golf National, where the long distance racked up time after time punishing wrong shots.
And if the course on its own isn't daunting enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth game, faces the precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood, new to the season, to win all four of their matches this week.
If Americans, with four points less than the start of the 12 single games, start well, Mickelson's game can prove to be a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he played today, taping on my back and putting his arm around me and saying he will be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't get to play two games.
I've seen more, but this is how it worked and this is how we thought it would go.
He has to be outside, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has quite never reached the miles of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brought a few intangibles to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, humorous, likes to rub off on people, and a very good man to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players took pleasure in criticizing him, this week, which was something fun to see.
It provides a lot more than just games."
European captain Thomas Bjorn says the big position at the front could disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a sizeable lead position ahead of the last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros retained a five-point lead over the Americans but ended with a pitch with a true narrow margin, with a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 win.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead position in Valderrama; we had a great lead position in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a little bit," said Bjorn, in the press, after seeing the 2018 National Class win 5-3 in both Friday and yesterday to be on the cusp of being asleep.
So the story will show me and everyone in this team who has not yet finished everything.
Tomorrow you'll go with your soul and your body.
Get out there and do all the right things.
It's not over until the points have been made on the team.
We have a goal, and what he is trying to achieve is to win this trophy, and the focus is to stay there.
I've always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well what the other side is - the biggest players in the world."
Satisfied with how his players played on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I never go a step oltr<0xC3><0xA8> from me in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow concerns the individual performances we see, and this is something different to do.
It's very nice to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there individually, then you'll be tested for your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you want to convey to the players, which will bring out your best tomorrow.
Now, let the partner follow you and he wants to go out and get his best, too."
In contrast to Bjorn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to play better individually than when they did as partners, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who earned three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those last days that could change everything, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended up a loser as Europe made the "Miracle of Medinah."
"I remember at least a word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, prepared his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you want to get to that start as quickly as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw it in Medina.
When that momentum comes to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle parties.
We've tailored our list accordingly and put those men in the way we felt, you know, we're trying to do a few miracles tomorrow."
Thomas had been given the task of trying to lead the fight back and face Roy McIlroy in the best game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of men in this way because I think it covers the whole way," Bjorn said of his singles choices.
Germany's new war has been postponed once again
The German Navy's newest frigate was to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era frigates, but will not be there until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the flagship of the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a spokesman for the military.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but the problematic post-delivery issues have tarnished the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships ordered by the Navy back in 2007 will come as a replacement for the ageing Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, an exhibition of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some precautionary technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signalling.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - this should be possible to operate the newest ferries up to two years away from home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that ships of the latest technology - which allow Germany to project power offshore - will already be obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared in the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after it delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for this, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that made the ship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
The flaws in the software were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessel will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the workers on the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it appeared that the vessel is well overweight which would reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add future updates.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons is understood to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
This is said to have reached a shocking amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - from an initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of the newest frigates become especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy currently "has a lack of ships to withstand deployment."
The official said that the problem has grown over time, because old vessels have been commissioned but replacement vessels have not been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is mentioned on the secret life of bats
New research being carried out on land in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape when searching for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of single flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common pipistrelles and soprano as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
An expert analysis of the sounds of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of bat calls and what species are doing what.
A habitat map and a report will then be produced that will create a detailed picture of their behavioural landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of pastures and how best to maintain woodlands for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and around the UK has declined considerably over the past century.
They are under threat from construction and development work affecting nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can poison papers to trap insects and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are not actually blind.
However, because of their notoriety hunting traditions their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated ecolocality technique to indicate insects and obstacles in their path when flying.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at Threave land in Dumfries and Galloway, welcoming eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a very good area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is much more about bats that is not yet known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
It stresses the importance of checking bats for maintenance in properties as it is possible that unintentional destruction of a single maternity nest can kill up to 400 women and young, possibly destroying an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass or harass them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer for the Night Butterfly Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we still don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as lawyers are ready to search for German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has cited rape claims against him as "fake news," saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are expected to court-martial German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he had then paid her $375,000 not to say anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking on a video on Instagram Live with his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, remarked the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," said Ballon d'Or's winner five times while looking in the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It is normal.
They must become famous to say my name, but this is part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is going well," the player added, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player seeks compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident was said to have taken place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her by the anus, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" "a good man" disappointed with the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sexual intercourse, but that this was by consensus.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and taken photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "wrapped by retaliation" and was worried that she would "be humiliated publicly."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to reverse the solution as she is still being traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and this summer he walked with Italian football legend Juventus in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'regrets forever' that it has lost car manufacturers
The UK "regrets forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Mr Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Auris and Avensis of Toyota - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a stop in production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line today operates on an "exact on time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for customised cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be border disruptions that industry says could lead to delays and parts shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep a day-long inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Mr Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid these border controls."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that allows, as I say, not just success to be enjoyed at the moment but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we need to absolutely be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say for how long production would be halted, but in a longer period, it warned that increased costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the host of the Unite union at the plant, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience when these jobs leave, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's risky meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could "be delayed by another week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's aid and Russia and a potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will expel the deputy attorney general or not, endangering Mueller's independence, instigating Washington's rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
However, he went to the White House on Monday, despite reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, which was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather not" dismiss Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid a misunderstanding with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh over a period of one week, which delayed further full Senate voting.
On Sunday, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "A date has not yet been set for this, it could happen this week, and it could happen the following week because of all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But now we see and I always like to keep the picture up-to-date".
Some journalists dispute this claim: Sanders has been holding a press meeting at the White House since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of meetings was not due to a lack of grace with TV journalists "trying to attract and influence the audience", although she said: "Although I agree with the fact that they try to attract and influence the audience."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president does more Question and Answer sessions compared to any president who has been there before him," she added without citing any evidence: "We look at those numbers."
Meetings will still continue to be held, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask questions to the president of the United States directly, this is far better than talking to me.
We try to do this a lot and we've seen it do it many times in the last few weeks and this will replace the press meeting where one can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump rarely answers questions when leaving the White House or when participating in open sessions or press conferences when visiting dignitaries.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he behaved relaxed and sometimes strangely in front of groups of journalists.
Health secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit-related fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and desire that they remain there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months left for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to defray the cost of defined status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continued, moving towards decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also been stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is definitely an uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to support now the extent to which I value the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the functioning of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would very much like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie performs emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers' linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury Saturday when his team lost against the Vanderbilt Commodores by 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the halftime.
"He went over the sideline and like he fell there," said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff donated oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him to the rear for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was no longer being operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "so far there is no detail about the type/extent of the injury" and the State of Tennessee is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in the university's second year suspended, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after leaving Illinois.
Saturday in total he had five tackles before leaving the game, leading to a total of 18 tackles of his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp duty when buying property in the UK with extra money used to help the homeless under new Tory plans
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The tax increase will be imposed on those who are not paying tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects it to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the homeless
Today Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers should pay a higher stamp duty rate when buying property in the UK - with the extra money used to help the homeless.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high-wage earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and firms that do not pay tax in the UK, with the extra money boosting the Government's efforts to combat sleep on the streets.
The additional fee - which is additional to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and rental purpose purchases - could be three percent.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which is increasing prices and making it harder for new buyers to make the first step in the housing purchase phases.
Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "fantasy cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending much of their time abroad.
The new policy came out just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a stamp duty cut to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by seizing land and not using it, and urged Mrs. May to abandon allowances on affordable housing in order to remedy the "shameful housing situation" in the UK.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed housing reforms striking the eye, including controls on rent and an end to "no fault" evictions.
He also wants to give councils great powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my position to restoring the UK's dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
This means that we are in the process of renovating our housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies find it as easy to buy homes as the busy UK residents.
For many people the dream of having a home has become too remote, and the indignity of sleeping on the streets remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland head Jack Ross says his "fundamental ambition" is to one day become Scotland's manager.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is taking up the challenge of reviving the North East club, which is currently in third place in League One, with three points different from that in first place.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and nothing more," Ross told the BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But when I was a child, I often went with my father to see Scotland play in Hampden, and this is always the thing that drew me back.
However, this opportunity comes only if we succeed in managing a club."
Former Ross as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says that he did not worry about the fact that he would follow such established names into a club so large, while previously refusing the offer from Barnsley City and Ipswich.
"Right now, the success for me will be based on 'can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'"
Due to the structure and facilities of this club there is no doubt that this club belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy thing to get there, but I probably think I've succeeded here only if I manage to take the club back there."
Ross has only been three years in his career as manager, after a tenure of assistant chief at Dumbarton and having spent 15 months with Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third category, transforming St Mirren from the relegation edge to a Championship title winner the following season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he did during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
As for when he took Alloa over, he recalled that "It was probably a big change."
"I really thought that the position of manager was the most suitable one for me, much more than that of a player.
This may sound strange because I was going well, I had a decent living, and I enjoyed some reasonable gains.
However, playing games can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still experience this in terms of stress and work pressure but I just feel that the position of manager is suitable for me.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I feel that throughout my adult life I'm now feeling the most comfortable."

A survey found that the best time to take a pint of beer is at 5.30pm
The summer heat wave has boosted the earnings of Britain's struggling pubs but put more pressure on the company's restaurants.
In July, groups of pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales - but figures revealed that restaurant profits fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA's business advisory, who compiled the figures, said: "Continuous Suns and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pub sales increased by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even more.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June further worsened in July.
The pubs and bars whose main sales are drinks were the ones that mostly performed well in terms of financial results compared to the previous period while restaurant sales declined.
The pubs whose main sales are food also suffered in the heat, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the pubs and bars managed beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent for the month, while food dropped to three percent."
Paul Newman, one of RSM's analysts regarding entertainment and hospitality said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors in terms of take-aways market sales.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent year-on-year will be particularly burdensome in addition to the ongoing cost pressures.
Warm and long summers could not come at a worse time for operators whose main sale is food and only time can advise us on whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide much needed rest."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including the opening of new businesses, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the launch of new businesses.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitoring for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined revenues of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the industry's established benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts hidden from their parents.
A survey reveals that one in five children - some as young as 11 years old - have secret social media accounts hidden from their parents and teachers.
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "False Insta" pages
The news has great fears that sexual content is being postulated
Twenty percent of students said they had a "key" account to show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 years old - are creating social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in "Insta fake" accounts - a reference to the site for sharing Instagram photos.
The news has great fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a presentable "main" account to show to their parents, while having private others.
A mother who met the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a young woman who was urging others to rape her - "steal me."
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to keeping private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that many young people are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will become the "voice for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most track and non-track athlete to have won medals the most and president Ian Beattie described this change as a great opportunity for sport leaders to benefit from her vast experience at an international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by becoming part of the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am looking forward to acting as a voice for athletes and I hope to be able to truly contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta among his total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a regular critic of the BBC, ended up not walking after suffering a minor stroke.
On Twitter, he wrote: "Today, I'm having a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time can give us advice on whether or not to recover or to what extent.
It was a hard job but I recovered completely, I learned how to breathe again and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
A breast pump ad that compares mothers to cows gives rise to different opinions online
A breast pump company has given rise to different online opinions with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to lactating cows.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered to be "the world's first wearable, non-noiseable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released an advertisement inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers using the pump.
Four real mothers dance in a matura filled with cow straw with a disc that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I'm beating myself up but I don't have a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed these aren't nipples but breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pump out, pump out, I'm feeding my babies, pump out, pump out, I'm milking my wives."
However, the ad that was published on the company's Facebook page, caused online controversy.
With 77,000 spectators and hundreds of comments, the video received different reactions from viewers, many of whom say it sheds light on the "terror" of the dairy industry.
Someone wrote "It was a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except that their babies are taken to them within a few days of giving birth".

Someone else commented: "One understands that this is a traumatic thing for both the mother and the baby.
But why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "An advertisement really detached from reality."
Others defended the ad, with a woman admitting she found the disc "very entertaining."
"I think this is a generic idea.
If I'd have bought one, I'd have bought one.
It made me feel the same way as a cow.
It's a bit of a clich<0xC3><0xA9>, but I've got it covered.
This is a generic product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at moms who pump (often on their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like 'cows'.
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video the group of women reveal that they were all dancing with the non-perishable pumps in the eye placed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump, makes no noise, has no wire or tube and sits in a lactation bra without giving in to the eye, thus giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even come out while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing the women who use the breast pump to the dairy cows we wanted to focus on breast pumping and all the challenges it brings, while showing in a fun and relatable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has appeared on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Walk Speechless to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply despite monthly border crossings remaining largely unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder for children to be placed with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and feared that if they came forward to care for a child they would endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their poultry would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or sponsors' household members are here in the country illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
So we are continuing to look for these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to speed up the process involving children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to Shelter workers.
Many will appear through a video teleconference, rather than in person, in order to bring arguments in favour of their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for aid will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the more children are held in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or distressed, which can lead to them expressing themselves violently or trying to escape.
Lawyers have said that this concern increases in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where it is more likely to ignore signs that a child is finding it difficult, due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or without saying health to their friends could lead to trauma many of which are already struggling.
Syria tells "occupying forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's war now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces have been on Syrian territory illegally, with the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be addressed accordingly."
"They should withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we expel from all Syrian territories" both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, many of whom train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-ravaged country.
Regarding the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions were right for them to return, and blamed "in some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that led refugees to keep away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last powerful major rebellion has created an opportunity to keep political talks going.
The deal between Russia and Turkey averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where 3 million people live.
However Moualem stressed that the deal had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be restricted "to the revision of articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Trump will win the second term
With this logic, in 2020 Mr. Trump will win re-election as long as, as many liberal viewers are hoping, the denunciation and scandal will end his presidency prematurely.
This is without a doubt "the most dramatic finale ever held in a presidency!"
So far, it seems that the viewers are still not satisfied.
Since 2014, time ratings with the largest number of viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the time with the highest number of viewers, over 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has increased cable television ratings with even 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is a situation that is attracting people to it because it is not something we understand," said Neal Baer, a presenter of the ABC drama program "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary becoming president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Why bother me,'" said Mrs. Scovell.
In this case, there is an entertainment value.
Undoubtedly, unlike anything else on TV, the story titles that emerge from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring what is happening around you is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, this goes beyond the fact of being an informed citizen when at six you find yourself following a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep-rooted" sourcing for his book "Fear," the bomb jacket with the skin of an ostrich ("a proud reflecting outfit," said The Washington Post) of Paul Manafort's $15,000 worth of "The Washington Post."
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"Part of what he's doing to make it as if this is a reality show is that every night he's leading you something," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about the changing cast and development in Trump's daily plot (fight with the N.F.
You can't afford to miss a single episode because otherwise you'll fall behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his house the weather was sunny with a temperature of 80 degrees on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not be detached from television, not when there was Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
"I remember when before we were doing those extravagance programs and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr Fleiss said.
"I thought it was a joke, but in truth they were right."

Large amounts of cash arriving from abroad for the tightest races in the White House mid-term election
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's seventeen congressional districts are seeing a large amount of money, thanks to a realignment of congressional districts that have acquired two operators in a race for the same seat.
This recently re-established the pits of Pittsburgh's suburban district Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is standing as a candidate against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's twelfth old district, extending far above the new seventeenth district.
The maps were re-established after in January the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally rigged in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new seventeenth district provoked a difficult financial campaign contest between the arms of the main party's finances, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) (Congress Committee of the Democratic Campaign) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC)
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning with little difference in the March special election followed widely for the eighteenth Pennsylvania Congressional District.
That seat has been Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the district by 20 points.
Political critics have given the Democrats a small advantage.
The U.S. Considered Punishing El Salvador For Supporting China, Then Decided Not to Do It
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little help from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a welcoming meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and held a hotel in Panama until some partners fired the Trump Organization's administrative team.
State Department officials decided to re-contact American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement at the beginning of this month.
But the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in U.S. aid, including narcotics controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been burdensome for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings began to progress, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials of the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with the aim of effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence was strongly criticised for addressing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration places on the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned quietly back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new and harsh message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman, Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the anonymity condition.
Their reports were supported by a foreign analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
A Study of History
The next unexpected negative event could be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, about which there is now very substantial evidence in the public register.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign was agreed with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In the event that Congress passes on to another person, Mr. Trump will find himself responsible in that body, as he prepares himself to go before voters again, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
This involves a lot of uncertainties, and I don't aim to suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the lengthening of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup d'<0xC3><0xA9>tat against Hitler, which would have been resisted by the West and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We did not succeed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Today, Americans face many of these inflection points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump expels Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this document reported that, last year, he suggested for the president to be secretly recorded and speculated that he is unsuitable for the post.
Mr Rosenstein said The Times's report was inaccurate.
"How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh's new requested F.B.I. investigation is incomplete or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual behavior and dishonest testimony?
And above all, in the middle of the terms we will vote for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, it will take some time for democracy to shift.
But I don't think I'm going to fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the home of my ambassadors.
She managed to live, immigrating to America and, 60 years later, on the day of worship God sent me to light the candles on that swastika table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of the competitive game with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the win against the Austrians, after the impressive equal result they brought in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season becoming a 2-2 equal result with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a catalyst for big things.
"This was a good point for us as Villarreal are a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We got into the game with the belief that we could get something and we came up with a point.
We probably won it in the end but, overall, a level playing field was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half of the game while we went better in the second half.
It's going to be a big European night again.
We hope to be able to get three points but this will be difficult because they have had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I am sure we can continue to do our best and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but at the moment there is a sense of positivity.
The team is good and the boys are having a lot of fun; the training is being good.
I hope that now we can do our best, forget the last season and succeed."
Women are concerned about the risks associated with retirement.
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wished to be cared for, few people were talking to their family members about this.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want to be a caring family member, but they are not taking the steps to have a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance business.
You should start that.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't express your wishes well ahead of time.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive treatment, as those options can be a significant factor in determining cost.
Get your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a life insurance policy with a hybrid money value to help cover these costs or make self-insurance with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Make a decision after discussing your legal documents in the long term: Avoid legal battles.
Find a healthcare attorney to select a reliable individual to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
In addition, consider a proxy for your finances.
Choose a person you trust to make financial decisions for you and make sure your accounts are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the financials that are involved, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Let's see if that plan is ready."
A man has been hit several times by air rifle shots in IIfracombe
A man was hit several times by gunshots from an air rifle as he was walking home after an evening out.
The victim, aged over 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of IIfracombe, Devon, when he was hit by shots in his chest, abdomen and hands.
Officials described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries do not pose a threat to his life and police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by an earthquake and a powerful tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communication lines damaged, aid officials were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, which is an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, about the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central province of Sulawesi, located at the edge of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit the city, it was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of the coast northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, an administrative region under a province, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the economy of the Central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mine is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast of the other side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also hit the western side of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Ring of Fire of the seismic Pacific and is often hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of Mentawai's islands, off Sumatra, triggering a 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A low earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 were killed due to collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the island's upper side.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he grabbed the phone from her hand.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself "certainly, not guilty" when asked to give his plea, the network reported.
Palin is facing three Class A crimes, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and have to pay a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B offence, which is punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the domestic violence crime report, and possessing a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend has alleged that she was hit in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after a comparison was made between her son's violent behavior and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not working with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the centre of Sulawesi located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Media are circulating videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore with great force.
Federal prosecutors are demanding that the NYC terrorist attack suspect be given a rare death penalty
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding that Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, be given the death penalty - a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a road bike attack along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, flying pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intent to request the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, these two heads of indictment carry with them a possible death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed Saipov 22 heads of charge which included eight charges of murder with the help of an organized retaliatory, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
When describing the way in which Saipov carried out this "brutal, cruel and immoral" attack, prosecutors said that the attack required "substantial pre-planning and meditation."
The notice of intent states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Mendoza".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally given a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being found guilty of conspiracy to carry out an espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were killed by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he inspired himself to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the head of the charge.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of the charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are "certainly disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea for life in prison with no possibility of release will only continue to prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
MP Tory says Nigel Farage should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised that he would "mobilize the people's army" .
The former head of the Ukip said politicians had to "feel pressured" by Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party government member Peter Bone told the Birmingham demonstration that the UK "would have come out" so far if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But Mrs May's challenge to reconcile her deeply divided positions has been highlighted by Tories, who is not in favour of Brexit and has joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks by Brexiteers, anti-Brexiters and the EU.
The allies insisted that despite the negative reaction she would continue to move forward to try to reach an agreement with Brussels - forcing Eurosceptics and the Labour party to choose between her package and the "chaos".
Mr Bone told the rally Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "remove the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been given a high social position and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have been out by now," he said.
MP Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit but we need to abandon the Chequers plan."
When he declared that he is against the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We have to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and must remain absolutely untrue."
Andrea Jenkyns, Tory's Brexiteers, was also present for the demonstration, telling reporters: "I want to say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the Opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and with our activists who are in fact the ones who go to the streets and who first of all vote for us.
"Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please
In a message aimed at Mrs May, she said: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians should "feel pressured" that they would be going back on the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to get back out of Brexit and we are here today to tell them that 'we will not let you down if you do this.'"
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: "I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is at the point of going back from Brexit.
We are mobilising in Brexit the army of the people of this country that has brought us success and we will not spend until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud UK."
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit protesters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Following the group's launch this weekend, a small number of activists drew banners in Tories Against Brexit (Tories Against Brexit).
Lord Adonis, who holds a high social position in the Labour party, ridiculed the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with a party app as it opened the conference.
"These are the people who tell us they can have all the IT systems in place and technology for Canada and more, for the frictionless border, for borderless free trade in Ireland," he added.
"This is a full-blown.
The idea of a good Brexit does not exist," he added.
Warren intends to "carefully examine" the possibility of coming out for the presidential election
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections she will "carefully examine the possibility of coming out for the presidential election".
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the member of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about her future in a debate with citizens at municipal level in West Massachusetts.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will stand for re-election in November against GOP Representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She was at the center of speculation that she might replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents who have been using the format of debate with citizens at municipal level since Trump took office.
A person who attended the meeting asked her if she intended to stand for the presidential election.
Warren responded that it was time "for women to go to Washington to repair our fragmented government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrests were made in connection with the shooting of LSU Sims
Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect was arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims that took place Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET News Conference.
On Friday they released a video of the shooting, in which they asked for help in identifying the man seen in the video.
Sims, aged 20, was shot dead near the University of the South campus Friday morning.
According to 247sports, Saturday police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media "Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to his head and eventually died as a result."
Wayde came to defend his friend and was hit by a shot from Simpson.
Simpson was asked questions and admitted he was on the scene, that he had a weapon, and admitted to shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and kept in custody at the Eastern Parish Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims, a six-foot-tall youngster raised in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is set to win the world title after his team's orders gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Saturday, from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important part in the race.
From the position on the inside in the first row, Bottas had a good lead and almost abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter the stopping areas and allowed Hamilton to play with the others in the group's last place, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in the stop zone after another lap and exited just behind Vettel, but Hamilton continued to walk after a little wheel action with a wheel which led to the Ferrari driver leaving the inside out with difficulty due to the risk of giving up after a double move to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place until the end of the first lap at his birthday at the age of 21.
He then was in the lead for most of the race by not changing his tyres with the aim of quickly completing and jumping Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
Eventually he entered the stop zone at 44 laps but was unable to step up his pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen entered fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a very good job throughout the weekend and was a real gentleman saying let me by.
The team did a really exceptional job to get first and second place," said Hamilton.
That was a really bad physical attitude
President Donald Trump joked to Senator Dianne Feinstein in a rally on Saturday about her insistence that she did not reveal the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Judicial Committee Senate, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "vile and disgusting and dishonest."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see the people who are wet and vile and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and disclosures and then say 'no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you uncovered any information?
Remember her answer... unveiled the document - "e, e, what is it?
No you don't see.
I didn't reveal anything."
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
"No, we didn't," he added, while imitating the senator.
Feinstein you sent her the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and this was revealed earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the disclosure had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she requested."
But it seems that her rejection was not well received by the president, who at the Saturday evening rally commented: "You know what I know, that was a really bad physical attitude.
It may not have been the best experience I've ever had, but it's the best experience I've ever had."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three people, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their purposes.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You're seeing the vilitude, the disgust, they don't care who gets hurt, who gets sticks in the wheels to gain power and control," the president said according to reports from Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League defeat against Belfast Giants by winning the match against the same 5-3 opponent in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants gained a two-goal advantage early in the game with two attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the same score for the team playing in his country before Dwyer regained an advantage for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard earned the same score for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen confirmed their victory.
This was the third victory of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's players, who after several defeats advanced to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
It was the fourth time this season that both teams met, with Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer's first goal took place in the fourth minute at 3:35 with a pass from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford taking the pass while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a multi-action opening period, Sullivan brought the country's playing team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave a pass to Cownie at 15:16 which brought the same score for both teams.
Dwyer ensured that Giants gain an advantage until the first break of the game when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The team that is playing in his home country has rejoined and again thanks to Bouchard they reached the other team with a strong goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee a first-time advantage in the game at the end of the second period and secured a fifth-goal win for his team in the middle of the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies To Ensure Hundreds Of People On The Plane Can Escape The Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is seen as a hero after he died to make sure a plane carrying hundreds of people manages to land safely.
More than 800 people died and many were lost after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Heavy tremors continued to dominate the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save him, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the swinging control tower at Palu Airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained calm in order to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the time sitting in the runway, could safely leave.
He then jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was crashing.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's spokesman, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision likely saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News of Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan in order to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we had to leave this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"When we hear about this, we feel a great sadness," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is estimated that the number is still increasing because many bodies were still under the rubble while many could not be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached up to six meters, destroyed Palu, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance enters the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
"Mini-markets are being stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "Indonesia's Red Cross is working hard to help those who are still alive but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking all of you to work day and night to complete every task related to the evacuation.
Ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline, which was operating a crashed flight in the Pacific lagoon of Micronesia, now says a man is missing, after previously saying that the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, it was unable to give details about the whereabouts of one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water when it tried to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the incident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon just away from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overrun the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
"That's a really good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others managed to pass through the water that was high to their waists until the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and yelling, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to improve a pier also helped rescue by using an inflatable boat to carry passengers to shore before the plane sank at about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents in the past two decades but no incident involved Air Niugini.
An analyst presents a timeline of the evening in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday the prosecution concluded its evidence on the case in the new trial of a man who is accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile phone records to gather information about the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19, the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers that night that she died, contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the mobile phone data showed that he was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city at the time.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that night he was in the Sanford truck, Sanford said he was "lying, since my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they knew each other only a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, phone calls and contact information from his mobile phone.
"He erased it from his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to pass to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
Three hip hop artists want to challenge the negative perspective of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip hop has moved beyond its origins of political messages and is addressing social issues.
They want to go back to his roots and again make the hip hop conscious popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
A couple from New York have been charged with "disappearing" after a phone call.
Nanny from New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an error message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple denies being racist, and compares the case to an "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed regret when she learned that the new child-care provider, Giselle Maurice, was a dark carer when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"LEEEEEEEEEEE PERSONAL OTHER SEWDA," Ms Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After noticing her thick mistake, Plasco-Flaxman felt "uncomfortable" and fired Ms. Maurice, saying that her former African-American nanny had not done her job well and that instead she was waiting for a Filipina, according to the New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for her one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation in relation to the dismissal, and is seeking compensation of $350 per day for the six-month live-in position for which she had been initially employed, despite being without a contract.
I want to show them, listen, you can't do things like that," she told a Post Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple attacked the claims that they are racist, saying that Ms Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable thing they could do, fearing that they could not trust her after offending her.
"She sent me something that she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist people," Joel Plasco told Post.
"But would you trust your children into the hands of someone who spoke to you in bulk, even if it was by mistake?
Your child's birth?
and come on."
Comparing the case to "extortion", Plasco said that it had only been two months since his wife had had the baby and she was "in a very difficult situation".
"Are you going to accuse someone like that?"
It's not a good thing to do," added the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly announced the couple on social media, insulting them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born soon after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in someone's shoes reading it for the first time before it was published.
"It's really amusing to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children's book by a small gambling bear, would certainly have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "pleasant but somewhat overshadowed by the grief" after his death.
About Paddington, who she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was proud of his eventual success although he would never stop talking about it.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't full of himself," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who gets something: be proud of them even if it's not you who's got something.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success that way.
Although he was his creation and imagination, he always gave the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to give her the last greeting on the phone
As soon as she landed her daughter, she was taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors worked to save her life but it was all in vain.
"Nad was calling regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to live," said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a phone call from Nad to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to give her the final greeting.
And so I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were slowing down and leaving her system slow.
She had died a short time before, and it all started.
All I could do was sit back and wait, aware that all this is happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold back."
Eventually Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who has so far been crying for her daughter's loss, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - who were unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had a low head, and the tears began to fall all the time.
It's hard to explain, but there was on the flight that I felt a great sense of sympathy towards Nad.
He needed my love and respect.
I knew how much he loved her."
Post cards of distressed women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were attaching cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people could call for support.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis's son, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up every room."
However, he had to quit work before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had killed himself.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always afraid that this will be the cause of another ugly event."
Ms Davis created the cards, "to let people know that there are people you can open your heart to or meet, even if as a friend.
Don't sit in silence - you need to speak up."
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or so," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day it was very bad - when the children opened their gifts they didn't make any contact with them with his eyes or anything like that."
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but they want to fight her: "Leave a gap in the family.
It divides us.
But we all have to keep fighting and fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in a precarious situation as the FBI begins an investigation
"I said, if we could get something like what he asked for - a limited in time, limited in scope investigation - perhaps we would have brought some unity," Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "differing" among partisan paralysis that had taken root.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the choice of time.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans do not go well, in that case they will be severely weakened in their attempts to put the man they want elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was picking up the phone to call the Senators, to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through which he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the F.B.I. presents its report?
Voting will take place in the Senate, where they currently hold 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, the vice president, to vote and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea "declines" under Kim
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Citing data from the South Side unification ministry, Park Byeong-seug, said there were 1,127 party changes last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates demanded by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Many of them flee by passing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross compared to the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants instead of refugees and often forcibly sends them back home.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that were focused on stalling denuclearization negotiations.
This followed the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress made since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will in no way be the first to unilaterally disarm," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," while saying he is unable to work in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee Mr Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he is unable to work in the Supreme Court due to his temperamental behaviour.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had ever behaved that way, they would have said 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both still young.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even yelling and choking when talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in committee, calling the allegations against him "an assassination of the grotesque and coordinated character" organized by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, because it showed that he has prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way in which he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi stated when asked whether she would try to accuse Kavanaugh if confirmed, and whether the Democrats would gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say something -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not capable, not just to be in the Supreme Court, but even to be in the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Currently Kavanaugh is a judge at the D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would change certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not appropriate for a person with hysterical biases to go to court and expect us to say, 'Very well,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to exercise their authority.
It's a fair verbal attack, months and years full of anger, and she can't say what she has to say without crying.
"We're going to die," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, what do you say?"
She added, "She gave me a lot of a woman who was stuck somewhere else, who said that even she would cry when she was wet, but developed a technique that meant that when she was wet and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, 'You probably think you're upset because I'm crying.
I'm screwed."
And then it didn't stop.
And I thought it was a brilliant thing."
Crying is allowed as a way to unleash one's great anger in part because fundamentally they are misinterpreted.
One of my most vivid memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying with indescribable anger, was when an older woman grabbed me by the cocoon of my neck - a cold manager I was always afraid of - and carried me to the stairs.
"Don't let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're upset.
They think you're upset and they feel happy that they've managed to hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Democratic congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he would stand for the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-wedlock relationship on a boat known as Monkey Business and exited the election, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply uneasy, concluded that there was no reason why she would not explore the idea of dating herself for the presidential election.
"It wasn't a good decision," he said 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who were going to run for election, and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Nani."
As this was at the end of the campaign, she was lagging behind in fundraising, so she swore she would not stand for election if she did not make $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who were giving $1,000 to the men to whom she was giving only $250.
"Do they think I'm taking a discount?" she said.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so emotional - grateful to the people who supported her, outraged by the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and to target voters instead of delegates, and outraged at sexism - that it ensnared her.
"I probably thought I had a strong brake," Mrs. Schroeder reminded of the way the media reacted to her.
"I thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would you write on my grave?
"Did she cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The numbers of aerial bombs of the opening of the trade war between the United States and China were overwhelming you, and while the battle remains to end, a misunderstanding between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese exporters including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting goods amounting to $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing all goods entering the United States from China.
Beijing has retaliated every time in the same way, while more recently it has been presenting tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has vowed to agree with the United States every time, and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will give up in the near future.
The fact that Washington takes a step back means that it accepts the demands, but publicly the fact that China surrenders to the United States will be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing works wisely, U.S. trade war pressures could positively support China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for starting economic chaos in both countries is actually much more dangerous than what spectators have previously acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, research partners focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security (Center for New American Security), which is a think tank.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the start of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country.
Another 6 million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the sedition.
Europe's win over Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup against Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again won the title when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points it needed to win the United States.
Phil Mickelson who is prominent in the United States, who struggled throughout the entire tournament, gave his ti coup into the water in the 16th hole par-3, thus giving up his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all his rounds, becoming 1 out of 4 players who have ever brought 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against the lowest-level player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-level player, Dustin Johnson, brought in 2 and 1 for England's Ian Poulter who played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the best European tennis player ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I normally wouldn't cry but today I couldn't hold on.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas who chose me and who believed in me.
I am very happy, very happy that I got the cup back.
The team is everything, and I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot partner John Ram who won United States golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles play Sunday.
"The incredible pride that I feel, that I won for Tiger Woods, when I grew up following him," said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup record 13-21-3 throughout his career.
Strange statistics of one of the best players ever here, who won 14 main titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find those parts of the golf course with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high calibre golf throughout the entire tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his team, "I'm proud of these men, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
Arguments.
I'm going to give Thomas the thumbs up.
He's a very good captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We will re-join, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be a captain.
You'll have to grab the hat and tilt your head.
Play better than that."
