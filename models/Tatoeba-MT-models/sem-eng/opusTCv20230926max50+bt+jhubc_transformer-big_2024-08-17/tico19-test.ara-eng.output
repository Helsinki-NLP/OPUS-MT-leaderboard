Rapidly increasing cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative number of coronavirus (COVID-19) shows similar trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK, confirming that although the stage varies based on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness to increase the number of COVID-19 patients who will need health care, particularly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a range of pneumonia cases of unknown pathogens were reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent, the novel coronavirus, is now referred to as the coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that almost 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have mild illness; that is, they have respiratory infections with or without symptoms, and most of them recover.
In approximately 14%, COVID-19 has worsened into a more severe illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% suffer from a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients who stayed in hospital due to COVID-19 was about 4%.
In this study, we assess trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA (EU/EEA) and UK (UKA) country and compare them with those from Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After what happened in China, COVID-19 has increasingly spread geographically and follows the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance issue of 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed European COVID-19 cases according to the WHO definition of the case.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 for people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and this date, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative number and cumulative rate of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization, is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and compared to those in Italy.
As a measure of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative number of intermittent COVID-19 cases within 14 days, and then took into account the normal course of COVID-19, in all EU/EEA countries and the UK, between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases reported from each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m., compared to the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
Trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases across a 14-day period in EU/EEA countries and the UK followed those of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative number of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February, and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was often driven by a rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar growth trends to the cumulative number of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
As of 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom reported the total number of cases already similar to that found in Italy just 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 indicate that the pandemic is worsening at a similar pace in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, and despite different national public health responses, and the possibility of different state definitions in different countries and protocols to choose which patients should be tested for COVID-19, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected areas of Italy described a situation where almost 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospital admissions and/or intensive care units for COVID-19 cases at EU/EEA level are currently available for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data are not provided).
However, they need to be systematically collected to update existing observational data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010–11 study showed a large variation in the availability of intensive and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU and ICU beds per 100,000 people in 2010–11).
Modelling scenarios associated with satisfaction of healthcare capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital associated with a 90% risk of overcapacity of intensive care beds, are available in the sixth update of the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention rapid risk assessment for COVID-19.
Since the cases collected so far in certain regions of the EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve specific regional populations, it is preferable to provide information on the cases and intensive care beds at the level of designation of the regional units of statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in the EU/EEA and the UK.
States, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare themselves for the scenario of a sustainable community transition to SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of health care, particularly intensive care, such as that occurring in the affected areas of Italy.
As outlined in the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is key to delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2 with a shift from containment to mitigation, as the expected rapid increase in case numbers may not provide decision makers and hospitals with sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
A rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a limited chance that countries could step up their surveillance efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care.
If this fails, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to experience an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care over the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by SARS-CoV-2, the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has killed more than 3,000 people and injured more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian catastrophe.
SARS-CoV-2, similar to SARS-CoV-2, which infected thousands of people with SARS in 2003, can also move from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower risk and mortality rate than SARS but is more transmission and impactful among older people than young people and among men than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications related to the emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a comprehensive and timely review of the rapidly evolving topic of research.
We will address the basics of epidemic disease, its causes, its virology, diagnosis, treatment, disease progression prediction, and prevention.
Although many questions still need to be answered, we hope this review will help to understand and eliminate the threat of the disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 became an unprecedented and memorable anniversary for all Chinese who were urged to stay indoors for the duration of the holiday and for many weeks afterwards due to an outbreak of a novel viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (COV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, and its associated disease CoV-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country, as well as nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospitals and more than 3,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is the “number one public enemy” and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 researches have been published on COVID-19 that have included disease virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment, since the first report was released on January 7, 2020 that determined the sequence of the isolated virus through many patients.
This review aims to summarize research progress in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
Whenever possible, we will seek to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by Cove, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an outbreak that occurred in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far in terms of preventing and predicting the course of the disease as well as some pressing questions that are still on the table.
Coronaviruses are usually considered non-fatal pathogens in humans and have mainly caused about 15% of the common 4 common colds.
In this century, however, we have been confronted with two highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, groups with unknown pneumonia were first reported by Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported its first case of death.
In the meantime, the epidemic has spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, cases of infection were reported among health care providers, suggesting that the disease could be transmitted from person to person.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was shut down with all public transport halted.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients were in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the site of infection initiation from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and around 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final scale and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients provided a more up-to-date explanation of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly those between the ages of 30 and 65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over the age of 50, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected a larger number of men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has expanded between groups mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset of the infection to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The primary reproduction number (primary reproduction number) was 3.77 (95% confidence range: 3.51-4.05), and the modified primary reproduction number was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, in line with the many travel operations before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate among confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% confidence range: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% confidence range: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60), and acute pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a class of large, enveloped viruses that contain a single-chain, positive-direction RNA genome.
It can be divided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, and the alpha- and beta-sex coronaviruses are known to infect humans.
The fork coated (S) of the sugar protein binds to its cellular receptor, the angiotensin-2-converting enzyme (ACE2) and the betadyl dipeptide 4 (DPB4) of SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The genome of viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, accompanied by the sugary envelope proteins and cavitation proteins, forms vesicles containing virions, which merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus afterwards.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
It was discovered that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with a genetic identity exceeding 99.98% among 10 sequenced samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Wuhan seafood market.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
It was revealed through electron microscopy of the transport that SARS-CoV-2 is present in extremely thin sections of the human airway epithelium.
It was discovered that human ACE-2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human enzyme converted to angiotensin II weaker than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in SARS-CoV patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and limit the expression of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>; however, the orf8 does not contain any scale or pattern that has a known function.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou et al. reported the full-length structure of the human enzyme converted to angiotensin 2 under a 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> supercooled electron microscope within a compound with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They discovered that the compound, which had open and closed structures, had accumulated to form a demer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could bind to the S protein, providing evidence for the identification of the coronavirus and infection.
Sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original host and intermediate host
Sars-Cove and Mers-Cove are known to have originated from bats and been transported to humans by cats of butter and beauty, respectively.
By comparing the strain evolution of SARS-CoVZ-2 to other coronaviruses, bats were considered the original host of SARS-CoV-2, with the new virus accounting for 96% of the SARS-like coronaviruses from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross the inter-factional barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the path of transmission has not yet been clarified.
G et al. proposed snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans, which involved a symmetrical recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that squamous anteaters – long-tongue ant-eating mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine – are the potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic similarity in the coronavirus detected in squamous anteaters and in SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% variation spread across two genomes is still a significant difference; hence, we await conclusive results with concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in the laboratory for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature below 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and humidity between 40% and 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and temperature at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at a concentration of 75%, chlorine-containing disinfectants, pyrooxyacetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorohexidine, can effectively inhibit the virus.
The entire human race generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so they are more likely to be infected with the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been received.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies that relate to other coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV, and Merce-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after an invasion of a host virus, the normal immune system recognizes it through a pattern recognition receptor (PRRS) including a CT-like receptor C, a TLR-like receptor, a NLR-like receptor, and a RIG-I-like receptor.
Through various pathways, the virus induces the emergence of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate large macrophage cells of viral antigens.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus escape immune responses.
The adaptive immune response soon joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies dedicated to the virus, and CD8<0x2B> T cells kill cells directly infected with the virus.
T-cells produce assistive cytokines for inflammation to help the defending cells.
However, the coronavirus can reduce T-cell function by inducing programmed T-cell death.
Mixture immunity, including complementary proteins such as C3a, C5a and antibodies, is also essential in the fight against viral infections.
For example, isolated antibodies were neutralized from a recovered Mers-Cove patient.
On the other hand, the immune system’s overreaction generates a large number of locally free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case scenario, a failure of multiple organ functions and death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which initially appeared in groups, is more likely to affect older people with multiple diseases and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function has been damaged to have a higher chance of infection than others.
The estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, or mostly 3-7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period averaged 3 days and ranged between 0 and 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the strictest incubation period, thus preventing people who are infected but do not have symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, people exposed to or infected with the virus are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the main and primary symptom of COVID-19, and may not be accompanied by any other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nasal jaundice, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or hypoxia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients developed rapidly to suffer from acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and thrombocytopenia.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and severe fever should be examined, even without undergoing imaging that detects pulmonary abnormalities, in search of the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
Similar results have been reported in two recent studies of a group from a family and a group to which the infection was transmitted from a person who did not show symptoms.
By comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that Merce-Cove patients also suffered from fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed respiratory support much more than COVID-19 patients and were consistent with Merce’s higher mortality rate than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in Mers patients.
In SARS patients, it was found that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the most important symptoms, and that respiratory support was required for about 14%-20% of patients.
By 14 February, the death rate due to COVID-19 was 2%, while the confirmed cases were 66,576 globally.
By comparison, the SARS death rate by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For Mers, the death rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic study conducted in June 2012.
A previous study reported that the primary reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 with a 95% confidence range from 5.71 to 7.23, while the primary reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 ranged between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2, Mers-CoV and Sars-CoV in terms of their symptoms, mortality rate, and baseline reproduction number is shown in Table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is much more difficult to control than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The onset of illness in communities often occurs in the same household or from the same assembly or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel to or stay in Wuhan or other affected areas, or of contact with people or patients during the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks, and recovering patients who have been discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, sending an alarm to increase quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or low number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, lymphadenopathy with white blood cell count; 4 <0xC3><0x97> 109/L including lymphocyte count; 1 <0xC3><0x97> 109/L, elevated levels of aspartate amine transporter and vasodilator were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Levels of liver, muscle and myoglobin enzymes have increased in the blood of some patients, increased C-reactive protein and the rate of erythrocyte ablation in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-demer, which is the result of breaking fibrin in the blood, increased, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Disruptions in radiography appear in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by double patchy shadows or a layered glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients sometimes experience atypical pneumonia, severe lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid build-up, and elevated fibrosis severely affect gas exchange.
The functional dysfunction of type 1 and type 2 lung cells reduces the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, thus, reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst results of chest radiography and the maximum extent of the disease are often compared.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pulmonary cell peeling, hyelin membrane formation, interstitial lymphocytic lesion, and multiple cell nuclei in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, in line with the pathology of viral infection, acute respiratory distress syndrome and similar to those of patients with SARS.
The discovery of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through the polymerase chain reaction of reverse transcriptase (PT-PCR) has been used as a key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negative outcomes, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations of the diagnosis (which is no longer individually dependent on RT-PCR) began to be used in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiographic findings is essential for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Fengchang Group described a protocol for using CRISPR-based Sherlock technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, and it detects pieces of SARS-CoV-2's synthesized RNA at a rate of 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 moles/liters to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 moles/liters per microliter of input.
We hope that the new technology will be able to significantly improve sensitivity and suitability if verified in clinical samples.
Due to a lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors are able to provide supportive care mainly for COVID-19 patients, while trying a variety of treatments that have been used or previously proposed to treat other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovering patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients has been suggested to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and antiviral vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially, and may also attack, and to a lesser extent, other organs that release angiotensin-2-transforming enzyme, such as the digestive system, intestines, and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and failure represent the most serious threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, noninvasive respirators, and invasive artificial respirators based on the severity of the disease.
Patients with acute respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECM-OH), a cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat heart failure or life-threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining fluid balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions, are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokine storm is known to result from an excessive immune system reaction in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory reaction characterized by a series of cytokines including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals and are the main cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for acute patients.
Activated hormones, toxylizumab, and an anti-interleukin 6 monoclonal antibody were used to treat the cytokine storm.
Other cytokine storm immunosuppression treatments include T-cell-directed immune response modulation; blockade of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; Janus kinase inhibition; plenatomumab; cytokine signal suppression 4; and histone desacetylase inhibitors.
Steroids and immunosuppressants have been widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids in larger doses were not helpful with severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it may cause severe side effects, especially angioplasty, which severely affects the prediction of disease progression.
However, short cycles of anabolic hormones in small to medium doses have been recommended with caution for critical COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no antiviral treatment has been confirmed effective.
However, it was discovered that giving Rimdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, intravenously was effective with an American COVID-19 patient.
Remedisvir is a novel antiviral initially developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, RimdiSevier also showed potential inhibition of other viruses with single-chain RNA, including Merce and SARS viruses.
Based on these viruses, Gilead presented the compound to China for some experiments on individuals with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, parecitinib, interferon-alpha, lupinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been proposed as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used with patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from a disease prepared to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy individuals from developing the disease has a long history.
Already, recovering patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (IGs) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize and directly neutralize molecules unique to pathogens.
Based on this, the plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients with serious conditions.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by decreased inflammation and viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to put this method to widespread use before specific treatments can be found.
In addition, due to therapeutic effects, some plasma-related defects need to be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high for the treatment of patients with critical conditions.
It is difficult to develop specific antibodies and produce them quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, isolating B-cells from recovered patients and identifying the genetic codes that encode active antibodies, or screening for active antibodies against the virus’s core proteins, is more decisive and practical.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend heavily on a combination of multiple components in a combination that varies according to the diagnosis of the disease based on theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most of the active ingredients remain unknown or obscure as they are difficult to extract and verify for optimal ingredients or formulations.
Currently, due to the lack of an effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become one of the important alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, the effectiveness of Xu Feng Ji Doo capsules and Lian Hua King Win capsules for the treatment of COVID-19 was discovered.
The highest cure rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used traditional Chinese medicine in 87% of their patients, including Ganzo (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used only traditional Chinese medicine with about 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is quite a rough comparison, as many other impact factors such as the number of patients and the severity of their cases should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Polly Chang and his co-workers published a study comparing the treatment of Western Medicine (WM) alone with the combined treatment of Western and Traditional Chinese Medicine.
They found that the time needed to recover from hyperthermia, symptom loss, and hospital stay was much shorter in the Western Medicine <0x2B> Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment group than in the Western Medicine only treatment group.
Most impressively, the exacerbation rate of symptoms (ranging from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the Western Medicine <0x2B> Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment group compared to the Western Medicine only group (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the Western Medicine <0x2B> Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment group compared to the Western Medicine only group (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine is still waiting for more well-studied experiments on larger scales and in more centres.
It will also be interesting to describe the mechanism of the procedures and to clarify the effective components of traditional Chinese medicine treatments or their formulations if possible.
Patients suspected or confirmed of COVID-19 often feel a severe fear of the highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people under quarantine feel bored, lonely, and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as the negative effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by anabolic hormones, can lead to more anxiety and mental disorder.
In the first phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric illnesses were reported including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies.
Tracking mandatory contact and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigmatisation on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, persons suspected of having COVID-19, persons in contact with them, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the creation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear contacts with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and treatment plans, and the use of specialized electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact with each other.
Effective vaccines to cut the virus transmission chain from animal reservoirs and infected humans to susceptible hosts are necessary and are often complementary to antiviral therapy in the fight against epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-based vaccines to generate neutral, effective, long-term antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models of SARS treatment.
However, the effectiveness of these biofiltered vaccines in the elderly and fatal challenge models and in their prevention of infection with the animal-source virus was not determined before the start of a clinical study.
This is probably because SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
By contrast, sporadic MERS cases and groups continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of animal sources in endemic areas.
Immunization strategies against Mers were developed using an inactive virus, hypoxic RNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and subunits of recombinant protein, some of which were evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, overcoming the difficulty is a challenge due to the length of time (an average of 18 months) needed to develop a vaccine and the dynamic changes of the coronavirus.
As a novel disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its full clinical course through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequelae.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high prevalence rates and mortality in severe patients.
Therefore, building a model of disease outlook is essential for health care agencies to prioritize their services, particularly in resource-constrained areas.
Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may influence or be associated with the disease progression outlook in COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in determining the progression of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
The age groups between 30 and 65 were mainly infected with COVID-19, with 47.7% of these patients over the age of 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care were much more likely to develop underlying comorbidities and complications and were much older than those who did not need them (at an average age of 66 vs. 51), indicating age as a predictive factor for COVID-19 outcomes.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Accompanying diseases and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injuries and arrhythmias.
Cardiac accidents were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to positive bile cells with the angiotensin-2-converting enzyme, which may lead to liver dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that the underlying age and disease are strongly related and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury, and has been suggested to be a predictive factor for disease, response to treatment, and eventual recovery.
The association between the level of C-reactive protein and the severity of COVID-19 disease and its outlook has also been suggested.
In addition, elevated lactate-hydrogen derivative enzyme (LDH), aspartate amine transporter (AST), alanine amine transporter enzyme (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes appear strongly in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional signs of dysfunctions in the heart or liver.
Main clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and the progressive progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other problems to predict the outcome of COVID-19 and its complications.
Doping use: As described above, doping is an immunosuppressant commonly used as an adjuvant treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the use of a high dose of stimulant hormones on a large scale in SARS patients, many survivors have suffered angioplasty with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, steroids should be used at a low dose and for a short time in patients with COVID-19, if necessary.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients experienced exceptional stress; they often endured long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help those patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological features than SARS.
In addition to reincarnation in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively reincarnate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stage of infection, similar to other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stage or incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during daily activities, causing difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were in a severe condition, while most transmissions of the virus did not occur at the early stage.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and more difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Efforts are currently being made in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of disrupting the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although these measures have severely damaged the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, signaling a slowing epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the receding phase will last for 3 to 4 months.
However, some other experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others have created a model for predicting the outcome of the epidemic and have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mesothelioma and throat swabs of patients who recovered and left the hospital two weeks ago, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a cyclic seizure similar to the flu.
However, promising signs have emerged in China based on the declining number of new cases, which suggests that current strategies may have been working.
Ebola was originally expected to cause up to one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, the disease was eventually brought under control by strict quarantine and isolation measures.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can become weaker in terms of causing infection and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with SARS and MERS is presented below (figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 travels at a higher rate through coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with virus-contaminated materials.
The virus has also been found in the feces, raising the possibility of a new transition from feces to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41 percent of cases may be caused by hospital infections, including 17 patients with previous illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, great precautions need to be taken to protect human beings, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders who have come into contact with infected patients or people.
Wearing face masks is the first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from an infected person from moving through the air or sticking to material surfaces, where they can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (series 1860s) can protect against inhalation of small virions of between 10 and 80 nanometers, with only 5% of virions able to fully penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and is approximately 85 nanometers in size.
Because particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks aligned together, health care providers who are directly in contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series 1860s) but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear appropriate isolation suits to further reduce communication with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear transparent face protections or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay at home for self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected individuals.
Three feet is an appropriate distance to keep people away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its close resemblance to SARS-CoV as reported on January 7, 2020 would have caused a state of high alert in China based on its deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control did not reassure citizens until 19 January 2020 by saying that the novel virus has a low infection rate and limited human-to-human reproduction and there is no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This message severely reduced the alertness of the general public, especially when the entire state was preparing for the Spring Festival, and critical time was lost to contain the disease at its lowest extent in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies may benefit from this harsh lesson and implement substantial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more careful when issuing public statements because every word is important to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more responsive and effective training.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
It spread in less than two months across China and around 50 other countries globally at the time of writing.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has triggered a feeling of recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals more than young people and men more than women, and the rate of severity and mortality is also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they do not have symptoms, while SARS patients usually do so when they are severely ill, causing greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Normal RNA screening for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovering patients can become infected with the virus again.
These results significantly increase the risk of the virus spreading.
With this rapid progress in research on COVID-19, there are still many critical issues to be solved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Despite the discovery of a 96% genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-like coronavirus in bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal was the intermediate type that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, we can’t efficiently stop the transition, and the outbreak can come back at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical testing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-2-transforming enzyme, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to the ACE-2 secretory cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot make a quick and accurate diagnosis and deliver effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically during human-to-human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic, fade like SARS, or come back periodically like the flu?
It is necessary but it may take some time to look for answers to the above questions and many other questions.
However, at any cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return our lives to normal.
Animal Origins of Human Coronaviruses
The mutation and adaptation have been driving the co-evolution of coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two types of human coronaviruses (human coronaviruses) cause mild illness, such as a cold.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has shown the other side to reveal how life-threatening and severe the human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 brought the coronavirus back to light, surprising us with its rapid spread but with the ability to cause disease compared to his brother SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus is an animal disease of origin, so our understanding of the animal origins of human coronavirus would serve us well.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats where they were not pathogenic.
The intermediate hosts of some human coronaviruses have also been known.
The identification of host animals has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
The investigation of the interrelations between the coronavirus and the host in animals also offers an important insight into the emergence of coronavirus disease in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the available information about the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on their discovery history as well as their animal origins and interspecies transmission.
Most importantly, we compare and contrast different human coronaviruses from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The disease caused by the current 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, it also highlights the requirements for a successful host switch and the impact of complications of virus progression on the severity of the disease.
Coronaviruses belong to the family of coronaviruses, which includes a group of enveloped viruses with single-chain positive-direction RNA.
These viruses contain the largest genome among RNA viruses with a base of 26 to 32 kilos and are called "coronal viruses" by this name because their structure resembles a crown under an electron microscope.
In terms of synthetic properties, coronaviruses contain unfragmented genomes that share similar regulation.
Nearly two-thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping open-read templates (ORF1a and ORF1b), which convert into the multiple protein types pp1a and pp1ab.
Multiple proteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, referred to as nsp1<0x7E>16.
The remaining part of the genome contains open-reading templates for structural proteins, including Spike (S), Casing (E), Membrane (M), and Nuclear Protein (N).
Different strains of coronaviruses also encode a number of additional proteins from special strains.
Based on differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four types (alpha coronavirus, beta coronavirus, gamma coronavirus, and delta coronavirus), including those that include most human coronaviruses and are divided into four strains (A, B, C, and D).
Evidence of genetic evolution has shown that bats and rodents act as a genetic origin for most alpha-coronaviruses and beta-coronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-coronaviruses and delta-coronaviruses.
Over thousands of years, coronaviruses have consistently crossed species barriers and some have emerged as pathogens for serious human diseases.
So far, seven human coronaviruses (human coronaviruses) have been identified.
These include the human coronavirus-229E and the human coronavirus-NL63, both of which belong to the alpha-coronaviruses.
The other five beta-coronaviruses include the human coronavirus-OC43, the human coronavirus-HKU1, the SARS-CoV-associated coronavirus, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronavirus-229E, human coronavirus-OC43, human coronavirus-HKU1, and human coronavirus-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a cold, diarrhea, or both.
By contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 virus are all highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in more patients with a higher probability of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARS) and non-pneumonic symptoms.
Human coronavirus-229E, the first strain B814, was isolated from nasal secretions of patients with colds in the mid-1960s.
Much of the information has since been gathered through extensive studies on the human coronavirus-229E and the human coronavirus-OC43, whose symptoms are automatically cured.
In fact, it was generally accepted that infection with human coronaviruses was harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is one of the deadliest epidemics in our history, with more than 8,000 people infected with an estimated 10 percent death toll.
Ten years later, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has spread steadily across the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 novel human coronavirus), renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the current causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic, which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people on March 3, 2020.
The alarm goes off and the world must prepare for the next SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have animal origins from bats, mice, or pets.
Multiple evidence supports the evolutionary origins of all human coronaviruses from bats, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic but exhibit significant genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has raised enormous medical, scientific, social, and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Tracking the animal origins of human coronaviruses has shown a framework for understanding natural history, driving force and limiting factors for interspecies mobility.
This may also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate host, and inflated host animal (inflated host animals) of SARS-CoV-2, with important effects to prevent future repercussions.
In this review we provide an overview of animal origins, interspecies transmission, and the cause of human coronavirus diseases.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common belief that the original viruses of human coronaviruses are usually not pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts but become pathogenic after they are transferred between species to a new host.
We also review the evaluation of the human coronavirus pathway as the increase in its transmissibility is often accompanied by a decrease in the severity of the disease.
We also discuss in this context the results of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of the B814 strain of the human coronavirus-229E from the nasal secretions of cold-infected patients, various types of coronaviruses were isolated from various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past decades, seven types of human coronavirus have been identified.
The presentation of a brief summary of the history of the discovery of the human coronavirus in chronological order (Table 1) will be educational and indicative.
The first strain of the human coronavirus-229E was isolated from the respiratory system of patients with upper respiratory infection in 1966, after which it adapted to live in the ranks of the WI-38 lung cells.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise, and sore throat, with fever, coughing in approximately 10<0x7E>20% of cases.
Later in 1967, the human coronavirus-OC43 was isolated from the organ farm and subsequent transmission was in the brains of infant mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be distinguished by symptoms of infection with other respiratory viruses such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Human coronavirus-229E and human coronavirus-OC43 have spread globally, and tend to migrate during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a feeling of illness for about two weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, healthy individuals with the human coronavirus-229E have caused a mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients showed severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, is the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in human history and the causative agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first case of SARS occurred in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8,096 confirmed cases and 774 deaths, and has spread across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the super-contagion, it has been estimated that a single case of infection can lead to almost two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the peak viral load appearing on day 10 of the disease.
The onset of SARS-CoV symptoms begins with muscle pain, headache, fever, malaise, and chills, followed by delayed symptoms of difficulty breathing, coughing and respiratory distress.
Lymphoid deficiency, impaired liver function, and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
In SARS patients, there is also widespread damage to the alveoli, the proliferation of phenotype cells, and an increase in the number of macrophages.
About 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and artificial respiration.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, in severe cases many organs, including the digestive system, liver, and kidneys, can also be infected and usually accompanied by a cytokine storm that can be fatal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the first case who travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to research on the human coronavirus.
The human coronavirus-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be common in young children, the elderly, and immunodeficiency patients with respiratory diseases.
Colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchitis are common symptoms of the disease caused by the human coronavirus-NL63.
Another independent study described isolating the same virus from a sample of the nose of an 8-month-old child with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it is widespread worldwide.
Human coronavirus NL63 is estimated to be responsible for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, peaking during early summer, spring and winter.
Human coronavirus-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as strangulation.
In the same year, the human coronavirus-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, HKU1 has been reported to be associated with exacerbations of severe asthma attacks.
Human coronavirus-HKU1 has been found to be widespread worldwide, causing mild respiratory illnesses, similar to human coronavirus-NL63, human coronavirus-229E, and human coronavirus-OC43.
All four of these community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and, in general, are likely to mutate to cause diseases with low prevalence rates, but the coincidence occurred for unknown reasons as in the rare case of the more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these coronaviruses acquire the ability to efficiently transmit and continuously maintain themselves within humans, they also become less virulent or diseased.
Merce-Cove was first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient’s lung that had pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, in many European countries and Tunisia, cases brought in from abroad and a rare secondary transfer of contacts in close personal contact have been reported.
Another secondary outbreak in South Korea in 2015 resulted in 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical symptoms caused by Myers are similar to those caused by SARS, and are characterized by a worsening acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many people with MERS also experienced severe kidney failure, which MERS is distinguished from other diseases caused by the human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients suffer from intestinal infectious symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
On 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making Merce-Cove one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
From mid-December to late 2019, groups of pneumonia patients later identified as being caused by SARS-CoV-2 were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the current outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection due to SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international importance as called COVID-19.
On 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with an initial fatality rate of 3.4%.
The mortality rate in Hubei Province of China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV, and appears in the form of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea also appears in some people who are infected.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the large homogeneity of nucleotide sequences by 82%, they belong to different branches in the tree of lineage evolution.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less severe but more contagious compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
People with no symptoms have been reported despite being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may be contributing to its rapid worldwide spread.
The comparison and contrast between SARS-CoV-2 and the other six human coronaviruses revealed significant similarities and differences.
First, human coronaviruses are similar in the incubation period and time period of the disease.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 infection falls between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired from the community (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 has features that are more common in community-acquired HCoV infections, including the appearance of unspecified or minor symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in SARS-CoV, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission shows interesting patterns of both human coronaviruses acquired from the community and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the transmission potential of human coronaviruses acquired from the community.
On the other hand, checking whether the transportability of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced after transmission to humans remains the same as in cases of SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples as in other human coronaviruses.
Further studies are still needed in the future to clarify whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission from the oral anal route plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least in some cases.
It is worth considering whether SARS-CoV-2 may show a seasonal spread, as is the case with human coronaviruses acquired from the community.
However, the attributes of SARS-CoV-2, including the potential for transmission, and the mechanism of sustainable post-human transmission, will have an impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four human coronaviruses acquired from the community and causing minor symptoms have adapted well to humans.
Another perspective, which may also be true, is that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, they may both be survivors of the old human coronavirus pandemics.
Human coronaviruses that infect humans with severe diseases, as well as humans that have been infected with severe human coronavirus diseases, have been eliminated.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in humans enough to allow the adaptive mutations facing host-restricted factors to accumulate.
From this logic, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the greater the number of people with it, the greater the chance that it will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, it is difficult to stop its transmission between humans by quarantine or other infection control measures.
The four community-acquired coronaviruses have been circulating among human populations for many years, causing colds in people with good immunity.
These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.
By contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which cause severe impairment, did not adapt well to humans, and were unable to continue to move between humans.
They need to stay in and reproduce in their animal reservoirs and then look for the right opportunity to move on to the most vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate and inflated hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar features to both SARS-CoV/Merce-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired from the community.
It is as contagious as human coronaviruses acquired from society, at least for now.
However, it causes the disease more than human coronaviruses acquired from the community and less than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is not yet clear whether it will fully adapt to humans and spread among them without the need for a warehouse or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it would be useful for us to review the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, stored, intermediate, and amplified hosts of human coronaviruses.
The animal acts as the evolutionary host of the human coronavirus if it harbors the closely related parent virus and shares a significant symmetry in the level of nucleotide sequences.
The original virus is usually well-adapted and non-pathogenic to this host.
Similarly, the warehouse host continuously and over a long period of time shelters the human coronavirus.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the human coronavirus or its parent virus.
By contrast, if the HCoV enters the newly intermediate host just before or near attacking humans, it does not adapt well to the new host and often causes morbidity.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and also act as an amplified host by allowing the virus to temporarily replicate and thus transmit it to humans to expand the spread of infection among humans.
Human coronavirus infection may reach a dead end if the virus fails to transmit from within the intermediate host.
Human coronaviruses, on the contrary, can also adapt to the intermediate host and may even colonize it for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural warehouse host.
Epidemiological data later revealed that the first case of SARS had a history of contact with the game.
Seroconversion surveys then indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of SARS-CoV IgG compared to normal people.
It was first determined that the masked palm fronds (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in the live animal markets carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This indirectly supported the fact that no other case of SARS was reported after all the yogurt cats were killed in the market.
However, it has been reported that the result of SARS-CoV screening in masked palm fronds that live in the wild or on farms without exposure to live animal markets has been largely negative, indicating that masked palm fronds may only be an amplified intermediate host, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that since 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou markets have SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals also play the role of the inflated intermediate host of SARS-CoV is not excluded.
All of these seem to be hosts who don't transport SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV led to the detection of the closely related bat coronavirus, called the Chinese goosebump bat virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome HKU3 (Chinese goosebump bat virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome HKU3), which is found in the Chinese goosebump bat.
The result of the examination of SARS-CoV antibodies in these bats and the sequence of the genome of the Chinese red horse bat virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (HKU3) was positive.
This virus and other bat coronaviruses share a nucleotide sequence similarity of 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are hosts to emerging human pathogens.
Many SARS-like coronaviruses (SARS-like coronaviruses) have been identified from bats, but none have been isolated as a living virus with the exception of WIV1.
The human angiotensin-2-converting enzyme (angiotensin-2-converting enzyme) is known to be the receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 from a bat stool sample was shown to be using the angiotensin-2-converting enzyme in bats, butter cats, and humans as a receptor for cell entry.
Interestingly, those recovering from severe acute respiratory syndrome had the ability to equalize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 is the most closely related SARS-CoV virus in bats, sharing a 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Despite the high similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not a direct reservoir host for SARS-CoV.
Analysis of the evolution of the Mers-Cove strains in the coronavirus-HKU4 group in bats and the coronavirus-HKU5 in bats themselves.
The coronavirus HKU4 is used in bats and Merce-Cove by the same host receptor, dipeptidel-peptidase4 (dipeptidel-peptidase-4), to enter the virus.
Polymerase RNA sequences based on Mers-CoV RNA are closer in terms of the evolution of the strains to their counterparts than beta-coronaviruses in bats identified in Europe and Africa.
It has not yet been discovered that Merce-Cove lives in wild bats.
Merce-Cove and the coronavirus coronavirus HKU25 share only 87% of the nucleotide sequences in their closest bats.
Thus, the host bat may not be the direct warehouse of Merce-Cove.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the only serum-positive camels are Merce-Cove’s equivalent antibodies, as well as Middle Eastern camels in many African countries.
Mers-Cove was isolated from the nasal swabs of the only hump camel, indicating that the camel served as the host of the original Mers-Cove repository.
It is also worth noting that mild symptoms generally appeared in camels experimentally infected with Merce-Cove, but extensive viral scattering was observed.
The infected camels were remarkably proliferating not only by breathing but also by the oral anal route, which is the primary route of proliferating the virus from bats.
However, questions remain because many confirmed cases of Merce do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, and these cases are logically attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown routes of transmission involving unrecognized species of animals harbouring Merce-Cove.
SARS-CoV-2 is involved in bats isolated from horseshoe bats in a 96.2% nucleotide similarity.
The sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is so long that it is difficult to determine the relationship to the father, as in the cases of SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV.
This means that bats may not be the direct host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 unless nearly identical bat coronaviruses are found in the future.
The intermediate host animals of SARS-CoV-2 are supposed to be among the species of wild animals sold and killed at the Wuhan seafood market, which has been associated with many of the initial cases of COVID-19, suggesting the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on the metagenomics sequence have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as manis javanica can also harbor the original beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The novel coronavirus genomes of these anteaters and SARS-CoV-2 share a nucleotide sequence similarity of 85-92%.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 by about 90% similarity at the level of nucleotide sequences.
Two subspecies of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses are clustered in the strain evolution tree, one of which shares a similar receptor binding domain with SARS-CoV-2, with amino acid sequences matching 97.4%.
In stark contrast, the receptor binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 differ significantly, although the similarity of the entire genome sequence is higher.
A previous study of sick squamous anteaters also revealed the presence of viral organisms from lung samples, which turned out to be similarly associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted various assemblage methods and manual processing to generate a partial genome sequence consisting of a nearly 86.3% full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the termite eater is one of the intermediate host animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that squamous anteaters are the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 because of the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated coronaviruses in squamous anteaters.
Additionally, the spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is lower than the spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-coronaviruses in squamous anteaters.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, squamous anteaters, and other mammals is still being mapped.
While the highest sequence symmetry was found in the receptor binding domains between SARS-CoV-2 and squamous anteaters, the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13-associated beta-coronaviruses share a higher symmetry of the complete genome sequence.
One of the dominant speculations is that the high degree of similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domains in ants-eating squamouss belonging to the coronavirus beta and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selective convergent evolution.
There is a counterproposal suggesting recombination between SARS-CoV-2 in ants-eating squamous belonging to the coronavirus beta and RaTG13 in third wild animal species.
Recombination is widespread among beta-coronaviruses as a driving force for evolution.
The direct animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the animal origin of the human coronavirus-229E, the human coronavirus-OC43, the human coronavirus-NL63, and the human coronavirus-HKU1 has also been studied.
Evidence of strain evolution has suggested that both the human coronavirus-NL63 and the human coronavirus-229E may have originated from bat coronaviruses, while the parent viruses of the human coronavirus-OC43 and human coronavirus-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
The coronavirus in bats called ARCoV.2 (Coronavirus Appalachian Highlands) detected in tricoloured bats in North America has been reported to be closely related to the human coronavirus-NL63.
On the other hand, the human coronavirus-229E has been found to be genetically linked to another coronavirus in bats, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, and camels are also suspected to be its intermediate host.
For clarity, current information on the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The analysis of the evolution of the strains provided evidence of cases of human coronavirus transmission between species throughout history.
When the HCoV-OC43 cross-species infected humans from domestic livestock around 1890, an epidemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of human coronavirus-229E transmission between species is still less clear.
Alpha coronaviruses have been found in bats to be closely related to the human coronavirus 229E.
There is an alpha-coronavirus in the alpaca.
Many evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans, not alpacas, may have contact with bats in a common habitat.
Humans are in close contact with alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E in bats is multi- and non-pathogenic in bats, while HCoV-229E in alpaca causes respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-coronavirus associated with alpaca has not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that the alpaca has been infected with the human coronavirus 229E of the human coronavirus alpha cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause diseases in humans including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
So it’s no surprise that bats may transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
While the alpha-coronaviruses in bats act as a synthesis of the genes of the human coronavirus-229E, the only alpaca and camel humps may act as intermediate hosts that transmit the viruses to humans, just as in Merce-Cove.
Merce-Cove gives an excellent example of the transition between species as it moves from bats to single-sam camels and from single-sam camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the Merce-Coff bat has been known since the beginning of its identification and has also been enhanced by subsequent results.
It is clear that bats provide a rich collection of virus species to exchange genes within the same species and transmit them between species.
Bats are characterized by longevity, living in overcrowded colonies, close social interaction, and strong flying ability, all of which are favorable conditions for making them an ideal “viral distributor”.
Merce-Cove, on the other hand, has moved into the only camel-shaming for decades.
These camels have adapted so well that they have gone from an intermediate host to a natural and stable warehouse host.
Mers-Cove causes very minor disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
His intermittent transmission to humans remains a coincidence and man is a non-conductive host for Merce-Cove where his transmission cannot continue.
Unlike the role of camels in the transport of Mers-Cove, the role of squamous anteaters, if any, in the transport of Sars-Cove-2 is different.
In particular, beta-coronaviruses associated with squamous ants are highly pathogenic.
They may be non-transporting hosts for SARS-CoV-2, which belongs to the coronavirus beta, similar to the cat in the SARS-CoV case.
Future studies will resolve many of the possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 transmission between animal species to humans by either proving or excluding them.
First, bats may be hosts of a SARS-CoV-2-associated virus reservoir, which is mostly identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans and bats may share an ecological habitat through slaughtering or coal mining.
Second, squamous anteaters can be one of the intermediate amplified hosts of the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2-associated virus.
Humans are infected with the virus by slaughtering and consuming game meat.
Many mammals, including pets, are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2.
A scan of antibodies in domestic and wild animals is warranted.
Third, as mentioned above, a recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has contact with bats and squamous anteaters.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, on the viral side there are three main factors that are also important in facilitating the infection of coronaviruses to overcome species barriers.
First, her mutation rates are relatively high at doubling her RNA.
Estimated rates of coronavirus mutations, compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, can be considered "medium" or "high" with an average switching rate of <0x7E>10-4 cases per year for site 2, depending on the stage of coronavirus adaptation to new hosts.
Coronaviruses include an externally corrected ribonuclease enzyme, which can result in extremely high transmutability and attenuation or inability to develop.
Interestingly, Rimdisevir is a nucleotide analogue known for its ability to suppress the replication of the coronavirus by inhibiting the external ribonuclease enzyme and RNA polymerase based on RNA.
Rimdesivir is one of the anti-sarscove-2 progenitor agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rates of coronavirus mutations are about a million times higher than those of hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when coronaviruses do not adapt appropriately to the host.
The mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably low when compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It seems that he has already adapted to another human-near host.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the Mirs-CoV, which has adapted well to the single camel hump.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to help vaccines and antiviral drugs resist SARS-CoV-2 by rapidly impairing its effectiveness.
Second, the massive RNA genome of coronaviruses actively provides additional plasticity in the genome modification of mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the likelihood of interspecies evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions become appropriate.
This is supported by unique abundant open-reading templates and protein-encoded functions near the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2> end of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and repeatedly switch molds during RNA replication through a unique “copy selection” mechanism.
In a host that is like a mixing vessel, sequence switching occurs frequently during RNA replication of the coronavirus.
High-end full-length RNAs and secondary genomics may recombinate to generate new coronaviruses.
Evidence for the evolution of strains for natural recombination has been found in HKU1 and OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as the bat-like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and HKU9 in bats.
Virus interaction with the host associated with the transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
In this regard, we take the SARS-CoV recombination as a typical example, which has also shown evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission incidents.
Based on comparative analysis of isolated samples of SARS-CoV in humans and civets, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly through mutations in the receptor binding field of S protein.
In general, the receptor binding domain of the S-coronavirus protein interacts with the cellular receptor and is selected intensively through the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the receptor binding field in amino acids occurs from 318 to 510 in the S1 molecule, which is associated with the angiotensin-2-converting enzyme as well as the adjuvant receptors for virus entry.
The receptor binding field of SARS-CoV is able to recognize ACE-2 receptors in various animals, including bats, cat-crats, mice, and raccoons, allowing the virus to be transmitted between species.
In fact, only six amino acids that were different from human and cat-crat viral isolates were observed in the receptor binding domain, and four of them are found in the receptor binding sequence pattern to interact with the ACE-2 receptor.
The K479N and S487T mutations are found in the SARS-CoV receptor binding domain in the cat’s yogurt, which can increase the likelihood of spike protein interaction in the human angiotensin-2 receptor.
In other words, these two types of amino acid alternatives may be critical to viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV-2.
There is a 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S-1 unit of the S-protein, which implies that the likelihood of S-protein binding in the human angiotensin-2-transforming enzyme has changed.
Indeed, an ultra-cold electron microscopy study indicated a 10- to 20-fold higher probability of this association than that between the human angiotensin-2-transforming enzyme and the SARS-CoV-S protein.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other type of assistive receptor may be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
It is also interesting that the human coronavirus-NL63 is also related to the angiotensin-2-transforming enzyme but in a different part of protein S.
There are several other HCoV receptors, such as the HCoV-229E protein analyzer and the 9-O rectified sialic acid of HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after transitioning between species from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of human coronaviruses is also subject to the control of other factors of reliability and host limitations.
The fragmentation of these host proteins between humans and hosts of natural reservoirs of coronaviruses, such as bats, sole humps, and rodents, may be a barrier to cross-species transmission.
Human coronaviruses need to control and weaken host dependencies to carry out successful interspecies transmission.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction remain detectable and characteristic.
Wide, unbiased genome scans can be used to examine the reliability and host limitations of SARS-CoV-2 using cutting-edge CRISPR technology.
The emergence of new human coronaviruses: back to the starting point
The diversity of coronaviruses in bats offers abundant opportunities for the emergence of novel human coronaviruses.
Based on this logic, coronaviruses in bats are a genetic compound of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of the human coronavirus and are two important points in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein coding genes involves the ability to significantly modify viral phenotypes.
Among the regulatory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was thought to be important in adapting to humans, as SARS-CoV-associated viruses were isolated in bats but were found to encode disparate ORF8 proteins.
The 29 nucleotide deletion properties of SARS-CoV were found in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion has split ORF8a into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes flight attendant switching.
Additionally, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination through strains of the alpha and gamma coronaviruses, with a large number of small recombination areas identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
In a similar way, research has shown that the Merce-Coff epidemic has seen recombinations between different strains, which have occurred in Saudi Arabia’s only humpback camels.
In addition to SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV, cases of recombination have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, where human coronaviruses have been combined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-constructive genes.
It should be noted that artificial selection can also help with unintended changes in the viral genome, most of which are likely to result from viruses getting rid of selective stressors, such as what’s happening with the host’s immune system.
The loss of the full-length ORF4 protein in the human coronavirus-229E phenotype strain due to the deletion of two nucleotides is an example of these effects.
Although ORF4 can be observed in camels and bat viruses associated with the human coronavirus-229E, the alpha-coronavirus, which infects the alpaca, shows a single nucleotide stitch, which leads to the mutation of the framing.
Last but not least, the evolution of new coronaviruses is also driven by selective pressure in their warehouse hosts.
Unsympathetic or mildly symptomatic cases have only been detected when bats are infected with coronaviruses, indicating a mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It showed that bats adapted appropriately to coronaviruses anatomically and physiologically.
For example, poor activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduced the pathogens raised by coronaviruses.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats was suppressed due to an increased rate of NKG2/CD94 inhibitory natural killer cell receptor and a low expression level of Category I primary histological compatibility compound molecules.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen compounds (reactive oxygen compounds) caused by the increased metabolic activity of bats can lead to both suppression of the replication of the coronavirus and effect correction by the external ribonuclease enzyme, thus providing selective stress for the emergence of highly pathogenic strains of the virus when a new host is infected.
Additional pathogenic strains of the coronavirus may arise by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt to the host.
Accordingly, it is no coincidence that three novel human coronaviruses have emerged over the past two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in warehouse hosts such as bats and camels.
They are strongly reproduced without provoking a strong immune response from the host.
Here are the secrets that explain why HIV-positive people who do not have symptoms and the causes of severe cases of human infection.
Acute symptoms are mainly caused by an overactive immune response and a cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in the case of non-symptom carriers, the immune response is disconnected from the replication of the coronavirus.
A similar strategy of immune response separability may have beneficial effects in SARS-CoV-2 antiretroviral therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, taking interferon type I can be used at least in the first stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the activation of the inflammatory particle NLRP3 in bats is weak.
With this mental logic, inhibition of the inflammatory particle Cryopyrin NLRP3 using the MCC950 inhibitor is useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While it was found that the beta-coronavirus in bats was involved in 95% nucleotide homogeneity, there was also a 96% nucleotide homogeneity in bats with SARS-CoV-2.
While it was discovered that the cats and other animals in the market housed viruses similar to SARS-CoV, they did not detect the intermediate direct hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
The beta-coronaviruses have been detected in squamous anteaters and are highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that squamous anteaters may be an intermediate host or that the beta-coronaviruses in squamous anteaters may have contributed genetic fragments leading to the final release of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made, either intentionally or by accident.
Coronaviruses have returned to focus due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our idea of the importance of the origins of zoonotic diseases and the animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
The overwhelming evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 all trace their origin to the bat and were transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
Based on the fact that SARS-CoV infection originated from human-cat contact in the markets, the closure of the fresh produce markets and the killing of the butter cats was supposed to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
By the same logic, squamous anteaters should be eliminated from the fresh produce markets to prevent the transmission of zoonotic disease, in light of the discovery of multiple strains of beta-coronavirus in squamous anteaters that are very close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether or not SARS-CoV-2 has been transmitted to humans, as well as however it is transmitted, through squamous anteaters and other mammals remains a topic that needs to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, Merce-Cove has been found in the lonely camels of sleep for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for local citizens.
It is widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all the beauty to control Merce, as officials in China’s wildlife markets have done to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, as well as other infection control measures.
Because we are unable to completely eliminate these viruses, new genetic patterns may arise and cause outbreaks.
A variety of coronaviruses associated with zoonotic diseases are found in wildlife.
In particular, coronaviruses are extremely diverse in bats that have the potential to cause zoonotic diseases.
There are many opportunities for the emergence and recombination of coronaviruses associated with zoonotic diseases, leading to the emergence of new, more transmissible and/or potentially deadly coronaviruses in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the ordeals that humanity has experienced due to SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, an appropriate preparedness and response plan should be prepared.
The truth is that a lot of viruses have taken their place on the planet for a very long time.
They live in their own natural reservoirs until they have an opportunity to spread and multiply.
Although bats carry many characteristics that predict the spread of viruses, the chance of human contact with bats and other species of wild animals can be reduced if humans adopt a culture that forces them to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is a necessary measure to better understand the environment of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which proves useful in preventing their transmission from animals to humans and preventing future emergences.
Finally, the best way to prevent zoonotic viral diseases is to keep humans away from the ecological sites of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
The mystery of the origin of the zoonotic disease of SARS-CoV-2 is still surrounded by many questions that require answering.
First, if bats transmit SARS-CoV-2 to squamous anteaters, it is important to know what conditions are in place for bats and squamous anteaters to share the same environmental space.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in the transmission of disease to man, then the way in which man communicates with them should be determined.
Third, if a third species of mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, then it should be explained how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and squamous ants.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be suspected of carrying SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental infection should be performed.
Whether the host is a bat, squamous anteater or other mammal, it is expected to identify SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses, which are roughly the same as their natural hosts in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will reveal the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important actions to prevent and combat COVID-19 in humans.
The need to update the “suspected case” and “confirmed case” criteria when diagnosing COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 novel coronavirus) infection, which provided our experience and included appropriate reference information to combat the pandemic globally.
Although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice experiences; thus, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidance and introduced the latest diagnostic criteria of “suspected case” and “confirmed case” in accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines (version 7) issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 novel coronavirus), which is now officially known as 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and has been dubbed coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team drafted a quick guideline and published it online in the Military Medical Research Journal on February 6, 2020.
He has received great attention since his publication.
Please note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice experiences; thus, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, from the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China’s COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (/http://www.nhc.gov.cn), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, seven issues were released in total with some contexts fundamentally changing.
Now our guidance has been answered by Cho and others, who have made a simple grade-monitoring proposal based on the clinical trial.
Their efforts have added new evidence to our guidance and have become a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We support their great effort and express our appreciation.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (experimental version 7) and recent studies.
According to the 7th edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of the suspected case needs to combine any one of the elements of epidemiological history characteristics with two of the elements of clinical manifestations to reach a comprehensive analysis, or three elements of clinical manifestations need to be verified in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel to Wuhan City, surrounding areas, or other communities with reported cases of COVID-19, or residence within the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (2) history of communication with SARS-CoV-2 cases (with positive DNA test results); (3) history of communication with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan City or other communities
Clinical manifestations: (i) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (ii) with imaging-proven characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (iii) showing the total number of white blood cells at a normal, low, or low level from the number of lymphocytes at the early stage of infection initiation.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on the suspected case involving any of the elements of the evidence of the presence of pathogens or serum stage reactions according to the following: (1) the positive result of the real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the high homogeneity of the entire viral genome sequence with the characteristics of the novel coronaviruses; (3) the positive results of the IgM specific antibody test and the antibody antibody IgM.
We see that the real-time DNA polymerase chain reaction test in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020).
The detection of pathogens in the blood sample was added to version 4 (January 27, 2020) and 5 (February 8, 2020); then the blood serum reaction guide was added to version 7.
These modifications have relied on the researchers’ ongoing work to come up with the design of an ideal DNA detection toolkit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory tract samples including blood samples, which has increased the availability of different samples, supporting the transfer of the positive result of the specific antibody to the criteria for confirmed cases.
In addition, there is growing evidence that calls for caution when dealing with patients with unusual symptoms and non-symptom conditions.
Therefore, the content of the information flow chart should be updated for Zhou and others, as they rated the clinically symptom-free person at a “low risk” grade.
The grading monitoring system also needs to be validated in practice and additional clinical studies.
In conclusion, we hope to reach more direct evidence and invite readers to provide us with their comments.
To diagnose the “suspect case” and the “confirmed case”, we call for the most up-to-date guidelines from home countries to be followed and adhered to.
Our team will also update our guidance in time to provide assistance.
Bangladesh registers five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily rate
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh reported that, as of yesterday, there were 114 active cases and 33 home-based recoveries.
Seventeen deaths have been recorded.
The director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, Dr. Mirjadi Sabrina Flora, told an online press conference that the deaths included four males and one female.
According to Dr. Mirjadi, there were two cases aged over 60, two cases aged between 51 and 60, and one case aged between 41 and 50.
She also said that two of the deaths were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
An official at a hospital told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saif Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Authority, who was receiving care at Kuwait Maitri Hospital.
Bangladesh’s Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaid Qadir, said in an online video statement on Saturday that public transport will stop longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
Disruption of public transport initially began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of basic commodities, namely, medical products, fuel and food, is still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh on March 8 for two people who returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
The three have already recovered by March 19.
SARS-CoV-2 infections exceed 1 million worldwide
Data from Johns Hopkins University on Thursday indicated that the total number of cases of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 exceeded one million worldwide.
COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus has caused at least 52,000 deaths.
This dangerous development came on the same day that Malawi confirmed the first coronavirus infections, and the first associated death was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that, as of Thursday, it is one of the few countries still free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 1051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 in the 24 hours leading up to 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported in the United States, with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, citing Johns Hopkins University data, reported more than 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday caused by coronavirus infection.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Thursday extended the closure of the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that salaries would continue to be paid to Russians without going to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency by 15 days, with 215 votes in favor, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the cities of Mecca and Medina to become all day; it was previously only from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike D. Wayne announced that the state extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Australia stores reduce limits on toilet paper purchases per transaction
Australian supermarket chains Wallworths and Coles on Saturday and Sunday night tightened restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper to be reduced to two rolls of Wallworths and one roll of Coles per transaction at all branches nationwide.
Aldi’s stores also identified one roll, on Monday.
These purchase restrictions were posted as messages at payment points in store chains and on their Facebook pages.
It has been reported that buyers have been stockpiling it due to COVID-19-related concerns in case people need self-isolation.
On Wednesday, Wallworths approved restrictions on delivery of toilet paper to homes, becoming one roll per purchase order.
These changes followed previous restrictions passed by Wallworths on March 4 and Coles on March 5 by allowing for only four rolls per transaction.
In its March 8 media release, Coles Stores reported that despite the implementation of the four-roll restrictions, “many stores still sell everything within one hour of receiving it,” and described the order as “unprecedented,” as well as Aldi Stores in a Facebook post on Tuesday as “unexpected.”
Sales increased “significantly” last week, according to a Wallworths store spokesman.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also determined that the amount allowed to be purchased is two rolls.
To ease the shortage, Coles stores asked suppliers for larger rolls and increased the pace of delivery, Wallworth stores asked for additional stock, while Aldi stores made their stock available for special offers scheduled for Wednesday early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to increase inventory, but the local council’s restrictions on the timing of truck deliveries made it difficult.
Production costs are expected to rise as suppliers try to meet demand, with few special offers.
On Tuesday, Aldi stores announced that as a result of the early availability of inventory, some stores will not be able to provide Wednesday’s special offer.
Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, told News.com.au that stores fill up every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a large commodity, which leads to a decrease in the amount of inventory in terms of numbers, and when sold in full, leaves large empty spaces on the shelves, which reinforces the feeling of shortage.
Russell Zimmerman, ABC News reported, “Colles and Woolworths stores have the view that [if] a lot of goods are on the shelves, and if products like toilet rolls and sterilizers can be bought and delivered in bulk, that might reduce the panic.”
Who Gives a Crap, which produces recycled toilet paper, reported on Wednesday that its stock had run out.
According to a News.com.au report, Kimberly-Clark, which produces Kleenex toilet wipes, and Solaris Pepper, which produces Sorpent wipes, confirmed that they are working 24/7 to continue providing their products.
Domain.com, a real estate website, noted that some real estate sellers offer free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held because buyers stopped working on the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday’s edition of NTT News, a daily publication in the city of Darwin, included eight-page advertisements made so that they could be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially hesitant about imposing restrictions, according to a report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on March 3 as the stores reported that they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a high demand for other products, including gags, sterilizers, dried goods, hand washing and flour.
In the same vein, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that a British online store called Okado identified Andres’ toilet paper purchases with two 12 rolls of paper.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday that the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 – a disease caused by the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) – has reached pandemic level.
Although the word “pandemic” refers only to the extent of the disease, and not to the seriousness of specific cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) has cautioned that governments should be urged to take the necessary measures:
“All countries can still change the course of this epidemic.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization, said: “If countries detect and conduct examinations of people, treat and isolate them, track their cases and mobilize them to confront them.”
“We are all very concerned about alarming levels of prevalence and risk, as well as alarming levels of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said in a statement published by CNN in February, “No other respiratory virus has been traced from the onset to the ongoing global spread, other than the flu.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying: “We have never been exposed to a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.”
“We’ve never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.”
The new situation is described as a pandemic following the World Health Organization’s decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, said of the outbreak: “The bottom line is that things are going to get worse.”
The Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide as of Thursday, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and was recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
China’s mortality rate was estimated at 4%, while globally it ranged from 13.04 percent in Algeria to .08 percent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The period between exposure to the injury and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is supportive and symptomatic treatment. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping people apart, monitoring, and self-isolation of those suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world are responding to this threat with travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures.
The pandemic has led to severe global social and economic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world’s student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and appearance, and other areas where there have been significant cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and closure rates for heavy industries, there has been a decline in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in the city of Wuhan (the capital of Hubei Province) in China reported a range of cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and the investigation began in early January 2020.
Cases are mostly associated with the Wuhan Seafood Wholesale Market, so the virus is believed to have an animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus and is closely related to coronaviruses in bats, coronaviruses in squamous anteaters, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first person with symptoms was diagnosed with the disease on December 1, 2019, and this person had no apparent contact with the virus.
Of the group of early cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report published in the South China Morning Journal indicated that a case dating back to 17 November 2019, 55 years old from Hubei Province, may have been the first case. On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that although reported new cases in China had declined, they had suddenly risen in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with the number of new cases outside China exceeding the number of new cases inside for the first time.
There may be a significant under-reporting of cases, particularly among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, with adults aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of Britons needed to be infected before an effective herd immunity procedure.
Cases indicate the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and have been confirmed to be infected according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had formal policies regarding non-testing for only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that an estimated 86 percent of COVID-19 cases had not been detected in China as of January 23, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection for 79 percent of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the cases recorded.
Preliminary estimates of the baseline reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 ranged between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the period from worsening symptoms to death takes between 6 and 41 days, the most common of which is 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, COVID-19 has caused approximately 97,000 deaths.
As of February 5, about 80% of deaths in China were concentrated in people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official statistics of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who have been confirmed to have COVID-19 according to official protocols.
The real number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, because it may not include people who die without being tested – for example; at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data in Italy revealed that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official number of COVID deaths recorded by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "that we know that [the number of deaths declared] reflects a lower estimate than reality", a statement supported by narrative reports of inaccuracies in the U.S. Such underestimations occur in cases of pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in January 2009 and the first confirmed deaths in 2009.
The first death outside mainland China was on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Many measures are commonly used to determine mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the size of the tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options and time spent since the outbreak began, and the characteristics of the population such as age, gender, and public health. The mortality to injury ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period of time.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-injury ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of mortality from infections decreased from 17.3% (for those who developed symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those who developed symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other metrics refer to the CFR, which reflects the percentage of those who died from the disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of those who died from the disease.
These statistics do not have a time frame and track a specific population from injury to the fate of the situation.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for certain population groups.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the infection death rate for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range corresponds to the results of the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany, and with a statistical study analyzing the effect of the test in the estimates of case mortality.
The World Health Organization (WHO) is stressing the possibility of controlling the pandemic.
The peak of the outbreak and its maximum duration are uncertain and may vary by location.
Masig Pony of Penn State University stated that, “The outbreaks of infectious diseases that are left uncontrolled usually peak and begin to decline afterwards when the disease finds no available hosts.
“But it’s almost impossible to make any reasonable predictions now about when that will happen.”
Chinese government chief medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said it "could end by June" if all countries could be motivated to follow the World Health Organization's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kocharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will be widespread perhaps for a year or two".
According to a study conducted by Imperial College London under the supervision of Neil Ferguson, we will need to rely on physical distancing and other measures “until a vaccine becomes available (perhaps after 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, “I think it’s unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely — because it’s easily transmissible,” and it could “turn into a seasonal disease — so it comes back every year.”
The ferocity of return will depend on collective immunity and the extent of the transformation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and may not show symptoms in those infected.
The two most common are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory phlegm (phlegm), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, bloating, diarrhea, or glaucoma. The World Health Organization (WHO) confirms that nearly one in six people have difficulty breathing.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States has limited the emergency symptoms to difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and blubbering of the face or lips. Immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms occur. Worsening the progression of the disease may lead to acute pneumonia, acute dyspnea, and sepsis.
Some people with no clinical symptoms may not show symptoms, but the results of the tests confirm their injury, so specialists have advised that people in contact with confirmed cases should be monitored and closely examined to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic cases range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the period between infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from 1 to 14 days; it is often five days. As an example of confusion, the proportion of people with COVID-19 who initially lost their sense of smell was estimated at 30%, and the proportion has recently dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spread are still under consideration.
The disease is thought to spread mainly during mixing or by spraying when coughing, sneezing or talking, when mixing at a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without covering the mouth may result in a spray that is scattered from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some argue that the virus may also be transmitted by a spray that is stuck in the air for a long time, which may result during speaking. It may also produce a respiratory spray during the exhalation process, including when speaking, although the virus is not generally airborne.
The spray may fall on the mouths or noses of people nearby or inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be released as a spray and then spread through the air.
It may also spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches one’s eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of spreading from feces to the mouth, this risk is thought to be limited.
The government of China has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from the stool to the mouth. The virus is more contagious during the first three days of symptoms, although it may spread before any symptoms appear and during later stages of the disease.
People have been diagnosed with the disease up to three days before symptoms appear, suggesting that it can be transmitted before severe symptoms appear.
There are few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) confirms that despite some ambiguity about how easily the disease spreads, one person can infect two to three others in general. The virus remains on surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and up to four hours on copper.
However, this varies based on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been confirmed to be infected with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, such as when touching other surfaces that may have been touched by an infected person.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2)-associated coronavirus is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia who were in contact with a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 shares all of its properties with coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, home soap kills the virus, melting its protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is believed to have an animal origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically meets the genus of the coronavirus beta, and falls under the sub-species of the coronavirus sarbei (B strain) in addition to two strains originating from bats.
96% matches the entire genome with other samples of coronaviruses in bats (Pat Cove Rat G13)
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of genome sequences between ants-eating viruses and human-eating viruses.
A comparison of the entire genome to date has resulted in the discovery of a maximum of 92% genetic material involvement between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is insufficient to prove that the termite eater is the intermediate host of the virus.
HIV infection can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately made by the reaction of retrograde polymerase sequences (RT-PCR) to infected secretions or computed tomography.
A study in the city of Wuhan comparing serial polymerase interactions with computed tomography indicated that computed tomography is more sensitive than serial polymerase reactions, although less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interfering with pneumonia and other stages of disease.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use computerized tomography to detect COVID-19 or to consider it as a preliminary examination to diagnose the disease."
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published several protocols for testing SARS-CoV-2 RNA for the first time on January 17.
The test uses a reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be performed on samples of the respiratory system or blood.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
This test is generally done by a nasopharyngeal swab, and a throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them have been proven accurate enough to be widely used.
A serological test developed by Selex has been certified for emergency use in the United States only in accredited laboratories.
The imaging properties of radiographs and CT scans of people with disease symptoms include asymmetric terminal opacity such as stratified glass haze and confused crystal leaching.
The Italian Radiation Society collects an international online database of imaging results for confirmed cases.
Radiography without a polymerase chain reaction is a limited-accuracy procedure for the detection of COVID-19 due to its interference with other diseases such as adenovirus infection.
A large study in China compared the results of CT scans of the chest with polymerase chain reaction and proved that although the imaging is less accurate in terms of evidence of infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting it is a screening tool in infected areas.
Artificial intelligence-based neural networks have been developed to detect virus imaging properties in both radiography and computed tomography.
Strategies to prevent disease transmission include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, washing hands, avoiding contact with the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and using a napkin when coughing or sneezing and then getting rid of it by throwing it directly into the trash.
Those who already have the infection are advised to wear a medical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Several governments have banned unnecessary travel from and to countries and regions affected by the outbreak or advised against travel.
However, the virus has reached the stage of spreading throughout society in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some individuals do not know where or how they were infected. Healthcare providers, who care for a person who is potentially infected, are advised to use appropriate measures and precautions to socialize and protect the eye. Tracking contacts of infected people is an effective way to help health authorities identify the source of infection and prevent its spread.
The use of mobile location data by governments for tracking has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations issuing a statement demanding that such surveillance be restricted.
As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen specialized groups have worked on privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record how close a user is to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they approach a person with confirmed COVID-19. Misconceptions about how to prevent infection are promoted; for example, washing the nose and gargling with a mouthwash is not a viable solution.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19 yet, although many organizations have been working on a vaccine.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when dirty hands appear, before eating, and after emptying the nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because home soap kills the virus outside the body, destroying its protective membrane.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also recommended the use of a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with several disinfectants (within one minute of placing the disinfectant on the surface of stainless steel), including; ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and iodopovidone 0.2–7.5%.
Other antiseptics, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that when a person is suspected of having a COVID or confirmed infection in a facility such as an office or care center, all places such as offices, bathrooms, shared spaces, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by the patient should be sterilized.
Health organizations recommended that people cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing either bend the elbow and place it in front of the mouth and nose or use a paper napkin and get rid of any napkins immediately.
Those who are likely to be injured are recommended to use medical masks, as wearing the mask reduces the size of the respiratory spray and the distance it travels when scattered due to speaking, sneezing and coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “wearing a mask can reduce [people’s] desire to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection if hands are not properly cleaned.” Those who care for people who are potentially sick are recommended to use masks.
The World Health Organization has recommended that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as those taking care of a COVID-19 patient, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun encouraging ordinary people to wear face masks.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing a non-medical face mask made of cloth. China specifically recommended that healthy people use disposable medical masks, especially if they are in direct contact with people (within 1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage individuals to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out to public places without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for anyone entering a grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, has asked commuters on trains and intercity buses to wear masks on April 1.
Panama has made wearing a face mask when going out necessary, while also recommending the manufacture of face masks at home for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control measures aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing mixing between individuals.
Roads include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closure of schools, workplaces, playgrounds, theatres, or shopping malls.
Individuals can apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, exchanging greetings without contact, and physically distancing from others.
Many governments currently impose or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if no COVID-19 outbreak was detected in the region) to 50 people, and 10 people later.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older people and those with chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and weakened immune systems face a heightened risk of developing serious diseases and complications. The CDC advised them to stay home as much as possible in areas of inter-communal disease outbreaks. In late March 2020, the WHO began
The use of the term "social distancing" has led to the suggestion that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to communicate with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during a pandemic.
This includes recommendations to have sex only with someone you live with who is not a carrier of the virus or who has symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have it.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Several governments have imposed or recommended self-quarantine for all populations living in affected areas.
The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those of the most at-risk groups.
Those who have been treated with a person with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region where the infection is widely transmitted have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of another potential exposure.
Outbreak control strategies are containment or suppression and reduction of spread.
Containment is applied in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate infected people as well as introduce other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When containment of the spread of the disease is not possible, efforts are then directed to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
A combination of both containment and mitigation measures can be done at the same time.
Repression requires tougher measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of primary reproductions to less than 1. Part of the management of infectious disease outbreaks attempts to reduce the peak of the epidemic, in what is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of straining health services and provides more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmacological interventions that may address outbreaks include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-quarantine; community actions aimed at physical distancing such as school closures and the cancellation of major gatherings; community solidarity to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning. More stringent measures have been taken to contain outbreaks in China.
Other countries have also taken a variety of measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass checks and local quarantines, and issued alerts on the movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to those injured who isolated themselves and imposed hefty fines for those who did not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and criminalized the hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations of Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing the spread of the epidemic, not halting it) and curbing (reversing the growth of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce peak demand for health care by 2/3 and deaths by half, but they still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and strain on health systems.
Braking may be preferable but should be maintained as long as the virus spreads in humans (or until a vaccine becomes available, if this happens first), as transmission on the other hand bounces off quickly when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to curb the pandemic causes social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may worsen the results.
Many compounds that have been previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are subject to screening for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has also stated that some “traditional and home remedies” can provide relief for symptoms caused by SARS-CoVID-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health care centers to provide for the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as key measures to respond to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) and the WHO European Regional Office for Hospitals and Primary Health Care Services have issued guidelines for the transfer of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating optional procedures where possible, separating and isolating people with COVID-19, and increasing intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of artificial respirators and beds available.
There are multiple theories about where the first condition originated (so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the novel coronavirus may date back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Bhube, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
This was mostly associated with the Wuhan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus came from one of these species of animals; in other words, it has an animal origin. A group with pneumonia was observed for an unknown reason on December 26 and was treated by Dr. Zhang Jishian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported it to the Center for Disease Control.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a SARS-like coronavirus.
Police alerted eight of these doctors, including Li Wen Liang, to spread false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Wen, was reprimanded by her superiors to raise the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on 31 December and informed the WHO.
Sufficient cases of pneumonia unknown to health authorities in Wuhan were reported which prompted them to start the investigation in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus moved to other Chinese provinces, with the help of transportations during the Chinese New Year and Wuhan as a transportation hub and major railway junction point.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data released later show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by January 20, 2020. As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy in the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide, with more than 97,000 people dying and more than 364,000 recovering.
About 200 countries and territories have registered at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted freedom of movement and imposed border controls.
National responses included containment measures, such as quarantine (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter orders, or closures) and curfews. As of 2 April, close to 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, had undergone some form of closure in the United States, more than 50 million people had undergone closures in the Philippines, and some 59 million people had undergone closures in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide underwent one form of closure, rising to 2.6 billion two days later—about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report indicates that the first case was on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jishian noticed a range of pneumonia cases caused by an unknown cause on December 26, and subsequently informed her hospital of the Center for Disease Control in Jianghane, Wuhan, on December 27.
A preliminary genetic test of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31.
WHO was notified on the same day.
In the presence of these notices, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police about "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
China’s National Health Commission initially claimed there was no “clear evidence” of a person-to-person transition.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by Communist Party of China Secretary General Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to contain the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as the "biggest quarantine in human history", a health cordon was announced on January 23 to stop travel to and from Wuhan, extending to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city is prohibited.
Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were cancelled in several places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a makeshift hospital, Hooshinshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital, Lichenshan Hospital, was then built to deal with additional patients.
In addition to the newly established hospitals, China has also turned 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into makeshift hospitals. On January 26, the government took other measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including providing health announcements to travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools are also closed across the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have taken several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Teleworking measures have been taken in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were imposed inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified, and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
Control of public movement has been tightened in several cities, and it is estimated that around 760 million people (more than half the population) have been subjected to some form of exit restriction. After the outbreak became global in March, Chinese authorities took drastic measures to prevent the virus from being “brought” to them from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all returnees to the city from other countries. On 23 March, one case was transmitted locally in mainland China over the past five days, via a passenger returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang stated that the prevalence of locally transmitted infections and the control of the outbreak in China had eased.
Travel restrictions in Hubei eased on the same day, with the exception of Wuhan, two months after the closure was imposed. China's Foreign Ministry announced on 26 March 2020 that visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March onwards, with no specific details on when this policy would end.
Those who wish to enter China will have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government has urged companies and factories to resume work on March 30, and has introduced a monetary incentive package for companies. The State Council has declared a three-minute day of mourning that begins with a silence on April 4 at 10:00, coinciding with the Qing Ming Festival, although the central government has demanded that families show their respect online for physical distancing to avoid a COVID-19 outbreak again.
COVID-19 transmission from China to South Korea was confirmed on January 20, 2020.
The National Health Agency announced a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely due to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Shincheongji Jesus.
Shincheongji followers visiting Daegu from Wuhan are suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, 1,261 people, or about 13% of 9,336 church followers, had reported symptoms. South Korea announced the highest levels of preparedness on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed three soldiers were infected with the virus.
Flight schedules were also affected, so they changed. South Korea implemented a program that was considered the largest and best organized in the world to screen people for the virus, isolate any infected people, track their contacts and quarantine them.
The screening methods included mandatory personal reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via the mobile app, testing people inside their cars with test results available the next day, and increasing testing capabilities to 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program represents a success in controlling the outbreak although quarantines have not been applied to entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either calling for Moon’s removal, alleging the government’s mishandling of the outbreak, or praising his response.
On March 23, it was announced that South Korea had the lowest total cases in a single day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that as of 1 April all new arrivals from abroad would be subject to quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests from 121 different countries to help test for the virus.
Iran reported its first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 on February 19 in Qom, where two people died later the same day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, institutes of higher education, and schools.
Iran has allocated 5 trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani stated on 26 February 2020 that there is no plan to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals will be isolated.
Plans to reduce inter-city travel were announced in March, although heavy inter-city traffic continued before the Persian New Year.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran during February became a hub for the spread of the virus after China.
Amid allegations of Iran’s cover-up over its outbreak, more than a dozen countries have tracked their Iran-return cases since Feb. 28, suggesting the extent of the outbreak could exceed the 388 reported by the Iranian government to date.
Iran’s parliament has been shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reported to have been infected with the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, as well as temporarily release eligible prisoners.
There is a high risk of the virus spreading indoors, such as in detention facilities, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government announced 100 deaths in one day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
At least 12 Iranian politicians and current and former government officials are dying of the disease by March 17.
By 23 March, Iran was registering 50 new cases per hour, and one death every ten minutes from the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, the number of cases in Iran could be as high as five times as many as reported.
It is also believed that U.S. sanctions on Iran may affect the state’s financial capacity to respond to the outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the easing of economic sanctions on countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak in Italy was confirmed on January 31, when SARS-CoV-2 tests for Chinese tourists in Rome came positive.
Cases began to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unrelated group of COVID-19 cases was later discovered, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree with a new law to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, “It will not be allowed into or out of the outbreak areas.
He was already ordered to suspend work activities and sporting events in those areas.” On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country with 100 deaths in Italy.
All major sporting events, including First Division football matches, were scheduled to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March, all sporting events were fully suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesics, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding screening protocols that could be used.
On 19 March, Italy surpassed China as the country with the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after 3,405 pandemic deaths were reported.
On 22 March, Russia sent nine military aircraft carrying medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, most of them in the Lombardy region.
A combination of a large number of older people and the inability to test all people infected with the virus so far in Italy may have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as the most lax among affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the UK government has not imposed any form of social distancing or blanket quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has received criticism for its perceived lack of speed and intensity in responding to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement advising against unnecessary travel or social contact, suggesting people work from home as much as possible and avoid several places, such as bars, restaurants, and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that it would close all recreational facilities such as bars and gyms as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a maximum of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to reduce unemployment at the time of the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent social distancing measures, banning gatherings of more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activity except for exigency.
Contrary to previous measures, these restrictions were implemented by the police by issuing fines and dispersing gatherings.
Most companies, with the exception of “necessary” businesses, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and garages, have been ordered to close.
On January 20, the first known case of COVID-19 in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington was confirmed by a man returning from Wuhan on January 15.
The White House coronavirus task force was set up on January 29.
On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency, and imposed restrictions on the entry of travelers from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the U.S. government’s leading public health institute, announced that it had developed its own testing suite.
Despite doing so, the U.S. has been slow to start testing, blocking the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
The test spoiled a flawed test set produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government approval of non-state test kits (by academia, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for people to qualify for the test until early March (a doctor's order was required thereafter).
By February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
By March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: "Many people who had symptoms and had a doctor's order waited hours or days for testing." After reporting the first death in the United States in Washington state on February 29, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, a measure soon followed by other states.
Schools in Seattle cancelled schooling on March 3, and by mid-March, schools across the country were closed. On March 6, 2020, the United States was informed of projections regarding the impact of the novel coronavirus on the country by epidemiologists at Imperial College London.
On the same day, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplementary Appropriations Act, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding to federal agencies to respond to the outbreak.
Companies imposed travel restrictions on employees, canceled conferences, and urged employees to work from home.
Sports activities and seasons were cancelled. On March 11, Trump announced travel restrictions for most of Europe, with the exception of the United Kingdom, for 30 days, effective March 13.
The following day, the restrictions were extended to include the UK and Ireland.
On 13 March, a national emergency was declared, which allowed federal funds to be used to respond to the crisis.
As of March 15, many companies have closed or reduced their operating hours across the United States in an effort to curb the spread of the virus.
By 17 March, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia. On 23 March, 10,700 coronavirus cases were reported in New York City, more than the total number of cases in South Korea.
On 25 March, the governor said social distancing appeared to be a success, with estimates showing cases doubling from 2.0 days to 4.7 days slower.
As of 28 March, there were 32,308 confirmed cases in New York City, and 672 people died from the virus. On 26 March, more confirmed cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of 8 April, 400,335 cases were confirmed in the United States, and 12,841 people died.
According to media reports on March 30, U.S. President Trump decided to extend social distancing directives until April 30.
On the same day, USNS Comfort, a hospital ship with about 1,000 beds, docked in New York.
On April 3, the United States recorded 884 coronavirus deaths in 24 hours.
In New York State the number of cases exceeded 100,000 on April 3. The White House was criticized for underestimating the threat and controlling the circulation of news by directing health officials and scientists to coordinate public statements and publications related to the virus with Vice President Mike Pence's office.
The Trump administration’s crisis has not been universally praised as it has caused widespread polarization among parties.
Some U.S. officials and commentators have criticized the U.S. reliance on imports of essential materials, including essential medical supplies, from China.
The analysis of air travel patterns was used to map and predict proliferation patterns and was published in the Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
Based on information from the International Air Transport Association 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei had the largest number of passengers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne have also been reported as popular destinations for travellers from Wuhan.
Bali was reported to be the least able of the more than 20 popular destinations in terms of preparedness, while cities in Australia were considered the most capable. Australia released its emergency response plan for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on 7 February.
Not much has been discovered about COVID-19, and Australia will stress border control and communications in its response to the pandemic.
On 21 March, a Human Biosecurity Emergency was declared in Australia.
As public transport is affected by the effective quarantine in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries have planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic staff from the region, primarily through charter flights from their home countries, with Chinese authorities providing permits.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first countries to plan to evacuate their citizens.
Pakistan has said it will not deport any of its citizens from China.
On 7 February, Brazil evacuated 34 Brazilians or family members as well as four Poles, a Chinese person, and an Indian citizen.
Polish, Chinese and Indian citizens disembarked from the plane in Poland, where the Brazilian plane stopped before resuming its route to Brazil.
Brazilian citizens who went to Wuhan were isolated at a military base near Brasilia.
On the same day, 215 Canadians (176 of the first aircraft, and 39 of the second aircraft chartered by the U.S. government) were evacuated from Wuhan to Canadian forces base Trenton for two weeks.
On 11 February, another aircraft carrying 185 Canadians landed from Wuhan at Canadian Forces Base Trenton.
Australian authorities evacuated 277 citizens on February 3 and 4 to the Christmas Island Detention Center, which was reused as a quarantine facility, where they stayed for 14 days.
A New Zealand evacuation flight arrived in Auckland on 5 February, and its passengers (including people from Australia and the Pacific) were quarantined at a naval base in Wanjabarawa in northern Auckland.
On February 15, the United States announced that it would evacuate the Americans who were on board the cruise ship Diamond Princess.
On 21 February, a plane landed in Trenton, Ontario carrying 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess.
In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, a South African Airlines plane chartered by the South African government repatriated 112 South African citizens.
A pre-departure medical check-up was conducted, and four South Africans who showed signs of coronavirus were left to mitigate the risk.
South Africans whose test results were only negative were returned.
The test results showed that South Africans, including the flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, all of whom, as a precaution, remained under surveillance and quarantine at the Ranch resort for 14 days, were uninjured.
On March 20, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.
On 5 February, the Chinese Foreign Ministry reported that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt, and Iran) had sent aid to China.
Some Chinese students at U.S. universities banded together to send aid to areas infected with the virus in China, and a joint group in the Greater Chicago area reportedly managed to send 50,000 N95 masks to hospitals in Hubei province on January 30. Direct Relief, in coordination with FedEx, sent 200,000 face masks with other personal protective equipment, including gloves and hospital staff clothing, to the hospital by June.
On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to the World Health Organization to fund vaccine research and treatment efforts, along with the protection of “at-risk populations in Africa and South Asia.”
The Chinese government donated 200,000 masks to the Philippines on February 6, after Sen. Richard Gordon shipped 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.
On 19 February, the Singapore Red Cross announced that it would send China $2.26 million in aid.
Japan donated 1 million face masks to Wuhan, Turkey sent medical equipment, Russia sent more than 13 tons of medical supplies to Wuhan, Malaysia announced 18 million medical gloves to China, Germany handed over several medical supplies including 10,000 protective suits, and the United States pledged 17.8 tons of medical supplies to China.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medical supplies and experts to help Italy deal with its coronavirus outbreak.
Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million face masks and 60,000 protective suits to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where they were distributed by the African Union.
He later sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 face masks and 5 artificial respirators to Panama.
Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic expressed concern about masks and test kits made in China.
For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 test kits for the coronavirus made in China that were only 30% accurate, and in the meantime, the Netherlands returned 600,000 defective face masks made in China.
Belgium returned 100,000 unusable face masks that were thought to be from China, but were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, parts of Latin America and Africa welcomed Chinese aid well received. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containing the epidemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) noted the difference between the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004, where Chinese authorities were accused of blackout that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government provided “regular updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday.”
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement the ban on public transport in Wuhan, WHO representative Guden Ghalia noted that while this was "not certainly a recommendation made by the World Health Organization", it was a "very important indicator of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated", describing it as "unprecedented in the history of public health". On 30 January, after the confirmation of the move from one person to another outside China, the number of cases increased.
The WHO Director-General said that considering the outbreak a public health emergency is of international concern due to “the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries that do not have strong health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that “there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade” and that “the WHO does not recommend limiting trade and mobility.”
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the international community to contribute $675 million to strategic funds in low-income countries, citing the urgent need to support those countries that “don’t have systems to detect people living with HIV, even if it appears.”
Tedros also made statements in which he declared that "our strength is measured by the strength of the weakest person in us" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay a high price later". On February 11, the World Health Organization called the disease, at a press conference, the name COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros reported that UN Secretary-General Ant<0xC3><0xB3>nio Guterres had agreed to offer “the potential of the entire UN system in response.”
As a result, a UN crisis management team has been set up, which has allowed the coordination of the entire UN response, and WHO will allow it to “focus on the health response while leveraging the expertise of other agencies to learn about the broader social, economic, and development impacts of the outbreak.”
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team was prepared with China to provide international experts and WHO experts on the ground in China to assist in local management and assess the "intensity of the disease and its transmissionability" by hosting workshops and meetings with key national institutions, and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and city level, including urban and rural areas". On 25 February, WHO announced that "the world should be prepared for"
In response to the outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would rise from “high” to “very high”, its highest level of warning and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization’s health emergency program, said: “This is a real test for every government on earth: so we have to be prepared.
“This virus may be on its way and you have to prepare for it,” he urged taking the right response measures that can help the world avoid “the worst.”
Ryan also stated that current data do not justify public health officials declaring the disease a global pandemic, saying such an announcement means “we fundamentally accept that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus.”
On 11 March, the World Health Organization declared a coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic.
The Director-General said that the WHO is “deeply concerned by the alarming levels of prevalence, severity, and alarming levels of inaction.” The WHO has faced severe criticism for what is seen as an inadequate response to the pandemic, including the delayed declaration of a public health emergency, and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The backlash included a petition by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts affirmed respect for the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and the government bears this responsibility.
The group stressed that a lack of resources or health insurance should not be a justification for discrimination against a particular group.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, members of minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in very poor conditions, detainees, as well as refugees and other non-specific groups in need of government support.
Intergovernmental organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as perspectives and advice.
From policies to strengthening health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of closures and travel restrictions, the digital hub includes a state policy tracking tool, which aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove, and Edward Bolsonaro, the son of Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro, over its handling of the pandemic, which began in China’s Hubei Province.
Several directors of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been dismissed at a multi-sector level for their handling of quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of discontent with the political establishment’s response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe the move was aimed at protecting Communist Party of China (CPC) Secretary General Xi Jinping from public discontent over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example Zhao Lijian, have rejected an earlier recognition that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories claimed by the United States or Italy regarding COVID-19.
The Donald Trump administration has called the coronavirus a “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus,” saying that China has “imposed a blackout on the news that has exacerbated the virus that is now a global pandemic,” which some critics have criticized for being racist and “dismissing [attention] from his administration’s failure to contain the disease.”
The Daily Beast obtained a U.S. government cable reviewing the National Security Council’s clear-source communications blueprint, with a strategy statement that “it’s all about China.
We were asked to seek and publish these messages in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. “News sources such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China’s efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda push for global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned of a “geographical political component that includes a struggle for influence through the practice of circumvention and generosity policies.”
Borrell also said that “China is strongly pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China has also called on the United States to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
U.S. sanctions banned Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba on April 3.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of diverting aid that was destined for other countries to their home countries.
There have been mask-related disputes reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of artificial respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU’s lack of solidarity with coronavirus-affected Italy.
Mauritou Masari, Italy’s ambassador to the European Union, said: “It is China that has responded only at the bilateral level.
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military to send military medics, special clearance vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
Italy’s La Stampa newspaper quoted an unnamed “high-level political source” as saying that 80 percent of Russia’s aid was “useless or of little use to Italy.”
The source accused Russia of launching a "geographical and diplomatic" attack.
Lombardi’s president, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the press reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “when providing assistance to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are active again, they will also be able to repay if necessary.”
NATO’s planned “Defenders 2020” military exercises will take place in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War on a small scale.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the 2020 gun training, saying, “In the current public health crisis, the training is putting not only the lives of troops from the United States and many participating European countries at risk but also the populations of the countries where it will take place.” The Iranian government has been deeply affected by the virus, with about twenty members of parliament infected as well as fifteen other former or current political figures.
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on March 14, 2020 asking for help, saying that his country is struggling to combat the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts predicted that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan's "mysterious and negative quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be quarantined at certain government sites for two weeks.
South Korean society was initially polarized by President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be impeached for allegedly mishandling or praising the government for responding to the outbreak. The pandemic has allowed states to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concerns that this could allow governments to tighten their grip on power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n to rule by decree indefinitely, suspending parliament as well as elections and punishing those who spread false information about the virus and the government’s handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several supply shortages due to the increasing global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic buying, and disruption of factory operations and logistics.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and a halt in suppliers.
Many areas have also seen panic buying, resulting in shelves free of basic grocery items such as food, toilet paper, and water bottles, causing shortages of supplies.
The tech industry in particular has warned of delays in shipments of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand caused prices to rise by up to twenty times the normal price and also caused medical supplies to be delayed for between four and six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protection tools around the world, with the World Health Organization warning that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has created a new opportunity for Diago shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity led to a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite the widespread spread of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent high demand for food products, the two regions survived severe food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy to combat the storage and illicit trafficking of vital products have succeeded in averting the expected severe food shortages in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy has not seen a significant decline in its agricultural output, but prices may rise according to expectations from industry representatives.
Food shelves were temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure adequate nutrition for residents.
Similar laws exist in Italy requiring food producers to keep stocks for such emergencies.
China has felt the damage to the global economy: According to a media report on March 16, the Chinese economy was severely damaged in the first two months of 2020 due to government actions to curb the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As mainland China is a major economic and industrial hub, the outbreak of the virus has been noted as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agatha DeMares of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that markets would remain volatile until a clearer picture of the likely outcome emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed that of the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimated that the global supply chain was affected by more than $300 billion, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to have experienced "disruption" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to falling demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on Feb. 24 due to a dramatic rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indexes, including the Nasdaq-100, the Standard & Poor's 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded their biggest decline since 2008, with Dow dropping 1,191 points, its biggest one-day decline since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
The three indicators ended the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GMPH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained negative expectations.
Stocks fell again due to fears of the coronavirus, and the biggest drop was on March 16.
Many believe that a recession is possible.
Economist Mohammed Al-Erian praised the emergency measures taken by central banks and countries in a timely manner.
Central banks respond faster than they did under the 2008 financial meltdown.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by the travel ban, the closure of public places including tourist attractions, and the warning of governments against travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British regional airline, Flyby, collapsed.
The impact on the cruise line industry has been at an unprecedented level.
Many train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Spring Festival travel season known as Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
National and regional governments have cancelled a number of events with large crowds, including New Year’s celebrations, with private companies also independently closing their stores and tourist attractions such as Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent large gatherings, including Beijing’s Forbidden City and traditional temple exhibitions.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, and in municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, and instructed most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled New Year's celebrations. The retail sector globally has been affected by reduced store hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a decline of between 50 and 60%.
This also led to a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Operators of shopping malls around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increasing hygiene, installing thermal scanners to check shoppers’ temperature, and canceling events. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's roughly 300 million rural migrant workers were trapped in their homes in the Inner Provinces, or Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The shutdown in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid through daily wages) unemployed. A survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households in mid-2020 had experienced some form of unemployment closure.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany sent their workers into government-backed short-term business plans known as Kurz<0xC3><0xA4>rbeit.
France and Britain adopted the German short-term work compensation plan.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as individuals – workers and independents – globally.
The arts and culture sector organizations have sought to support their mission (often funded by the government) to provide access to the cultural heritage of the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, venues and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, there have been intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Other recent, accelerated consequences of the disease include the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals, concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered a hiatus. The Vatican announced the cancellation of Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Christian Lent season.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home instead of attending Mass on Sundays, with some churches making church services available via radio, live streaming or television while others offer worship without leaving their cars.
With the Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels, and St. Peter's Square evacuating Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also abolished limited public services and gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and Gurdwara.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak were cancelled and the shrines were then closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the biggest disruption to the global sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the 2020 European Championship, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 National Hockey League season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to start at the end of July, and the IOC announced on 24 March that the event would "reschedul beyond 2020 but no later than the summer of 2021".
This has led many gamblers to move to online gaming, with many online gambling sites reporting significant increases in new subscription rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with different music groups suspending or cancelling concert tours.
Many large theaters such as those on Broadway have suspended all performances as well.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue producing and sharing work online as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live-streaming concerts or creating online “celebrations” for artists to perform, distribute and publish their work.
Many Internet memes about the coronavirus have spread on the Internet, with many turning to humor and entertainment in the face of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, extreme prejudice, xenophobia and racism have been observed towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports released in February (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed by different groups around the world towards the Chinese that they deserved the virus or received what was claimed to be justified punishment.
Anti-Chinese sentiment has also seen a rise in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination due to their regional origin.
There has been support for Chinese both online and offline, and for those living in areas affected by the virus.
After the outbreak has spread to new hotspots, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, could be subject to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed petitions for pressure to prevent Chinese from entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan is on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the UK and US have reported increasing levels of racist abuse, as well as assaults.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as "Chinese virus," a term critics have deemed racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine have attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners being evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzari.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, who study in major Indian cities, have faced harassment due to the coronavirus outbreak.
The head of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unit in West Bengal state, Dilip Ghosh, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them".
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later condemned the remarks, calling them “wrong.” In China, the pandemic has led to growing xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, with foreigners being described as “foreign garbage” and targeted for “disposal.”
Many newspapers have removed paid-for pages for some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers related to the outbreak available for open access.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share their results on pre-print servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes ways to detect the presence of the virus as it recognizes antibodies that produce a response to infection.
RT-PCR confirms the presence of viruses in the samples, where it detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is accurate and designed only to detect the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active cases of infection.
Antibody detection (serumology) is used to diagnose and monitor the population.
Antibody tests show how many people have contracted the disease, including those whose symptoms were too simple to report or who did not have symptoms.
The exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of mass immunity among the population can be determined based on the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country in March 2020 had reliable data on the spread of the virus among its population.
On 23 March, no country examined more than 3% of its population, and there is considerable variation in the number of tests conducted by different countries.
This discrepancy is also likely to have a significant impact on reported case mortality rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the RRT-PCR polymerase reaction, an examination can be performed on respiratory samples obtained in various ways, including the nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR, which is performed using throat swabs, is only reliable in the first week of illness.
The virus may then disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people who are examined in the second week, a sample of deep airways can instead be taken by suction catheterization or using coughing (phlegm) material.
One of the early PCR tests at the Charit<0xC3><0xA9> in Berlin was invented in January 2020 using the reverse transcript intraday polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and formed the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on January 23, 2020.South Korean company Kogenebiotech has also created a SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus) detection kit suitable for safe clinical use and based on PCR on January 28, 2020.
Looking for the "E" gene in which all of the SARS-CoV-2 public RdRp and SARS-CoV-2 public RdRp viruses are shared. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China's National Medical Products Administration for SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes dashboard
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits resulted in inconclusive results due to faulty reagents, and one stage of testing was delayed compared to the other at CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully tested throughout the entire month of February 2020.
Tests using two components did not gain confidence until February 28, 2020, and until then, state and local laboratories were not allowed to begin testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories in the United States began conducting the tests in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, Lab Corp announced the availability of COVID-19 testing across the country based on RT-PCR.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made it possible to test COVID-19 across the country as of March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been announced; the sampling process must be performed and processed in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the State Center for Research in Virology and Biotechnology Victor invented the COVID-19 test and produced it.
On February 11, 2020, the Federal Service for Healthcare Supervision registered the test. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics obtained FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours in large numbers, allowing one machine to conduct approximately 4,128 tests over a 24-hour range.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the m2000 Abbott system; the FDA had previously granted a similar authorization to Logic, LapCorp, and Thermo Fischer Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Seyved obtained a similar emergency use permit from the Food and Drug Administration in favor of a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved a test that uses a technology that inflates even-temperature DNA instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a series of successive temperature cycles, this method can show positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the United States and Abbott expects to ramp up manufacturing to 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is also developing a test that uses a monoclonal antibody that is specifically linked to the novel coronavirus’s nuclear capsid protein (NCP), hoping to be able to achieve results within 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid flu test.
A review of studies in March 2020 concluded that "breast radial images have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT results may be apparent even before symptoms appear."
The usual characteristics that appear in computerized tomography include bilobular sanded glass opacities with an asymmetrical and rear distribution.
Prevalence develops under the pleura, irregular patches appear and intensify as the disease progresses.
A study in Wuhan comparing PCR and computed tomography in relation to the origin of the current pandemic suggested that computerized tomography is more sensitive than PCR, though less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interfering with pneumonia and other disease stages.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use computerized tomography to detect COVID-19 or to consider it as a preliminary examination to diagnose the disease." In March 2020, CDC recommends using PCR for initial examination.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect infection in individuals within a period of 7 days or after the onset of symptoms, to determine immune capacity, and in the case of population monitoring. Analyses can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by a clinical point-of-care (PCT) test.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the rate of production per system.
For central laboratories, a single sample of peripheral blood cells is usually used, although consecutive samples can be used to follow up the immune response.
For a clinical point-of-care test, a single blood sample is usually drawn by perforating the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, the extraction step is not required prior to screening. On 26 March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified 29 entities that had notified the agency in accordance with the requirements and were able to distribute their antibody tests.
On 7 April 2020, the FDA approved only one test under emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European accreditations for their testing kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
The test performs several hundred samples in a matter of hours and is therefore much faster than conventional PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can often be detected 14 days after the start of infection. In April, the UK discovered that the antibody testing kits it bought were not good enough to be used.
Hong Kong has developed a plan under which suspected patients can stay at home, “give the emergency department a sample tube for the patients”, spit in the tube, and return it to get the test result after a little while. The NHS has announced that it is testing a plan to test suspected cases at home, thus excluding the risk of transmission from the infected when they come to the hospital or need a vehicle.
In-vehicle screening centres have enabled South Korea to conduct some of the world’s fastest and most comprehensive tests. In Germany, the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it was able to conduct around 12,000 outpatient tests per day and 10,700 people underwent testing last week.
Health insurance will bear the costs if a doctor orders the test.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of about 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, in-vehicle virus detection tests were made available in several major cities.
On 26 March 2020 the total number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown, as only positive case results were announced.
A preliminary laboratory study revealed that starting from the same calendar week <0xE7><0x9C><0x9F>2020, at least 483,295 samples had been tested in the same test-day as in the same test-day. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital have devised a method for testing samples taken from 64 samples.
With BGI’s founder, Wang Jian, overseeing construction and taking 5 days to do so, the modelling showed that cases in Hubei would have risen by 47% and the associated quarantine costs would have doubled if that testing capability had not been completed.
Wuhan Lab has immediately followed the establishment of Huo-Yan Labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai and in a total of 12 cities across China.
By March 4, 2020, the total daily productivity was 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays has released open-source, multi-transmission designs that can test up to 1,122 patient samples to detect COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need for automated fluid processors.
In March, a lack of and insufficient reagents caused a stalemate when a large number of tests were carried out in the EU, the UK and the US.
This led some specialists to explore sampling protocols that involved heating samples at 98<0xC2><0xB0>C (208<0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the UAE was at the top of the world in terms of the percentage of its population tested for coronavirus, and was on track to raise the level of testing to reach the majority of the population.
This was through a combination of activating in-car testing capability, and purchasing a high-throughput lab with a population-friendly range from Group 42 and BGI (depending on their Huo-Yan emergency detection labs in China).
The lab was set up within 14 days, allowing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the world’s first lab of this size to operate outside of China.
Various test methods have been devised to target different parts of the coronavirus’ genetic traits in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted a German plan to manufacture crews sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to create their own crews.
The German plan was announced on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until January 28, which delayed tests available in the U.S. China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet demand and follow the recommendations of testing by health experts.
In contrast, experts have said that the abundance of tests in South Korea has helped limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has greatly enhanced testing capacity in private sector laboratories over several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for intensifying testing programs as the best solution to curb the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic.The increased demand for testing as a result of the widespread spread of the virus has caused hundreds of thousands of tests to accumulate in private American laboratories, and has also depleted supplies of swabs and chemical reagents.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, there were “flaws” in CDC’s test kits; the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented testing in particular. Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Limited, but found the results to be inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results may be due to the failure to collect the samples or to the failure to use the crews correctly.
The Spanish ministry has stated that it will back off the purchase of the crews that gave incorrect results, and will replace them with other test crews from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test crews bought by the Czech Republic from China gave wrong results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x87> proposed dumping it on the Danube. Prof. A<0xC4><0x9F> Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health reported that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a “high error rate” and were “banned for use”. The UK also bought 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 declared them unusable.
The tests, which were followed by a quarantine for those who were found to be infected and followed up with those who had contacts with SARS-CoV-2, yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Fo, which saw the first death from COVID-19 in Italy, tested the entire population of about 3,400 twice, taking about 10 days at a time.
Almost half of the people tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases were isolated.
As a result of the ban on commuting between towns, new infections were completely eliminated.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore saw a significant reduction in the prevalence rate compared to other developed countries, but without strict restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and retail establishments, through strict contact tracing and restrictions on domestic travel, testing and quarantine.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has already begun urging residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 on time after the holiday ended.
Several other countries have also controlled the pandemic by strictly tracking contacts and imposing restrictions on domestic travel, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent closure decisions, such as in Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has revealed that countries with more tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower case mortality rates, perhaps because these countries are better able to detect those with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to take tests or have local laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 send the first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO-approved laboratories to confirm the test.
Of the 16 accredited laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the “positive % of tests” column is influenced by the policy of the state in conducting the test.
A country that only tests people who are hospitalized will have positive cases that are up to a percentage higher than the country that tests all of its residents, whether they have symptoms or not, considering the equality of other factors.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand washing, is the process of cleaning hands for the purpose of removing dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly at certain “necessary times” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the oral anal route.
People can also develop respiratory diseases such as flu or colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five necessary moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby’s butt or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating, before preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry and after.
If soap and water are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after food preparation.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing or cleaning the diapers of a child after using the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, cough, or sneeze.
After touching the animals, their feed, or their excrement.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medication or providing medical care can prevent or limit the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who are dealing with food or working in the medical field, but it is also an important procedure for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases, preventing infectious diseases that cause diarrhea, and reducing respiratory infections.
Infant mortality rates at home have been reduced.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand washing practices may lead to minor improvements in height growth in children under five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Measures that encourage hand washing can reduce bouts of diarrhoea by nearly a third, similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of low-diarrheal episodes can be associated with handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the single most effective and least expensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI) when applying spontaneous behavior in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main acute respiratory infections, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, killing about 1.8 million children a year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause about 3.5 million children to die each year.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an ingrained habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other hygiene measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (water, sanitation and hygiene) programs.
Hand washing also protects against herpes transmitted through direct physical contact.
For hand washing a simple harmful effect is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to dryness.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition of peeling and itching known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health care workers.
Washing hands too often is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five essential moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the transmission of diseases through the oral anal route: after using the bathroom (urination, stooling), after cleaning the baby's butt (change diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating, and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Proper hand washing should be practiced in other cases in order to prevent the transmission of the disease, including before or after treatment of a cut or wound, after sneezing or coughing or cleaning your nose, after touching or handling animal waste, and after touching the garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7% of families wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia has the highest rate of 97 percent, the United States is 77 percent closer to the middle, and China has the lowest of 23 percent. There are now several behaviour change methodologies in countries to increase the use of hand washing behavior with soap at the necessary times.
The Philippine Department of Education’s “Basic Health Care Program” is an example of widespread action to promote children’s health and education.
Treatment of worms twice a year, in addition to daily hand washing with soap, and daily cleaning of teeth with fluoride, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergent to the water promotes the removal of microorganisms from the skin.
The main effect of soaps and detergents is to reduce the obstructions of dissolution, increasing the solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective antiseptic for the skin because fats and proteins, the components of organic soil, do not easily decompose in water.
However, the flow of an appropriate amount of water helps to cleanse.
Hard soap, due to its reusable nature, may carry bacteria acquired from previous uses.
A few studies that have observed bacterial transmission from contaminated solid soap have concluded that transmission is unlikely because bacteria are washed away with foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to state that “liquid soap is preferred to be used by devices that operate without touching to pump soap.”
Antibacterial soap has been widely promoted to health-conscious consumers.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or sterilizers recommended is chosen to eliminate antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which does not affect a large number of strains of organisms.
So, if antibacterial soap does not affect antibiotic-resistant strains, it may not be as effective as it is marketed.
Besides the surface tension reducer and skin protection agent, advanced formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a regulator of acidity, active anti-microbial benzoic acid and other skin moisturizers (cereals, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).
Hot water suitable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, warm water and soap are more effective than cold water and soap in removing natural oils that retain dust and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect in reducing microbial load on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a substance that is not water-based to clean hands.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol hand sanitizers that were not water-based and sterilized via rubbing (also known as alcohol-based hand lotion, hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for ease of use and reduce the effect of alcohol-induced dehydration.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing alcohol by at least 60 to 95% are effective bactericides.
Alcoholic sterilisation via rubbing eliminates bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory syncytial virus, nasal viruses, alveolar, influenza, and hepatitis).
Alcoholic sterilizers containing 70% alcohol through rubbing eliminate 99.997% (logarithmic reduction by 3.5, similar to a decibel reduction by 35) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after placement and 99.999% to 99.999% (logarithmic reduction of 4 to 5) of bacteria on the hands after 1 minute of placement.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against noroviruses (or norowalk), which is the most common cause of gastroenteritis caused by infection. You should use enough hand sanitizer or rubbing alcohol to completely wet or cover both hands.
The front and back of the hands and between all fingers and limbs are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel is dry.
Fingertips should also be thoroughly washed, rubbing in both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands with a hand sanitizer scrub, especially when your hands are clearly dirty.
The increased use of these detergents is due to their ease of use and rapid activity in the elimination of microorganisms; however, they should not be a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcoholic hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients, skin moisturizers, or both are added to the formulation.
The effect of alcohol on dry skin can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin, other emollients, or both to the formula.
Clinical trials have shown that alcohol hand sanitizers containing emollients cause less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Atopic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives found in alcohol hand lotions are rare.
The reduced susceptibility of irritable contact dermatitis has become a pull factor compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Despite the effectiveness of detergents that are not water-based, they do not cleanse the hands of organic substances, but simply sterilize them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer is highly dependent on the ingredients and composition, and historically, its effect has been significantly less than that of alcohol-containing and rubbing alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have a cumulative and persistent antimicrobial effect after use, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to be less effective after repeated use, possibly due to progressive skin reactions.
Many individuals in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ash or dirt instead.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than water alone, but it may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if dirt or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, they may increase the spread of the disease rather than decrease it.
Ash, like soap, is also a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when it comes into contact with water.
The World Health Organization has recommended using ash or sand as a substitute for soap when it is not available.
The correct hand washing method recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
It is recommended to use running water because existing basins may be contaminated, and at the same time the temperature of the water does not seem to make a difference.
Make a foam on the hands by rubbing them with an ample amount of soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands well when using soap instead of just water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubs create friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and scrubs for longer periods remove more germs.
Rinse well under running water.
Rinseing the hands inside the pelvis may lead to re-contamination.
Dry with a clean towel or leave to dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands are easily contaminated again. The most commonly overlooked parts are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish may contain micro-organisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizing lotion to prevent dry hands, dry skin can damage it which may increase the risk of transmission.
Various low-cost options can be provided to facilitate hand washing in developing countries, where tap water or soap or both are not available, such as pouring water from a suspended pot or banging with suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary. In places with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to rationalize water consumption, such as a "tap tap" and other low-cost options.
A tap tap is a simple technique that uses a pitcher hanging by a rope, a foot-operated control arm to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of hand hygiene, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing number of research suggests that paper towels are healthier than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study, sponsored by the European Textile Symposium for the Paper Towel Industry, to compare the levels of hygiene provided by paper towels, hand dryers with warm air, and hand dryers with newer jet air.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average on the soles of the fingers by 194% and on the palms by 254%.
Drying with a jet air dryer increased the average total number of bacteria on the soles of the fingers by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on average on the soles of the fingers decreased by up to 76% and on the palms by 77%, and scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a possibility of transmission to other users of the water cycle and the water cycle environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which propels air out of the unit at speeds of up to 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of inflating microorganisms from the hands and device, and may transmit the infection to other users of the water cycle and the water cycle environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of a warm air dryer spreads microorganisms 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show any significant proliferation of microorganisms. In 2005, a study by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt evaluated methods of drying different hands.
The following changes in bacterial numbers were observed after drying hands:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers are compared with paper towels.
Hand washing with hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative during travel due to the lack of soap and water.
Alcoholic hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Agnes Simmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if forgotten.
One study found lower rates of infection with its use.
Medical hand washing is for at least 15 seconds, using copious amounts of soap and water or gel to make foam and rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed together and fingers tangled.
If there is dirt under the fingernails, a coarse-haired brush can be used to remove them.
Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse them thoroughly and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to seal the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This avoids contaminating the hands again from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in a health care setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("spores") and avoid their transport.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that not washing hands remains at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, which transmits microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has published a paper detailing how hands are washed and rubbed in health care sectors.
The draft hand hygiene guidance document submitted by the organization can also be found on its website available for public comment.
Whitby and others conducted a related review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if required to demonstrate compliance with regulations.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has “Five Moments” to Wash Hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
before the sterilization mission, and
After taking care of patients. Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap ("medical" or "antimicrobial") adds a pesticide to the hand washing agent.
This genitourinary element may be desirable before surgery or in places where antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent. When rubbing someone's hands for surgery, it is necessary to provide a tap that can be turned on and off without touching them with the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine lotion, sterile hand-drying towels after washing, and a sterile scrubbing brush for the scalp.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2 to 6 minutes.
A long scrub (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When rinsing, water should be prevented from bouncing from the forearms to the hands.
After washing hands, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after taking care of a sick person.
To control staphylococcus infection in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit from manual cleansing came from the first 20% of washing, and that it gained very little additional benefit when the frequency of hand washing increased to more than 35%.
Regular soap washing results in more than three times the rate of bacterial infections that are transmitted to food compared to anti-bacterial soap washing. Comparing rubbing hands with an alcohol solution with washing hands with antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds, rubbing alcohol has been found to reduce bacterial contamination by 26% more than with antibacterial soap.
But water and soap are more effective than alcohol handwashing to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and the difficult spores of the hands. Measures to improve hand hygiene in health care settings may include educating employees about hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol hand washing, and written and oral reminders for employees.
More research is needed to find out which of these measures is most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, it is recognized that handwashing with soap is an essential tool at an affordable cost to achieve good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, a lack of reliable water supplies, soap, or handwashing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to come up with general hand washing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa you rarely find hand-washing taps near every private or public toilet, although there are cheap options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can be caused by ingrained habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating for handwashing with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to long-term changes in people’s behaviour.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective at increasing hand washing in lower-middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting hand washing in schools is the “three-star approach” designed by UNICEF to encourage schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one star to three stars at the end of the day.
Construction of hand-washing stations can be part of hand-washing promotion campaigns conducted to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaigns trying to bring about behaviour change. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Few studies have looked at the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries and its relationship to disability-adjusted life years.
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation procedures.
The importance of hand washing for human health – especially for people in critical conditions such as newly born mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two hand cleaners: Hungarian physician Agnes Simmelves, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Englishman Florence Nightingale, “the founder of modern nursing.”
Most people at the time still believed that the infection was due to bad odors called miasmaz.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and healthcare-related infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more effectively as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect oneself from these infectious diseases.
For example, posters containing the “right ways to wash hands” were hung next to hand-washing sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The term “hands-washing” means something that is a declaration of one’s unwillingness to take responsibility for the thing or participate in complicity in it.
It stems from a passage in the Bible in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a phrase with much wider use in some English societies.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth begins to wash her hands excessively in an attempt to cleanse a fantasy-making spot of her guilt over the crimes she has committed and the crimes she has urged her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after referring to or thinking about unethical actions, tend to wash their hands more than others, and tend to appreciate hand-washing tools more.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after this study are less likely to participate in other “cleansing” compensatory measures, such as volunteering.
Religions describe hand washing for both health and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water without handwashing soap, is part of the hand washing ritual that has emerged in many religions, including the Baha'i, Hindu, and Tefilah faith, hand washing in Judaism, washing in Christianity, and ablution in Islam. Religions also impose healthy hand washing, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam require washing hands after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.
Controls over the risks of COVID-19 in the workplace
COVID-19 Risk Controls at the workplace are the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for risk control to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The right workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and job function, based on a risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of disease in the community, and risk factors for working individuals who may be at risk of COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk work involves minimal contact with the public and other co-workers, a condition in which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, observing the etiquette of coughing and sneezing, and maintaining normal practices of cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Medium-exposure-risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact with individuals who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but may become infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who have reached out to the general public as in schools, high labor-intensive work environments, and some large retail outlets.
Risk controls for this group, as well as basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, sneezing barriers, and the use of personal protective equipment available in the case of a person with COVID-19.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration considers health care workers and a mortuary that are exposed to a person known to have COVID-19 or a suspect to have high levels of exposure risk, which increases the risk of exposure if workers are performing aerosol generation procedures, or collecting or handling samples from a person known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment appropriate for the job.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have multiple effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to illness, the need to care for others, or fear of potential exposure.
Trade patterns may change, in terms of both the quality of the goods ordered and the ways they are obtained (such as shopping off-peak hours or via delivery services or shopping without leaving the car).
Finally, shipments of goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may stop. The infection-causing disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide preventive action.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and job functions, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and risk factors for individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also sets out the controls needed to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national and subnational recommendations.
Outbreak response goals include reducing employee transmission, protecting people most at risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing negative impacts on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the society in which the business is located affects the responses taken.
The hierarchy of risk control controls is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to classify risk control controls by effectiveness.
Because the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without relying on worker behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative controls are changes in work policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected based on the risk to the worker, appropriateness as appropriate (e.g. respirators), continuous and correct wear, regular inspection, maintenance and replacement, as necessary, and removal, cleaning, storage, or proper disposal to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs that involve less risk exposure involve minimal contact with the public and other co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and complete hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, taking into account the etiquette of coughing and sneezing including covering the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, providing napkins and garbage containers, preparing for remote work or organizing work shifts in succession if necessary, and discouraging workers from using hand sanitizers and other equipment.
The immediate identification and isolation of potentially contagious individuals is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until fever, fever signs, and any other symptoms go away for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-lowering or other medications that improve symptoms, that sick leave policies be flexible, and that employees stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, jobs with a medium risk of exposure include those requiring frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of individuals who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may develop SARS-CoV-2 due to the ongoing transmission of infection in the community around the workplace, or due to a recent international travel to a site where COVID-19 transmission is widespread.
This includes workers who are in contact with the public, such as in schools, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, workplaces, etc.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person becomes ill while on board an aircraft, appropriate prevention controls to protect workers and other passengers include keeping the sick passenger away from others by 6 feet, assigning one member of the aircraft team to serve the sick person, providing the sick person with a face mask or requiring the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with tissue paper when coughing or sneezing.
The crew must wear disposable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or touching body fluids or contaminated surfaces, and may use additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include postponing travel when sick, self-isolation and immediately informing the on-board medical center if a person has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the isolated person’s cabin. For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure of cleaning or disinfection if the infected person is present in the school building regardless of community prevalence.
When there is a limited to moderate community transmission limit, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as canceling field trips, gatherings, and other large gatherings such as physical education classes, band lessons, or eating meals in the canteen, increasing distances between offices, organizing consecutive attendance and departure times, reducing unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health desk for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a significant transmission of infection in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, the extension of school dropout dates can be considered. For law enforcement officers who carry out routine daily activities, the immediate health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must communicate with individuals who have been confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as medical emergency technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of direct contact during arrest, workers should clean and disinfect work belts and tools before reusing them using a spray or household cleaning mop, follow standard work procedures to deal with pollution, dispose of used personal protective equipment, and collect and wash clothes.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSH) believes that some health care workers and cadavers fall into categories with high or very high levels of risk.
Jobs with a high level of risk include health care, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients known or suspected to have COVID-19.
These become extremely high-risk if workers perform aerosol generating procedures, as well as collecting or handling samples from patients confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchospasms, certain dental procedures and tests, or the collection of invasive samples.
The functions of a high-risk morgue include personnel involved in the preparation of the bodies of persons confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of their death; those with a very high level of risk if they perform an autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these at-risk groups include isolation rooms for patients known or suspected to have COVID-19, including when performing procedures for generating aerosols.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and the preservation of dead bodies.
Samples should be handled following level 3 biosafety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends isolating patients arriving in separate waiting areas based on whether or not they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends the use of respirators for those working within 6 feet of known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients, and for those who perform procedures to generate aerosols.
In the United States, N95 face-mask respirators, approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or better devices, must be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program, which includes installation and suitability testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. The World Health Organization does not recommend the use of aprons, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted by body fluids.
The WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for screening staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect, care for, or transport respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-generating procedures, the World Health Organization recommends using a surgical mask, goggles, face protection, and jumpsuits.
If an aerosol procedure is performed, the face mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator mask.
Given that the global supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends reducing the need for personal protective equipment through telemedicine, and physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using personal protective equipment only necessary for the specific task, and continuing to use the same breathing mask without removing it while caring for many patients with a diagnosis.

We found ourselves in the midst of exceptional circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has become a clear demonstration of global human connectedness and the responsibilities we have towards others.
Our history has never seen similar challenges, but we know for sure that the best response depends on a kind of global empathy, collaboration, and community-building, elements that are at the heart of this institution.
The close friendship and care we have seen among all our colleagues through emails, calls and conversations is an amazing demonstration of the amazing human emotions that surround, fortunately, the way we do business.
I am very grateful and deeply proud to have you as true colleagues.
Last week, someone sent me a letter to express their appreciation for our work.
They reminded me of how critical the world’s ability to move towards Wikipedia is right now, and the powerful symbolism of this critical resource remaining available online and accessible to everyone.
Your efforts have made it possible, whether it’s by keeping the sites running, getting our colleagues paid, or providing safety for our communities.
The world is in desperate need of the information available on Wikipedia more than ever before.
It is a moment in which the positive impact in the world is not only on the efforts we make, but also on the way we make them.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make significant adjustments to how we work together starting next week.
Modifications to the working method and schedules
As Rubin mentioned earlier, Team C met yesterday to discuss our method and schedule for the days and months ahead.
In that discussion, we looked at what we saw as an appropriate response to what we are facing, and the ideal way to sustain an organization’s business during this period.
We desperately wanted to get rid of stress and stress, and support our mission in the long run.
If you want to reduce your workload and tasks, that’s fine.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
The expected daily working time is 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
If you are able to work longer than normal working hours, you may add your efforts to the task.
However, the world is now unpredictable, and whether you want to take care of your loved ones, get groceries or go to the doctor, your safety is our top priority.
We don't track your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should be understood to allow this without expressing it, but we mention it with certainty.
No sick leave or paid leave is required, just inform your manager and help your team review calendars and schedules to make sure key areas of work are covered.
(If your doctor has a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, please tell Brian at the Department of Training and Certification Operations so that the Department of Training and Certification can help by providing support and making sure your case gets the appropriate care from the Department.)
Hourly colleagues receive their full wages.
We have already mentioned this, and this pledge renews our commitments to our contractors and our hourly colleagues.
Each employee will be paid based on normal working hours during normal circumstances.
This includes whether the employee is sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
A lot of people are taking advantage of the work to overcome the pressures that are spreading in the world around us.
What we can do will be incredibly productive, especially during difficult times like this.
Again, it’s about taking care of oneself.
We only ask that you contact your manager so that he knows what to expect and adjust the procedures to adapt accordingly.
Some work is necessary.
There are also some things that we need to keep going.
Site reliability engineering teams, HR operations, trust, trust, fundraising (and more) are doing critical work, which may need more support.
We will begin a process in collaboration with all departments to evaluate current goals and shift our focus to supporting the elements necessary to achieve our mission.
There is a lot of work to be done by all of us, and we will focus on only the most important projects.
Going slower now, it won't hurt us later.
We don't plan to "double the working time to catch up" after the pandemic is over.
We are not expected to work overtime to meet the currently unrealistic deadlines.
We accept the fact that those circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new targets and timetables when appropriate.
What Happens in Annual Planning (APP)?
To adapt to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the delivery schedule for our 2020-2021 annual planning.
We intend to propose extending our 2019-2020 plan to allow more time for budget design to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and caring for loved ones while accommodating those who need or want to work on a reduced work schedule over the next few weeks.
This extension of the schedule eases the current planning workload and pressure across the entire organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Board of Directors next week and will update delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as confirmation is received.
We thank the annual planning team for its leading role in this matter.
Office status, exposure and cleaning
We learned last week that one of our colleagues working in San Francisco may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, out of extreme caution and prohibition, we hired a virus-resistant cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
The team used a hospital-grade antivirus solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the hallway and elevator units that lead to our floor.
The building has implemented its own Care Duty Protocol using products that support tenant safety.
We feel comfortable because the office is conveniently ready until the time we decide to return to work.
Our Washington, D.C. office is located in a WeWork building, which we shared its COVID-19 protocol with all members of the staff at our Washington, D.C. headquarters.
Starting last week, our Washington, D.C. office moved away entirely under the guidance of our San Francisco office.
As some of our colleagues in our New York City headquarters know, we had a discussion about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed for some time.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that this may be an amendment, and they would like to offer you some advice:
Meeting time should be limited to a maximum of one hour or a gradual increase of up to two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to divide them over several days.
The meeting should be clearly defined, an agenda drawn up, and reading materials sent in advance.
Video should be made the default solution, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct communication.
Each meeting should be facilitated, and one person should monitor the conversation to find out the questions and track the list of speakers, and another person to help take notes (or carry out a collaborative note-taking process).
An email should be sent to technical support when you need comfortable headphones.
A health and safety compensation program can be used to obtain the cost of snacks.
You can join the <0x23>remotieschannel in the Slack app to talk to colleagues about distributed work
The HR Operations team is looking for user-friendly, online meeting-based guidance to support the increase in business distributed across our organization.
Over the past week, we have asked all community grantees to cancel all public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the Editathon web site editors’ events, until the World Health Organization (WHO) announces the end of the pandemic.
We told them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete agreed grant activities, and that no one will be fined for having to delay or modify these goals.
Next week we will issue additional follow-up guidance on Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The public sentiment that pervades the global community is mixed with sadness over the turmoil, relief at the clarity and ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia and others.
As these actions progress, the Crisis Response Team is designing a page in MetaWiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and keep track of all communications with it.
Stay up-to-date on COVID-19-related topics
We will send an invitation to your calendars next Thursday at 14:00 UTC, 07:00 Pacific time for the working group meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer questions and spend time communicating with each other.
We are going through this experience together and are always ready to help as much as possible.
In the meantime, we may continue to obtain information from this email, and all other necessary COVID-19-related information available at Office Wiki.
The Crisis Response Team will keep these pages up-to-date and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contacts with workers living in severely affected States.
If you have any questions about travel, events, key business areas, coverage challenges or anything else you need assistance with, please do not hesitate to inform us and cooperate with our Crisis Response Team.
We are always ready to provide support and communication as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive issue, please send an email to Brian Gooden, Director of Global International Human Resources Operations.
Any such change shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the work entrusted to us or the obligations incumbent upon us.
Instead, it is a realization in the present moment, that our work and our obligations are likely to need to be adapted in a way that we have not experienced in the past.
We believe these steps are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue to work and provide our people with the support they need, and provide the world with the service they depend on.
The work we have planned will be waiting for us when the time comes.
Now, it’s time for each person to lend a hand to the other and create space for the important work that comes in the coming weeks and months.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we need all of you to take care of yourself and your families to be at your best when your efforts are needed.
Please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Catherine is the Director of the Crisis Response Team (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jimmy V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the other members of the leadership team (Grant A, Heather W, Jimmy V, Janine U, Lisa S, Robin E).
The enzyme converted to angiotensin 2 (ACE2) binds to the outer surface (cellular membranes) of cells in the lung, arteries, heart, and kidney, as well as the intestine.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 counteracts the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin 2 and increasing angiotensin (1-7); making it a promising drug in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is also an entry point for some types of coronavirus into cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 is a metal enzyme that contains zinc and is located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The angiotensin-2-converting enzyme protein on the M2 peptidease range has an amino tip, and the carboxylic colic chain is a transporter of renal amino acids.
Angiotensin 2 is a single-pass membrane protein of type 1, and has active enzymatic receptors present on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular portion of the angiotensin 2 enzyme is separated from the transmembrane domain by an enzyme called chidaz, resulting in the release of soluble protein into the bloodstream and then excreted through the urine.
Angiotensin 2 is present in most organs of the body: it is linked to the cell membrane of type 2 alveolar cells in the lung, to the intestinal cells of the small intestine, to the endothelial cells of the arteries and veins, as well as to the smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall in most organs.
The transmissible RNA of the angiotensin-2-transforming enzyme is found in the cerebral cortex, the schema, the hypothalamus, and the brain stem.
The primary function of the angiotensin-2-converting enzyme is to act as a counterbalance to the angiotensin-converting enzyme.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme stimulates the conversion of angiotensin 1 hormone to angiotensin 2 blood vessel clutch.
In contrast, the angiotensin-2-converting enzyme separates the amino acid phenylalanine-containing carboxylate from the angiotensin-2 (aspartite-arginine-valin-tyrosine-isoleucine-histidine-proline-phenylalanine) and converts it into angiotensin-2 (aspartate-arginine-phenylalanine).
Angiotensin-2-converting enzyme breaks down into a number of other peptides including [des-arginine9] - bradykinin, abelin, neurotincin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
Angiotensin 2-transforming enzyme also regulates the membrane passage of a neutral transporter of SLC6A19 and has a role in Hartnup disease.
Angiotensin-2, as a transmembrane protein, is the main entry into cells for some coronaviruses, which include human coronavirus NL63, SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS), and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the association of the S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with the enzymatic range of the angiotensin-2-transforming enzyme on the cell surface leads to cellular rectification and transmission of the virus and enzyme to the internal particles located in the cells.
This insertion process requires the synthesis of S protein by the host’s transmembrane protease enzyme, Serin2, whose inhibitor is still under trial as a potential treatment. This makes some hypothesize that lowering the levels of the ACE2 enzyme in cells may help fight infection.
However, many specialized associations and self-regulatory bodies recommend continuing to use the usual angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as a treatment.
A systematic study and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was accompanied by a 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the reference group.
Furthermore, “the risk of pneumonia was reduced among those treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with a stroke or heart failure.
The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has led to a reduction in mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less robust compared to the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Human recombinant angiotensin 2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a new treatment for acute lung injuries, as it has been found to improve the distribution of pulmonary blood, as well as oxygen saturation in pigs with acute dyspnea induced by polysaccharides.
The half-life of the recombinant angiotensin-2 enzyme is approximately 10 hours, while it begins to work after 30 minutes, and continues to be effective (time period) for up to 24 hours.
There is ample evidence to suggest that recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 may be a promising treatment for those with traditional angiotensin-resonant intolerance (RAS) and in diseases accompanied by a rise in angiotensin-2 in the blood. Clinical trials are under assessment, on the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme infusion.
COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to help track people who are in contact in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, meaning the process of identifying people (“contacts”) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Numerous applications have been designed or proposed with official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed to design applications to track contacts.
Many have expressed concerns about privacy, particularly about systems that rely on tracking the geographic location of app users.
Less invasive alternatives to privacy include using Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced together that they might integrate a functionality that supports these Bluetooth-based applications, directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government in collaboration with Alipay has published an app that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19 or not.
It is an app used by individuals in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, individuals use an app called TraceTogether.
A local IT association has designed the app, released it as an open-source app and is due to be delivered to the government. North Macedonia has launched StopKorona, an app based on the use of Bluetooth to track exposure to potentially infected individuals and provide rapid response to healthcare authorities.
The Ministry of Communications and Technology in cooperation with the Ministry of Health has taken over the design of the application.
On April 14, 2020, the app was still awaiting adoption of Apple's Google Play Store and App Store.
On 12 April, the government reported that the contact tracing app was in the advanced development stage, and may become available for distribution within weeks.Ireland and France plan to launch a similar app, ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering designing apps based on the TraceTogether app launched by Singapore, as well as the BlueTrace protocol.Russia intends to roll out an app that uses the geographic virtual environment of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by doctors residing in Moscow, and is designed to make sure they don’t leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has mentioned a number of potential practical problems surrounding application-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiencies if application use is limited to only a small segment of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful coronavirus apps, Apple has imposed restrictions on the types of organizations that can add their coronavirus-related apps to their app store, limiting this to only “official” or other reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the consequences of mass surveillance resulting from the use of coronavirus applications, particularly as to whether or not the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will disappear once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
The organizations also announced eight conditions for government projects:
Control should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
Monitoring and control extensions should include provisions relating to when they will be stopped;
The use of data should be limited to the purposes for COVID-19;
Data security and the confidentiality of data owners should be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid increasing discrimination and marginalization;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be specified in the law;
Protections against abuse and protection of the rights of citizens should be in place to address abuses;
"Effective participation" from all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups, is required. German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter ohne Greenzen (RSF) have also issued checklists.
Google/Apple’s proposed plan aims to address the ongoing monitoring problem by removing the tracking mechanism from device operating systems once the need for it is over.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download the app and the possibility of avoiding tracking.
In Israel, officials have adopted network-based tracking.
But network-based solutions that have access to site raw data have potentially significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a number of privacy preservation systems have been created that use only central servers for intercom (see the section below).
In South Korea, officials used a non-application-based system to carry out contact tracing.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking and card transaction data, and includes this data to send notifications via text messages to individuals with potential infections.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available as well, which it has allowed due to wide-ranging changes to information privacy laws following the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus in that country.
This information is available to the public via a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, have considered using both centralized and privacy-preserving systems.
On April 6, 2020, details on this matter have yet to be released.
Tracking privacy-friendly contacts is a well-executed and successful concept supported by powerful research literature dating back to at least 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts worked to access privacy-compatible solutions, such as low-power Bluetooth (PLE) to record user proximity to other cell phones.
However, BEP-BPT was a coordination effort with both central and decentralized approaches, not an individual protocol. Decentralized protocols include privacy-protected decentralized approach tracking (DP-BPT/DPT-3T), and temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly known as event numbers).
In these protocols, the personal identification data does not leave the device, and all matches occur on the device.
The privacy group at MIT Media Lab has been working on developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-preserving technologies when collecting location data or crossing paths to track the spread of COVID-19.
Based on research from the March 2020 report “The Evil Face of Apps: Preserving Personal Privacy in the Epidemic,” Enigma MPC’s SafeTrace platform, a privacy technology developer that also originated at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and administrators without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the Global Contact Number Tracking Coalition was founded by groups whose focus was on what was essentially a similar approach and heavily overlapping protocols, and whose goal was to reduce fragmentation and enable global interchangeability between tracking and alert applications, a key feature to achieve widespread use.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the Blue Tris protocol, which is used by the official government application, open-source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the two companies that control the Android and iOS mobile operating systems, announced an initiative to track the two contacts, claiming that they would maintain privacy based on a combination of low-power Bluetooth technology and privacy-friendly encryption.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the goal is to roll out the system in three stages:
Introducing tools to enable governments to create formal, privacy-preserving applications to track coronavirus
Integrate this functionality directly into Android and iOS, and Google and Apple plan to resolve ongoing usage and monitoring issues by distributing the systems first through OS updates and then by removing them in the same way as soon as the threat is over.
Repurposing a drug (also known as re-use, re-allocation, target change or therapeutic transformation of the drug) is re-identifying the use of an approved drug to treat a different disease or medical condition than was originally designed to treat.
This is a method of scientific research that researchers are currently using to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research trends include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and the transfer of purified plasma.The SARS-CoV-2 virus contains approximately 66 drug-treatable proteins, each of which has multiple binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable plan on the development of an effective antiviral drug that eliminates COVID-19 proteins.
Among the proteins targeted for SARS-CoV-2 are the two-door protease, ribosome DNA polymerase based on ribosome DNA, helicase, protein S, and the ribophosphate adenosine diphosphate phosphatase.
Hussein A. A., et al. studied several candidate compounds that were then improved and analyzed for similarity of their structure to approved drugs of higher similarity in order to accelerate the development of a potent SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug in his preclinical study to recommend it in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is a malaria treatment drug that doctors also use to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and its associated hydroxychloroquine could be among four drugs under study as part of a clinical solidarity trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that New York State trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may begin on March 24.On March 28, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use License (E.U.A.).
Treatment by the FDA’s clinical trial process has not been approved and is licensed under the Emergency Use License only as an experimental treatment for emergency use to treat patients who have been hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in the clinical trial.
The CDC announced that it had not yet determined "the use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, doses or period."
Doctors said they use the drug when “there is no other option.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is currently conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in addition to zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are being conducted at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
The Langone School of Medicine at New York University is conducting an experiment on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed that favipiravir was “clearly effective.”
Of the 35 patients in Shenzhen, the test results were negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a Wuhan study of 240 patients with pneumonia, half of them were given fafibravir and the other half received omefenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has alerted people that the existing evidence supporting the drug is incomplete and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to incorporate it into its reserve stock, and would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Journal, Shinzo Abe has held preliminary talks with the Trump administration about buying the drug.The drug may be less effective in treating the more severe cases where the virus has already doubled.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who want to get pregnant.
One study using lubenavir/ritonavir (Calitra), the combination of lubenavir and ritonavir antivirals, reported that the results “did not detect any benefit.”
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV to prevent it from being replicated by binding it to proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to access a compound linked to SARS-CoV-2.The scientific community is experiencing a case of criticism about channeling resources into redefining the purposes of drugs specifically designed to treat HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has added Lupinavir/Ritonavir to the international solidarity experience.
Gilead Sciences developed the drug Remedisvir as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences then discovered that Remedisvir is characterized by antiviral activity in the laboratory against several nematode viruses, mucosal viruses and coronaviruses.
One of the problems with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through transformations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preclinical studies suggest that remadivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance.There are several existing clinical trials, including two conducted by University of Cleveland hospitals; one for those with moderate disease, and one for patients with the most severe disease.
There are three clinical trials of antiviral vitamin C in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease, as well as two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled trial (Italy).
New York State began trials on the antibiotic effect of azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Center for Public Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to carry out a clinical trial on the use of Teijin’s velvesco (cyclisonide), an inhaled corticosteroid to treat asthma, to treat patients with the novel coronavirus before symptoms appear.
A phase II trial using a form of an angiotensin-2-transforming enzyme is currently underway in 200 patients who are required to join the trial of acute cases admitted to hospital in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called Colcorona, involved 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms without needing to be hospitalized.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Many anticoagulants are also being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is currently widely used to treat patients, which requires the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidance on its use.
A multicenter study in Italy of 300 patients has been announced to examine the use of sodium inoxaparin in doses for disease prevention and therapeutic doses on April 14.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, great scientific attention has been focused on the re-use of approved antiviral drugs that have been designed to deal with previous outbreaks such as the March virus, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Specialists recommend the use of Ribavirin for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th version of the Chinese directive
Omifenovir: Specialists recommend the use of Omifenovir for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th version of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics that specialists have identified as potentially reusable as COVID-19 treatments include:
Tosilizumab (anti-interleukin receptor 6): Certified by China.
Experiences in Italy and China as well. See Tucelizumab <0x23>COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a presumptive vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccines have been completed for clinical trials, several attempts are under way to develop this vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing it, to be available in less than 18 months.
There were five candidate vaccines in the first phase of safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to significant investments and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The requirements of the Alliance for Epidemiological Preparedness Innovations for Vaccine Development initiative, announced in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global reach.
In April, scientists from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform objectives that have progressed to the first phase of safety studies include:
DNA (deoxyribose and ribose DNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (phase I developer and vaccine filter: Moderna, adenovirus type 5 carrier)
According to the Coalition for Epidemiological Preparedness Innovations scientists reported in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 more projects announced, but with little public information available (presumably at the planning stage or being designed).
The Phase I and Phase II trials conduct a preliminary safety and compliance test, usually random, controlled by placebo, and in multiple locations, with more accurate and effective dosing.
Phase III trials typically involve a larger number of participants, including the reference group, and a vaccine efficacy test to prevent the disease, while monitoring the adverse effects of the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines under active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 were not yet under human evaluation (still under research "preclinical").
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the possibility of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins in order to stimulate an immune response.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the Center for International Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine, targeting the start of testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, led by Haneke Schwitmaker, announced that they had begun work on developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with her biotech partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emerging BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a study on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that used in cancer treatment with the novel antigen vaccine.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had finished manufacturing the vaccine and had begun testing.
On 27 February 2020, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, a subsidiary of Generex, announced that it had started a vaccine project to synthesize the Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine that could be tested in humans “within 90 days.”
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research Command and the Walter Reed Military Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in West Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had formed a team with Novavax Inc.
In the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for pre-clinical tests and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolated cases, and that even as the pace of work accelerates it will take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company in Quebec City, reported that it was developing a virus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The candidate vaccine is undergoing laboratory research, with plans for testing in humans in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “significant amounts of money” for exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government protested.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop a vaccine based on transmissible RNA.
The BNT162 candidate RNA-based vaccine is currently undergoing pre-clinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that it would get the results of pre-clinical tests in April 2020 and the final candidate vaccine could begin to have tests in humans by autumn.
In France on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemiological Preparedness Innovations (CEPA) announced a $4.9 million investment in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium that includes the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of the Coalition for Epidemiological Preparedness Innovations in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine to $29 million.
Partners of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations for COVID-19 vaccine development are Moderna, Curevac, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing in animals for six different candidate vaccines.
Imperial College London researchers announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-inflicted ribose DNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on COVID-19 medical countermeasures, including several candidate vaccines at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a national “vaccine bank” of several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported tests for PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "Sars-CoV-2 subunit S1 vaccines given with microscopic needles elicited strong responses to specific antigenic antibodies [in mice] that were evident starting 2 weeks after vaccination."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a candidate vaccine based on DNA-deoxyribose as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate within human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to the virus, which may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access IBM supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the disease they are fighting.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers.
Vaccines being developed are unlikely to be safe or effective.
Early research to assess the efficacy of the vaccine using specific animal models of COVID-19, such as mice genetically modified by the angiotensin-2-transforming enzyme, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, suggests the need for level 3 biosafety containment measures to deal with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Anti-Sars and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome vaccines have been tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or preventive vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for SARS treatment has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no approved vaccine against MERS.
When March spread, it was thought that existing research on SARS might provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and treatments against Mars-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one Middle East respiratory syndrome vaccine (based on hypoxic RNA) that completed the first phase of clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines under development, all of which were virus-targeted vaccines, two MRS-targeted vaccines (ChAdOx1-MRS), and one MRS-targeted vaccine (ChAdOx1-MRS).
Social media posts sparked a conspiracy theory claiming that the COVID-19-causing virus was known and that the vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by many social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequencing and vaccines for other strains of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
The period between exposure to the injury and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases show mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million people were reported infected in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread among people during mixing, often by spraying scattered when coughing, sneezing, or talking.
When the spray is scattered during the exhalation process, it usually falls to the ground or surfaces rather than being contagious over long distances.
People may also get infected when they touch a contaminated surface and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after symptoms appear, although it may spread before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is the reaction of RRT-PCR polymerase sequences through a nasopharyngeal pharyngeal smear.
Masks are recommended for those suspected of contracting the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending that they should not be used, others suggesting otherwise, and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People with the virus may not have symptoms or flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Immediate medical attention is recommended if there are emergency symptoms of difficulty breathing, constant pain or pressure in the chest area, disturbance, difficulty waking, or blueness of the face or lips.
In less common cases, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying proportions.
Initially, some cases in China suffered only from chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease may develop into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who show symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.Reports suggest that symptoms may not appear in all those infected.
The role of carriers of the disease without symptoms in transmission has not yet been fully identified; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may have contributed to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people with no symptoms is currently unknown in the study, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20 percent of the total confirmed cases did not show symptoms during their hospital stay.
China’s National Health Commission began listing asymptomatic cases on the daily toll on April 1; of the 166 cases on that day, 130 (78%) had no symptoms at the time of the test.
Sputum and saliva may carry large proportions of the virus.
Speaking out loud results in more spray than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore showed that coughing without covering the mouth may lead to a spray that is scattered to a distance of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually transmitted by air, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that it can be transmitted by bio-aerosols, and testing samples of air collectors in the lobby outside of individuals' rooms have yielded positive results for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be released as a spray, and then the virus spreads through the air.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through the stool, it is thought to be a limited risk.The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; while it may spread before symptoms appear, the risk is lower.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that despite some ambiguity about how easily the disease spreads, one person can go from two to three others in general. The virus remains stuck on surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to remain present for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies based on humidity and temperature.
Soap and antiseptics are also effective provided they are used properly; soap dissolves the protective fatty membrane of the virus and stops its work, in addition to ridding the skin and other surfaces of it.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical antiseptic), are less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken after an average of two days of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and on the second day of testing the sixth patient showed the highest viral load.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome, first isolated from three people with pneumonia in the group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus shares its properties with the relevant coronaviruses found in nature.
Outside the body, home soap eliminates the virus, destroying its protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the two organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cells by the angiotensin-2 (ACE2)-transforming enzyme, which is the most abundant in type 2 alveolar cells found in the lung.
The virus uses a special surface-diabetic protein called "spike" (volvae section) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Twelve percent of the infected people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China, had severe heart attacks and were more common in critical cases.
The rates of cardiovascular-related symptoms are high, due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the development of the disease, but acute heart muscle injury may also be associated with the heart's ACA2 receptor.
ACE2 receptors have a very important role in the heart and are involved in performing its functions.
The rate of thrombosis (31%) and venous thrombosis (25%) in patients in the intensive care unit with COVID-19 increased, which may be associated with poor prediction of the outcome of the disease. The autopsy of the bodies of individuals who died of COVID-19 found widespread diphtheria damage (DAD), and inflammatory lesion containing lymphocytes inside the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is directed towards epithelial cells expressing ACE2 in the respiratory tract, severe COVID-19 patients suffer from symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, T cells that secrete disease-causing GM-CSF have been shown to be associated with bringing in the only cells that secrete inflammatory interleukin 6 and inflammatory lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
It was also reported that there was a lymphocytic lesion at the autopsy.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published several test protocols for the disease.
The polymerase chain reaction of instantaneous reverse copying (RRT-PCR) is the standard method of testing.
The test is usually performed using respiratory samples taken from a nasal pharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or phlegm sample may also be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but this requires taking two blood samples within two weeks and the results are of minimal direct value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and spread genetic sequencing so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which may detect an active infection and whether a person has been infected in the past) were under development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experiment on the test showed that accuracy is only 60-70%.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first clinical point-of-care test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines from Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital have suggested ways to detect infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
Double-sided, multilobular sanded glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior spread are common features at the beginning of the injury.
Sublateral spread and coagulation form (thickness of the spheroid with uneven synaptic filler) may appear and merge with the development of the disease.
Few data are available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
Main pathological conclusions of autopsies:
Microscopic examination: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary embolism and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pulmonary cell hyperplasia, large, non-typical alveolar cells, and intramuscular inflammation with lymphocytic filtration and formation of multinuclear giant cells
Acute pneumonia: diffuse diastolic damage (DAD) with diffuse diastolic secretions.
Widespread alveolar damage causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute hypoxia.
Treatment of pneumonia: regulation of secretions in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukocyte reactivity
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eye, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, and recommends using the inside of the elbow if a napkin is not available.
It is recommended to clean your hands thoroughly after any cough or sneezing.
CDC has recommended the use of cloth face coverings in public places, in part to reduce the transmission of asymptomatic infections.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the mixing of people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
The spacing guidelines also include that people are at least 6 feet apart (1.8 m) apart.
There is no drug known to be effective in the prevention of COVID-19. Since no vaccine innovation is expected until 2021 at the earliest, the main part of controlling COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is known as “curve flattening.”
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are clearly dirty, before eating, and after cleaning the nose, coughing or sneezing.
It is also recommended to use a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, when soap and water are not available only. For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO offers two formulations for local production.
Antimicrobial activity in these two compounds originates from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is “not an effective substance for cleansing hands.”
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People receive supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of contracting the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under study.
Personal hygiene and reliance on a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive therapies may benefit those with mild symptoms during the early stage of the infection. The World Health Organization and China’s National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of those hospitalized for COVID-19.
Intensive care specialists and pulmonologists in the United States have collected treatment recommendations from a variety of bodies in a free resource, the Critical Care Book available online.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 was available.
For symptoms, some doctors recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen as the first treatment.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that may result in a spray, such as intubation or manual respiration.
For healthcare professionals taking care of people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an air-borne infection (AIIR) isolation room as well as using standard precautions, mixing precautions and air-borne disease precautions.
Recommended tools: personal protective equipment (PPE) aprons, respirator or face mask, eye protectors, and medical gloves. It is preferable to use respirators (rather than face masks) when available.
The N95 respirators were approved for industrial facilities, but the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of masks under the Emergency Use Permit (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a particular biological agent is uncertain in the case of uses for other unspecified purposes.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face masks or home-made masks as a last resort.
Most COVID-19 cases are not so severe that they require artificial respiration or alternatives, but some cases do.
The type of respiratory support provided to people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure in hospital settings is actively studied, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided using a high-flow nasal cannula or positive bi-level airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these options would be of the same benefit to those with a critical condition or not.
Some doctors prefer to continue using invasive respiration when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high-flow nasal cannula.Critical conditions are common among older adults (those over 60, especially those over 80).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per population, which limits the health system’s ability to cope with the sudden rise in the number of serious COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed industrial respiratory support, and 1.4% died.
In China, nearly 30 percent of those hospitalized for COVID-19 eventually enter intensive care units.
Artificial respiration becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in people with COVID-19 and the supply of oxygen becomes more difficult.
Respirators need to have pressure control and high positive expiratory pressure to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of respiratory and pneumothorax-related lung injury.
High positive expiratory pressure may not be available in old respirators.
The search for potential treatments began in January 2020, and many antiviral drugs are in the clinical trial phase.
It seems that Rimdisevier is the most proselytizing.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, many of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are already at an advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried on people with a critical condition.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended volunteers to participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The Food and Drug Administration has granted a temporary license to use convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person’s life is seriously or directly threatened.
He has not undergone the clinical studies necessary to prove that he is safe and effective against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are required to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect ‘contacts’ using surveillance data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health officials.Big data analytics for mobile data, facial recognition technology, mobile tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track down infected and co-infected people in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled the security services to track the mobile phone data of those presumed to be infected with the coronavirus.
Action has been taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who may be in contact with injured citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared phone location data collected with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, for research purposes and to prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to detect violators of the quarantine.
Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile phone companies told him that “40 percent of people still travel everywhere.”
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend that involved more than 42,000 people.
The President of Estonia, Ms. Kirsti Kaljulaid, also presented a global call for innovative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may feel distressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of the same injury.
The BBC’s Rory O’Connor said: “Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic stagnation is a severe storm that harms people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease may take a mild course with minor or asymptomatic symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Minor cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be more likely to develop severe COVID-19 based on data for other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but there is still a lack of data for COVID-19. COVID-19 may affect the lungs in some people causing pneumonia.
In those most rapidly affected, COVID-19 may develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 are sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Six percent of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital were diagnosed with thrombosis, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, while four percent had impaired kidney function.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 showed an increase in levels of liver enzymes (amniotic transporters).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, including five days in hospital.
However, the average period for those transferred to the intensive care unit between hospitalization and death was seven days.
In a study of early cases, the average time from initial symptoms to death was 14 days, and overall cases ranged from six to 41 days.
In a study conducted by China’s National Health Commission (NHC), the men’s mortality rate was 2.8% while the women’s mortality rate was 1.7%.
Post-mortem histological histological examinations of lung samples show widespread alveolar damage with cellular fibromoxide secretions in both lungs.
Variations of viral cytopathies are observed in alveolar cells.
The lung image shows acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Heart damage due to high troponin levels or cardiac arrest was observed in 11.8% of deaths reported by China’s National Health Commission.
According to data released by the United States in March, 89 percent of those hospitalized had previous conditions.The availability of medical resources and the socioeconomic status of the region may also affect deaths.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary as a result of those differences between regions, but also because of methodological difficulties.
An undercounting of minor cases may lead to a higher estimate of mortality than the truth.
However, the fact that previous cases have caused deaths may indicate that the current mortality rate is lower than the reality.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are 2.4 times more likely to die than non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority revealed a 20 to 30 percent reduction in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung tests indicated damage.
This may also cause post-ICU syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether or not previous infections were earning people recovering from the disease effective and long-lasting immunity.
Immunity is seen as a possibility, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but it has been reported that there have been recoveries of COVID-19 and then re-infected with it later.
These conditions are thought to worsen if the infection persists more than when it is repeated.
The virus is believed to be natural and of animal origin, given the spread of the infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection was largely a result of human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that December 1, 2019 is the first date for symptoms.
Official publications from the World Health Organization (WHO) have reported that December 8, 2019 is the first date for symptoms to appear.
Numerous actions are usually taken to determine the number of deaths.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the size of the tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time taken since the outbreak began and the characteristics of the population such as age, gender and public health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) in its 10th review of the International Classification of Diseases assigned emergency code U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 deaths and code U07.2 to clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 deaths without laboratory-confirmed mortality.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death toll from injuries is 6.9% (153,822,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other metrics include the CFR, which is the percentage of people who have been diagnosed and died of disease, and the IFR, which is the percentage of people who have been diagnosed and undetected and who have died of disease.
These statistics do not have a time frame, and they follow a specific population from injury to the fate of the situation.
Although antibodies may not be produced by the bodies of all infected, their presence may provide information about how many are infected.
At the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castelloni di Ada, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 people (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread due to carnival festivals, and spread to young people, causing a relatively lower mortality rate, and perhaps not all COVID-19 deaths were officially classified as a result.
Moreover, the German health system was not exhausted.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, according to an evaluation of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed due to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the resulting mortality rate varies between men and women.
The mortality rate is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The maximum risk for men is in their 50s, with the gap between men and women narrowing at only 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of these sex differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a cause.
Immuno-differences based on gender, non-smoking prevalence among women and men with concurrent conditions such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The highest percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have an increased risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is COVID-19.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that Ko is short for coronavirus, short for virus and short for disease and 19 refers to the year the outbreak was first detected: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid referring to a specific geographical location (such as China), animal species or group of people, in line with international labeling recommendations aimed at preventing stigma.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, the World Health Organization uses the terms “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus” in public statements.
The disease and virus are commonly referred to as the "coronavirus".
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "Coronavirus" and "Coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the use of the two names novel coronavirus-2019 and acute respiratory disease associated with novel coronavirus-2019 as temporary names for the virus and the disease according to the 2015 guidelines that prohibit the use of sites in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to limited capabilities in standard supply chains, digital industrial companies export healthcare materials such as nose swabs and respirator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier could not deliver on time, a local startup reversed its architecture and issued the required 100 valves in one night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and quickly spread online.
Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no approved drugs or vaccines to treat the disease.
Government institutions, academic groups and industry researchers conduct international research on vaccines and medications for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the “Solidarity Trial” to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but different bodies are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Previous studies of SARS-CoV are used because it resembles SARS-CoV-2 in the use of ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are subject to study.
First, the researchers aim to create a complete vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to provoke an immediate immune response in the human body against a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the microunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to some of the virus’s microunits.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the Spike S protein that helps the virus break into the ACE2 enzyme receptors.
The third strategy is DNA vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique to create a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines resulting from any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine was started on four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-based condolence has been cited as a potential challenge to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine innovation, but this is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are ongoing as of April 2020.
Seven trials of treatments have already been approved for malaria, including four studies involving hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Antiviral drugs proposed to be re-used in the treatment of the new disease make up most of Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials on remedicivir across several countries due to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of potential vaccines and COVID-19 drugs has been conducted as of April 2020. Numerous existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including Remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lupinavir/ritonavir, lupinavir/tonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is preliminary evidence of the efficacy of remdesivir, as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with the drug RemedySphere for euthanasia.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, formerly used to treat malaria, underwent study in China in February 2020, and has preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer review research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virus Research Institute notes that although a dose of 1 gram is recommended, a double dose is extremely dangerous and may cause death.
On March 28, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a license for the emergency use of chloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of treating physicians for those with COVID-19.The 7th version of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin, or omifenofer for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Further study of the effect of nitazoxanide on organisms was recommended after it was shown to inhibit the low concentration of SARS-CoV-2.Studies have shown that the initial configuration of spike protein by transmembrane cyrinase 2 (TMPRS2) is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 entry through interaction with the ACA2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have significant deficiencies that have prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without further study.Osseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
A cytokine storm may be a complication in the later stages of acute COVID-19.
There is evidence that chloroquine hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties.China’s National Health Commission added to the treatment guidelines after completing a small study.
He undergoes a non-random Phase 2 test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe conditions.
In addition to being used in the serum ferritin test to determine cytokine storms, it aims to counter such developments, which are believed to be the cause of death in some patients.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved anti-interleukin-6 receptor T-cell therapy for alkymeric antigen, based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of cytokine secretion syndrome of non-steroidal anti-estrogens that had a different cause in 2017.
To date, there is no established evidence that Tosilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine secretion syndrome.
The method of transport of the purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the COVID-19 immune systems to those who need them is subject to study as a non-vaccine method of passive vaccination.
This strategy was tested on SARS and its results were inconclusive.
Virus neutralization is the expected mechanism of action through which passive antibody therapy can act as a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-based cellular toxicity, phagocytosis, or both, may be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The production of clear-serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies to this virus, can be increased to spread it faster.
Diseases of coronaviruses, a group of closely related syndromes
Lee Wen Liang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, was subsequently injured and died of COVID-19 after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
