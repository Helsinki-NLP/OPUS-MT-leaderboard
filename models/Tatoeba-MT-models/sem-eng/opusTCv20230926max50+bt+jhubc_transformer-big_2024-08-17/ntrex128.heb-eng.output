Members of Parliament in Wales Fear ‘Looking Like Muppets’
Some MPs were disillusioned with the proposal, which would change their title from AMs to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This fear was sparked by plans to change the name of the erasure house to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of parliament across the political spectrum are concerned that this will invite ridicule.
One Labour MP said his people feared it "would rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means poo.
A member of parliament from the Phalyid Kamari party said all his members were “unsatisfied” and offered alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his members were “open to suggestions” about the name change, but noted that the name MWP sounded very similar to Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is expressed in a manner similar to the expression of the letter u in English in the Yorkshire accent.
The House Committee, which is currently drafting the legislation for name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptive words regarding the names of the members of the House of Representatives is, of course, the decision of the members of the House of Representatives themselves."
The Wales Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh legislature the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, in which there was broad support for changing the name of the legislature to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the role of MPs (AMs), the committee recommended Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP option received most support in consultation with the public.
Members of parliament are offering alternative options, but the struggle to achieve a consensus could cause quite a bit of headache for committee chairman Alain Jones, who is due to submit a draft legislation on the changes in the coming weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes to the way the legislature works, including rules to remove members of parliament and the structure of the committee system.
It is the vote of the members of parliament that will ultimately determine the title of their role during the legislative discussions.
Macedonian citizens go to the polls in a referendum on changing the country's name
Citizens will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Greece has long claimed that its northern neighbour's name is a claim to Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore its results.
However, those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in the Harlem neighborhood
According to Mr. Adams, “old neighborhood residents say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner.”
“There are no bars or churches today.”
He said he could understand the disappearance of bars.
“People’s lives today are different,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the neighborhood living room where people visit on a regular basis.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not survive for as long as the heads of the churches expect, “and sooner or later, they will find themselves again at the starting point.”
He said the churches would take the place of apartment buildings with shared homes that house people who are not the type to help neighborhoods maintain their unique character.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and therefore this will hasten the closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will join these churches.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black-majority neighborhood—the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The white Methodist community left in the 1930s.
A black community of believers operating in the area became the owner of the building.
St. Martin’s Church was handed over to a black community of believers under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants at 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused heavy damage to the building, but as part of the plans of the faithful under Reverend Johnson to rebuild it, they commissioned the construction of the bell-carrier.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Sr. Johnson and successor to St. Martin's Church, proudly called it "The Bells of the Poor."
The expert who played the interview in July called it “a cultural treasure” and “a irreplaceable historical tool.”
The expert, Tiffany Ing of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell rayon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who later played the larger rayon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said the Church of St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin’s Church over the past few months has been a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by local church leaders, and others by the Episcopalian diocese.
The Assembly, which is the governing body of the community of believers made up of local believers, wrote a letter to the diocese in July in which it spread its concerns that the diocese would “try to roll up the costs” to the assembly, even though the assembly was not involved in recruiting the diocese’s architects and contractors.
Some believers complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishops.
Shark Wounds 13-Year-Old Boy in Diving to Capture Lobsters
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as the boy dived to catch lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy cry out for help and then ran there with a group to help draw him to the beach.
Hummel thought at first that it was just enthusiasm for Lobster's capture, but then realized that the boy was screaming, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
Hamel said that when he approached the boy he saw that “his whole collarbone was torn off.”
“I shouted out to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was flown to Rady Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is defined as human.
It is not known what species of shark attacked the boy.
Rescue chief Larry Giles said in a press briefing that a shark had been identified in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body.
Authorities closed access to the coast between the coast of Ponto in Cabaldad and the coast of Swami in Assinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s begins competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and opens doggy shop-style aisles with professional saleswomen.
As part of a significant initiative to penetrate the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion-a-year beauty market in the UK, which continues to grow as sales in fashion and home products decline, the expanded beauty product pipeline will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be added to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty products comes as supermarkets look for ways to use the space from shelves previously seized by televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury’s said the company is expected to double its supply of beauty products to up to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time in its history.
Existing L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees product lines will also be added to designated brand areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket chain is also re-launching its line of makeup products - Boutique - so that most of the products will be vegan-friendly, a feature that is increasingly in demand among young buyers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will look into franchises at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croyden, South London, last week and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and going beyond buying smaller amounts of food every day at local convenience stores require supermarkets to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the stores will become more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to battle the cheaper Aldi and Lidl chains with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury’s has added Argos points of sale in hundreds of stores as well as a number of Habitat points since it acquired the two chains two years ago, additions that it says have boosted grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts by the network to revive its beauty department and pharmacy ended in failure.
Sainsbury's attempted a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the engagement ended after a dispute over how to divide the profits from pharmacies within the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmacy business at 281 stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the program, she said, by expanding the supply of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty products transitions to improve the environment for customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained employees who will be able to provide advice on the spot.
Our brand offerings are designed to suit every need and our attractive environment and comfortable locations make us an attractive destination for purchasing beauty products, challenging the old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones infuriated after Holly Willoughby canceled <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has expressed “angry” after Hollywood presenter Willaby canceled an <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Actually, Willoughby doesn't have time for their clothing and accessories brand.
The joint business of the two is considered similar to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced her departure in a post on Instagram.
Holly Willaby has left Dragons Den star Peter Jones infuriated by the last-minute cancellation of her participation in the couple’s prestigious lifestyle brand – to focus on her fat contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones responded with "angry" when the TV star announced during a stormy meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that due to her new deals - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 - she did not have enough time to devote to the brand of their clothes and accessories.
The joint business of the two was considered similar to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double Willabi’s fortune, which was estimated at 11 million pounds.
While 37-year-old Willaby posted on Instagram that she was leaving True, Jones was on a flight from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
According to one of the sources: "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's top priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would provide her with income in the coming decades.
The decision to leave completely surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
The company’s warehouses in Marlowe are full of products that are ready for sale.”
Experts believe that leaving this morning, one of the UK’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions as a result of massive investments in a variety of products, from pillows and candles to household clothes, and the potential for further delays in launching.
And that could lead to the end of a long friendship.
Willaby, who is a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
Willaby founded True with Cap in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as the company’s chairman in March.
The couple have been vacationing together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin Television Productions.
Willaby will become M&S's ambassador and replace Annette McFertlin as host of I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We’re not responding to his business affairs.”
It was a tough conversation, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he receives from the news media of what some say are “non-presidential” statements and that he is so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said in a “newscaster” voice.
"I haven't made any concessions."
Kim said he was interested in a second meeting after praising their first meeting in June as a major step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "responsive response" from the United States to North Korea's initial disarmament measures.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing with sanctions designed to keep up the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
“We are in a good position with North Korea,” he said.
"We've almost gone to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results — a halt to missile tests, aiding in the release of prisoners and bringing home the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his extraordinary approach to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full stadium, we had about 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing straight ahead.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have destroyed an island and killed hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has lost their homes, no national disaster has been declared, which is a condition for the acceleration of international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it’s a bit of a challenge,” Ms. Sumbong said.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palo, it is not yet clear if foreign envoys will be able to cross the territory.
Mr. Sutupou, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international services were more likely to contribute to the aid effort.
In light of the incessant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains woefully unprepared for natural disasters.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh province, they are rare in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of warning alarms about a tsunami in Palu, even though there is a warning, contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of times, travel between Indonesia’s many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is making its way to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
Improving Indonesia’s fragile infrastructure is at the center of President Joko Widodo’s campaign, and he has invested heavily in roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko is facing funding shortfalls ahead of his re-election bid next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia as a result of the religious radicalization of the Muslim majority in the country.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes in battles between Christian and Muslim gangs in the streets, using knives, bows and arrows and other household weapons.
Video: Daniel Stridge of Liverpool compares at last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Stridge received a delivery from Shaqiri’s office about 30 meters from Chelsea’s goal and his team are down 1-0.
He bounced the ball to his left and then turned a kick towards the far beam.
The ball flew high above the plaza and landed towards the top right corner of the net.
Eventually the ball landed over the gatekeeper Kappa Arisabella who leaped at him, and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get to this position, to get to the ball and players like Shaq are always playing as forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time as possible for myself,” Suridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante and I made one touch and didn’t think about it too much and just kicked.”
Chelsea led 0-1 in half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The "Blue" striker made a pass back to Mateo Kovacic in the same game, before turning near the middle of the field and quickly running into the Liverpool half.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> performed a quick “give-and-go” maneuver in the middle of the field.
And then he kicked a beautiful cross-kick, which led Hauser into the plaza.
Hauser raced the defense and finished with the ball in the top right corner of the goal, with a left kick past Liverpool player Allison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face VIDEOTON in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has climbed to 832, the country’s disaster agency said Sunday morning.
Many people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5-magnitude quake on Friday, which caused waves as high as 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutupou Porvoo Naruho said at a news conference.
The city of Palo, with more than 380,000 residents, was covered in rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
Police opened a murder investigation after the body of a woman was found this morning in Bichenhad, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. on John Street with stab wounds, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are calling people from the area who have seen or heard something to turn to.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohgan said: “The investigation is at its beginning, but I would like to urge anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken a photo with a car camera, to contact us – as the footage may include information vital to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a building.
Friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene this afternoon to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations continue as police say they are now in the process of delivering messages to relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews had just tried to enter his apartment, but was told that police were banning anyone from entering or leaving the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will be hours before they are allowed to return to their apartments.
A police officer is heard telling one person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman was seen at the scene when she was crying.
She comes back and mutters, "It's terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were spotted inside the scene and another outside.
Several police officers were inside the scene directing people in the apartment building.
Anyone with information is requested to send a direct message on Twitter to <0x40>MerPolCC, dial 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and specify the log number 247 as of September 30.
Cromwell's Parliament Statue Becomes Next Target for Attacks on Monuments in Fight Over 'Rewriting History'
The removal of the statue will be poetic justice in light of the Taliban’s expulsion of so many cultural and religious art objects in England.
But the Cromwell Society says Mr. Crick’s proposal is “stupid” and “trying to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that in the current dispute over the removal of statues, the figure of Oliver Cromwell standing outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
The shattering of the statues of the Civil Wars in England was not done by Cromwell's order, nor was it done by him.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell falls victim to the actions of one of his predecessors in the lineage – Thomas Cromwell – in the century before.
Cromwell's impressive representation in the hands of the sculptor Sir William Khammo Thorncroft is testimony to a 19th-century view and part of the historiography of a character that many believe is still worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Crumwell was perceived by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, as defending Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
The question of whether this is an entirely accurate assessment is the subject of an ongoing historical dispute.
An indisputable fact is that the struggle in the mid-17th century shaped the development of our nation further, and Cromwell is one identifiable figure representing one side of the challenger at the time.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and recognition.”
Deadly Pig Drives Chinese Farmer to Death
Local media sources report that a pig has attacked an agricultural death in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified by his family name “Yuan”, was found dead with a torn artery covered in blood near the pig pen at a market in Lufenshui, Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A farmer prepares to inject pig vaccines into a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Shinning, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled on Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and discovered that a door to a pigsty nearby was open.
He said there was a large male pig with blood on his mouth.
A criminal investigation confirmed that the 250-pound pig had fatally attacked the farmer, according to the report.
“My uncle’s legs were full of blood and dismembered,” said his cousin, whose last name was Wu, as quoted in Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Ewan entering the market on Thursday morning at 4.40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked behind bars to prevent him from attacking other people as police gathered evidence at the scene.
It was reported that there were negotiations between Yuan’s family and the market authorities regarding compensation for his death.
Although rare, it has been reported in the past that pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and husband on their Massachusetts farm and caused a man mortally wounded.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had pinned a farmer in Wales to his tractor until the farmer's wife ran the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the taste of blood may be “trigger.”
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>They just play.
They're like naughty kids, very inquisitive... They don't mean to hurt you.
“We just have to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rains in large areas in the southwest.
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring flooding rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States over the next few days.
The winds in Storm Rosa reached a speed of 135 km/h, that is, a Category 1 hurricane, and as of Sunday at 5 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, the epicenter of the storm is 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a channel begins to form over the Pacific Ocean moving eastward towards the east coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push deep tropical humidity northwards into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, a tropical humidity that will blend in with the approaching estuary will create heavy rains in large areas of the Southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause flash floods and risk landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause the amount of rain to reach 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfalls of 50 to 100 mm are expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially in Arizona.
There may be flash floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is highly recommended to avoid hiking long distances in the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong blowing winds and dust storms.
The approaching channel will bring local rains to parts of the Southern California coastline.
There may be total rainfall of over 13 millimeters, which could cause debris to drift and smooth roads.
This will be the first rain in the area in this rainy season.
Spreading tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and the rain will become stronger and spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October there may be sharp temperature changes all over the United States, while the Arctic is cooling but the tropics remain quite warm.
This condition sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature between short distances.
On Sunday, there is an excellent example of extreme temperature changes throughout the center of the United States.
There are temperature differences of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, prolonged summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
At the beginning of October, temperatures will be warm in most of the central and eastern regions of the United States, ranging between 27 and 31 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
In New York City, the temperature may reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 5 degrees above the average.
The long-term weather forecast shows higher-than-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More Than 20 Million People Watched Brett Kavanaugh's Hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the fascinating testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political debate continues, with news bulletins in the middle of regular broadcasts to announce a surprising development on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that Quano was touching her body while drunk and trying to strip her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in exhilarating testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers was even higher than the report of 20.4 million viewers according to the Nielsen Index.
Nielsen tested average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people who watch the office.
By comparison, this is a spectator audience on a scale similar to that of the football playoffs or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose analysts are passionate supporters of Kavanaugh’s appointment, led the network with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The level of interest remained high after the hearing.
Senator Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican senator’s office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh’s nomination, he was filmed by CNN and CBS photographers as a group of protesters shouted at him as he tried to get into the elevator to attend a hearing on the legal committee.
He stared down for a few minutes as the protesters defied him, all filmed live on CNN.
“I’m standing here before you,” said one of the women.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement saying, before the elevator door closed, that he would say more at the committee hearing.
The broadcasters and cable networks all broadcast live hours later, when the legal committee was about to vote on Kavanaugh's candidacy for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would vote for the nomination only if it was understood that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate over the next week, which were demanded by members of the Democratic minority.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Cons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had power, because it was clear that Republicans would not have a majority to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of ‘playing politics’ over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with Britain’s future and harming the national internet, in an interview given to the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview that appeared alongside her idea on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her “game of checkers” plan for Brexit, saying that the suggestion that Britain and the EU would back each other’s tariffs was “completely unfounded.”
Wade Simms shooting: Police arrested Deaton Simpson as suspect in LSU player murder
Police arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting of Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for the LSU team.
A 20-year-old man named Deaton Simpson has been arrested and jailed for first-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials released a video of the standoff between Simms and Simpson, and police said Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said Simpson's DNA was found on them, according to a report by WAPB, which is part of CBS.
After the Simpson investigation, police said he confessed to shooting Wade to death.
The bail was set at $350,000, as reported by Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Pathology Institute published a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and into the neck.
The police gave credit to the task force to catch fugitives in the Louisiana State Police, the state police’s criminal laboratory, Southern University police, and civilians in the area who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU’s athletics director, Joe Alva, thanked the region’s law enforcement for “adherence and the pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
In the previous season his average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“That’s what you’re afraid of all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano spewing ash over Mexico City
Ashes ejected from the Foucault Plateau reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over the course of 24 hours.
In the center, a number of noises and tremors were detected.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering windshields of cars in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity on the volcano, which lies 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the capital city, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists as anniversary of independence vote approaches
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police forces to disperse demonstrations, while thousands more joined anti-government protests marking the first anniversary of the party’s vote on Catalan independence.
A group of masked separatists who were stopped by police to disperse demonstrations, threw eggs at police and sprinkled paint powder, creating black dust clouds on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Clashes broke out later that day as police were forced to use batons to overcome the protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups sang “We will not forget, we will not forgive” in front of the supporters of unity who called “Long live Spain.”
The local press reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained by the protesters.
Tensions remained high in pro-independence areas a year after an October 1 referendum was ruled illegal by the Spanish government, but celebrated by Catalan pro-independence supporters.
Voters voted overwhelmingly to become an independent state, although the turnout was low when those who opposed separation boycotted the vote.
Catalan authorities reported that nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent polling across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups set up night camps on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different route.
Narcisse Thrams, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he had lost hope about Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
Last year we had our best moments.
I’ve seen my parents cry with joy that they can vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although the Catalan separatist parties won an important, albeit narrow, victory in last December’s election, they struggled to maintain momentum this year when many of their best-known leaders are in voluntary exile or in jails awaiting trial for their role in the referendum, followed by the declaration of independence.
Juan Foig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police support demonstration on his phone, said the clash was being fanned by politicians on both sides of the fence.
“It’s getting worse and worse,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Yonkers, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since late last year, announced he would run for European Parliament next year.
“To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regressiveness of democratic values and the repression we have witnessed from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: A number of men arrested after a car rammed into the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car rammed several times into a Londonderry house.
The event took place in Blainegarg Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 UK time.
Detective investigator Bob Belmings said there was damage to the gates as well as to the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point an arrow was fired from the bow towards the car.
Manga kick gives Livingstone a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Manga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, who just made it to the league, stunned Rangers and coach Steven Gerard that it was only his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Manga's kick meant a lot because Gary Holt's team moved up with Hibernian in second place.
Jarrar's team is left without a home win in the Premier League this season, and will face the leader Harts, behind whom she is eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone is extending the home loss streak to six games, and head coach Holt has not yet experienced a break since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against a weak host
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before they scored a goal, when their directness caused the Rangers to have various problems.
Scott Robinson burst forward but dragged his attempts before a goal, and then Allan Lith Goy could only focus his efforts across the board after slipping in to meet Craig Helget's lead before the goal.
The hosts were willing to allow the Ranger to play in front of them, knowing that they could make it difficult for the host team to take free kicks.
And that's how the decisive gate came about.
The Rangers took a free kick and Livingston created an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined in to block Manga, who made a touch and scored a goal from the center of the plaza.
At this point, the Rangers controlled the possession of the ball but discovered that the protection of the house was impenetrable, and the doorman Liam Kelly remained almost unthreatened.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos did force Kelly to save the gate.
Scott Pitnam was stopped at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Lith Goy touched a wide ball from another Levigaston free kick.
Crossballs continued to enter Livingston's plaza and bereavement, while two penalty balls - after a misdemeanor of gleaning for replacement Glen Middleton - and one for touching a hand - were removed.
'Amazing' from Livingston - Analysis
Alastair Lamont, BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Amazing game and amazing result from Livingston.
All the players were excellent, and continued to exceed expectations in this upward momentum.
Their style of play and the players’ staffing have hardly changed since their return to the lead position, but Holt should be given a lot of credit for the way he has consolidated the team since his arrival.
He had so many stars.
Captain Holkett was formidable, leading a remarkably organized defense, while Manga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Waral at high alert all along the way.
But the Rangers were uninspired.
Although they were quite good at times under Jarrar, they did not meet these standards.
They lacked the final ball—only once did they open up the home team’s defense—and that’s a red light for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the field.
Mixed reception for Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday.
This is the last day of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at repairing relations between the two NATO allies.
They were divided on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the European Union.
From there Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an continued to participate in the opening of a new huge mosque.
Cologne is the city with the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police have announced security reasons for blocking 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters have gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters, many of them Kurds, also spoke out in protest against both Erdogan’s policies and Germany’s decision to welcome him in the country.
Opposing protesters reflect the controversy surrounding the guest that some Turks in Germany praise as a hero and others denounce as a tyrannical.
Auto accident in Deptford: Cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of the streets of Stwood and Evelyn, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped and medics treated the wounded, but the man died instead.
The crash came after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childer Street, about a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
Police said they were trying to identify the victim and inform his relatives.
There are roadblocks and buses for alternative routes, it is recommended that drivers avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Prisoners Injured in Riot
Six inmates were injured in a riot in a men's secure prison, the prison's office said.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 p.m., and it still continues.
Special officers from the Tornado unit were brought to the scene to eliminate the riot, which included eight prisoners and was jammed into one wing.
Guards were treated at the scene for minor injuries to the inside.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially skilled prison guards were recruited to deal with an ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six guards were treated for injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those involved will be handed over to the police and their jail terms may be extended.”
Long Lartin Prison has 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the governor of the prison was treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called to the prison to deal with a serious riot in which guards were attacked with snooker sticks.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (former areas may benefit)
It’s rare that a tropical depression hits Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s expected to happen early next week, when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cross the desert in the southeast and bring danger to flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already declared a flash flood hazard on Mondays and Tuesdays for western Arizona into southeast Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Storm Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday and approach late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have remained in tropical storm or sinking status within 322 km of Phoenix since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 60 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the Arizona Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm on the edge of Arizona's Mogollon.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to receive 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated places receiving a total of 50 mm.
For those who are outside the flood-risk zone, the rain of the Rosa storm may be a blessing because the area has suffered from drought.
Although floods are a serious danger, some of these rains will be helpful because the southwest region is currently suffering from drought conditions.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring, more than 40 percent of Arizona is in severe drought, which is the second most severe category,” Weather.com reported.
First, the route of the Rosa storm will reach land throughout the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Storm Rosa, still in hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at about 20 km/h.
The storm comes across cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and is therefore weakening.
It is therefore expected to land in Mexico with the force of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Rains across parts of Mexico can be heavy and cause severe flooding.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Total rainfall of 75 to 150 mm is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a chance of up to 250 mm,” reports weather.com.
After that, the Rosa storm will continue into Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical rift, which will then continue across Arizona into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The main danger expected from a Rosa storm, or its remnants, is heavy rains in Baja California, southwest Sonora and the southwestern desert in the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause flash floods, life-threatening flooding in the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace area on Sunday around 4:00 p.m.
He was taken to the hospital where he remained in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset area, according to the flotilla.
The police are asking anyone who may have mobile phone footage of what happened to contact the police.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the wickedness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the absurdity and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “suffered the convictions, the anger” of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and passionately denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at a hearing about her accusation.
The president said on Saturday that "the people of the United States saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh’s appointment is a vote to confirm the appointment of one of the most outstanding legal minds of our time, a jurist with an excellent record of public service,” he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s appointment as he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections.
“Five more weeks until one of the most important votes in our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I’m actually a candidate,” he said.
“And that’s why I’m running everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission to “resist and interfere.”
A senior Republican aide told CNN that the first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds Killed in Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami, Number Rises
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them washed up in huge waves that crashed on beaches when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, official sources said on Saturday.
Very many people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palo on Friday, when waves carrying a height of 6 meters (18 feet) crashed on the beach at sunset, and many swept to their deaths and destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami was triggered by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach and didn’t immediately escape, and they fell victim,” said Sutupou Porvoo Noroho, a spokesman for the BNPB Disaster Management Agency, in a briefing in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground,” Noroho said, adding that the tsunami had advanced over the open sea at 800 km (497 mph) before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and they survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
Aerial footage released by the disaster agency showed the destruction of a large number of homes and shops, curved bridges and courses and a mosque surrounded by water.
There was a lot of shaking in the beach town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s powerful quake was 200 times larger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
He said the geography of the city, which sits at the edge of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
He described the destruction as "huge" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Noroho said the death toll and damage could be higher along North Palo with a 300-kilometer (190-mile) coastline, an area called Dongla, closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The media "completely collapsed and there is no information" from Dongla, Noroho said.
More than 300,000 people live in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not announcing that a tsunami had hit Palo, although officials said the waves had come at the time of the warning.
In an amateur video posted on social media, you can see a man on the roof of a building shouting hysterical warnings about the tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashes on the beach, carrying buildings and cars.
The Reuters news agency was not immediately able to confirm that the photo was authentic.
The quake and tsunami caused widespread power outages that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but survivors are still in desperate need of food and other essentials.
The city’s airport is only open for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the rescue centers in Palo on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami has climbed to more than 800.
It's very difficult.
As World Vision members from Dongla arrived safely in the city of Palo, where workers sheltered in concrete shelters erected in the courtyards of their offices, they passed mirrors of destruction on their way, Mr. Dussava said.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's very difficult.
Even as aid groups began the unfortunate operations of moving disaster relief gears, some complained that they had been prevented from reaching the Palau of highly experienced foreign aid workers.
According to Indonesia’s regulations, it is possible to start the flow of funding, supplies and people from other countries only if the affected area is declared a national disaster area.
This thing hasn't been done yet.
“This is still a regional disaster,” said Olia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we will be able to open the door to international aid, but this status has not yet been announced.”
As the second night fell on Palo after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing held out in the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that light up the grim stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been buried under rubble for two days, with the body of her mother by her side.
Gandon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliding parachutes for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the hotel saw, among them Mr. Mandagi, his students.
“As a veteran of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gandon recalled how in the hours after news of the collapse of the Seer Hotel circulated among the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palo, who took part in the beach festival.
His messages, however, showed only one grey check mark, instead of the pair of blue marks.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while filling out an ATM at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 from a Brinks worker who filled an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to bring in more money, researcher Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “runs behind a Brinks employee” and steals a bag with money to fill in at the ATM.
A witness saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The entity that was known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed “Ye” for some time now and he used the nickname as his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation due to "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being short for his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible the word means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year when he spoke about the name of his album with radio broadcaster Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the one and only, to just “Ye”—just a reflection of the good in us, the bad in us, or the confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He's one of some famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs became known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names “Love” and “Brotherly Love.”
West’s former partner, Jay-Z, also moved between versions of his name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's president has vowed not to use military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches its 50th anniversary of bloody student repression.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday in Taltulco Square “never to use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Armed forces fired on a nonviolent demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people as left-wing student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing financial support to those studying and opening more public universities for free.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities were pushing young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double funding for artificial intelligence
As China’s AI business grows, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in AI research, says Kai-po Lee, an AI researcher who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after various parts of the U.S. government issued statements about AI, even when the U.S. government does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to be number one in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Doubling the research budget in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence,” Li said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next big AI breakthrough will be achieved in the United States, he told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in China’s most prominent AI company, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the first-ranked reversi player in the U.S., and later served as a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the agency’s robotics challenge for advanced research projects, and asked when she would be next to help identify the next visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to win government grants, he told me.
“It’s not China that’s taking us to the top researchers in academia, it’s the business companies that are doing it,” Li said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited university stars to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Li said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think you should automatically offer a green card to people with a PhD in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council released its next-generation AI development program.
The China National Fund for Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations administer the U.S. Department of Appropriations for Researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a joint artificial intelligence center designed to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an artificial intelligence initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, a U.S. legislative initiative to create a national security committee for artificial intelligence has been inactive for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that prevented it from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, says its northern neighbor’s name is a claim to Greek territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the European Union.
The two countries signed a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the number of voters would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: “Are you in favor of joining NATO and the European Union upon acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, argue that it is a price worth paying so that Macedonia, one of the countries created by the dissolution of Yugoslavia, can join bodies such as the European Union and NATO.
“I came today to point out the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live in freedom under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a protected life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olibra Giorgisbeka in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will abide by the results of the vote to make it a determining factor.
To change the name, it would take a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no irregularities as of 1:00 p.m.
However, the percentage of voters was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, in which 66 percent of those with the right to vote came to vote.
“I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said Jos<0xC3><0xA9> Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, his wife Zorika and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko are putting together their ballot in Stromitsa, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country’s name, which will open the door for her to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament house in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and chairs in front of tents set up by those who boycotted the referendum.
“We are in favor of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with a straight head, not through the entry of the servants,” Kavardrakov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have respect.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian union.”
Prime Minister Zeev said NATO companies would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
“I believe the vast majority will be in favor of more than 80 percent of our citizens supporting the EU and NATO,” Zeev said after voting.
He said a positive outcome would be “securing our future.”
A survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum — less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by the Macedonian television network Telma TV, found that 57 of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote “yes.”
For a referendum to succeed, the percentage of voters must be at least 50 percent plus one.
The failure of the referendum will be the first significant loss of pro-Western government policy since it took power in May last year.
Video: Manchester City player, Sergio Aguero, navigates through all of Brighton's defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahih Sterling broke Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win by Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It looked like Aguaro was taking the gate lightly.
The Argentine pioneer received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before breaking into the open field.
At this point, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one shield before he got a few more shields running on Brighton's wide border.
And then he kicked a pass to the left, and found Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch in the plaza to deliver the ball back to Aguero, who kicked Brighton's goalkeeper, Matteo Ryan, on the right, with a ball to the right of the net.
“Aguaro has problems with his feet,” Manchester City’s manager told reporters.
“We agreed that he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Containers the starting edge in their rivalry in the Premier League.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguaro received the ball deep in Brighton's territory during this time.
He sent a great cross ball along the right flank to Leroy Sanne.
Sana rolled the ball before leading Sterling in the direction of the far beam.
The sky-blue player pushed the ball into the net just before he slid off the field.
Manchester City will face Oppenheim at the Champions League home game on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sheerer wants to play spoiler against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was no good reason to force another start.
But a highly competitive reservist hopes to win Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications for the playoffs for the Rockies, who lead one game for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies had at least booked an open-ticket spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but had not yet secured the first place in the house.
“Although we are playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the spectators and the other team will play at the highest level probably at any point I face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to deal with it?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the starter for Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to let Sarzar serve in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be his 34th starter, held a Bolfen training session on Thursday and will serve on his day of rest - Sunday.
Washington's right-hand pitcher has an 18-7 record with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 knockouts in 220 rounds 2/3 of the season.
Trump held a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly hinted at the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of Republicans coming to vote in the midterm elections.
Everything we did was at stake in November.
Five more weeks for the most important election of our lives.
It’s one of the most, the most — I’m not running, but I’m actually running, so I’m running everywhere and fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump went on to say, “You see this horrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And if you're determined to take back the power by any means necessary, you see the wickedness, the meanness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “resist and interfere.”
“And you’ve seen it for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and mean and mean and mean and dishonest.”
He mentioned the minority leader on her behalf on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, drawing loud calls from the public.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I waited until -- it was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a pluralistic place.
They are not tolerant of those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists at my local party branch voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
After all, I’m the last in a line of Labour MPs who were told they weren’t welcome – and only because we expressed our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the decision to censor me criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe – ironically, similar issues to those Jeremy disagreed with previous party leaders.
The committee for the East Nottingham Libertarian Party meeting on Friday said: “We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a Labour member of the local parliament, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday evening were exactly like this.
As it stands today, this is not the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of “more gracious, gentler” politics has long since been forgotten, if ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party has no tolerance for different views, and each opinion is judged to be acceptable to the party leadership.
This situation began shortly after Jeremy was elected party leader, when colleagues who had previously thought we shared a similar political view began to expect him to make a U-turn and take positions that I would otherwise never agree to – whether on national security or on a single European market.
Whenever I speak in public — and it doesn’t really matter what I say — an abusive stream of social media commentary with calls for impeachment immediately comes in, denouncing the politics of the center and calls that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I’m more fortunate than many of my colleagues, because the comments that are directed at me tend to be political.
I am touched by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of racist abuse every day but never withdraw.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn last week argued that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are already in the same pluralistic place, and with every “distrust” decision or change in the rules of the election, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years many have advised me to keep my mouth shut, not to be so loud and then I’ll be fine.”
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, rattled by the neglect of the Thatcher government that almost caused my public school class to fall apart, I’ve been looking for how to fight for better social services for those who need them most – whether as a local councillor or as a minister in the government.
I have never concealed my political views, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could in any way be confused about my political views and my issues of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted Friday’s decision, all I have to say is that while the country is crawling toward a Brexit that will hurt our families, our businesses and our public service, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But to be honest, the one message I have is not for the momentum movement in Nottingham, but for my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of impeachment or political utilitarianism will deter me from acting in a way that I believe best serves the interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Air to the Peak
The final result was slightly delayed by the last two freshmen, but there is no doubt that Eyre deserves to win the entertaining and wonderful game played today in the Scottish Premier League.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the teen.
Ultimately, it was their better defense, as well as much more risk-taking, that played for the home team, and coach Peter Morchi had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve stood the test of our games so far, and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of the Melrose Group said: “Layer deserves all the credit, they took risks better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute Trey, who was converted by Fraser Clemo, put Air in the lead position, but a yellow card for Scottish national team player Rory Hughes released to the game by the Warriors allowed Melrose to score points and Jason Baggott caught Trey who was not converted.
Clemo brought up Air's lead with a foul, before he scored at exactly halftime, and then converted Trey Solo to get 17-5 to Air at halftime.
But Melrose opened the second half well, and Patrick Angerson's new game, played by Baggott, narrowed the gap to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Rudrich Knott, who was taken away on a stretcher, and starting with the game's renewal, Eyre increased the gap through Stafford McDowell's Trey, which was converted by Clemo.
Acting Air Captain Blair MacPherson then took a yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of the other man with a non-Homer Trey by Bruce Colvin, ending a sequence of intense pressure.
But the home team recovered, and when Stroan Hatchinson received a yellow card for attacking Clemo without a bullet, McPherson scored a touchdown behind Aire’s progressive hustle.
Clemo converted, as he had almost done since returning to the game, after Kyle Roy S. was kicked in by David Armstrong and sent the winger Greger Henry to Trey VI of the home team.
Star Still Game Looks Ready for a New Career in Restaurants
Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears ready to move into the restaurant industry after it was revealed that he was named manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC television show, which he writes and in which he co-stars with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the next season will be the final season of the show, and it looks like Kernan is planning life after Krylling.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was looking for ways to enter the thriving restaurant business in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia that cannot find the sea hopes that the court will open a path to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters wrapped in a La Paz hull.
Public buildings fly a blue-sea flag.
Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon carry the slogan: “The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to demand it back.”
Across unseaworthy Bolivia, the memory of a lost coastline in favour of Chile in a bloody confrontation over resources in the 19th century is still alive—as is the yearning to set sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes may be at their peak for decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of discussions.
“Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course it expects a positive attitude to come,” said Roberto Clasidella, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will lament the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Hague Court will decide in favor of Bolivia’s demand that after decades of fragmented talks, Chile be forced to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea for Bolivia.
Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, Evo Morales, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, will be hanging over the decision on Monday.
“We are very close to getting back to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But commentators believe that there is little chance that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favor – and that even if it decides in its favor, it won’t change much.
The United Nations court in The Hague has no authority to grant Chilean territory, and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice came only six weeks after hearing the concluding arguments indicates that the case was “not complex,” but Paz Zarata, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's claims, it's possible that even the last four years have weakened them.
“The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current administration in Bolivia,” Zarata said.
Morales’s war rhetoric wiped out any remaining goodwill on the part of Chile, she said.
“Someday Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Velezza, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a “great opportunity to open a new era in relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disputes for the benefit of both sides,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – was using the maritime issue as a political lever.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgment is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea says denuclearization won't happen unless it can trust the United States
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong, said his country would never disarm first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His remarks come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of reopening diplomatic talks on nuclear weapons that have reached a stalemate more than three months after a summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a “dream in Spain” to think that continued U.S. sanctions and resistance to declaring an end to the Korean War would force North Korea to kneel.
The United States is afraid to accept the declaration without North Korea first taking significant steps toward denuclearization.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that North Korea is serious about giving up its stockpile of nuclear weapons, in which it is likely to see the only way to protect its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion show reveals new trend with huge hats found on its way to luxury stores everywhere
The solution is found for anyone who wants to expand their hat collection or get total protection from the sun.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a host of huge and crazy headgears for their SS19 collection at a fashion show that stunned the fashion scene at Paris Fashion Week.
Unpractically impractical hats have captured Instagram this summer, and these designers have brought their extraordinary creations to the runway of fashion shows.
Valentino’s signature item was an oversized beige hat decorated with wide feather-like fringes that covered the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included decorated watermelons, a magician’s hat and even pineapples – but they were not meant to protect the head from the cold.
Tom Brown also revealed a selection of strange masks - check in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks included furry lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than Hot Cuter.
One piece mentioned a diving mask including snorkel and glasses, and another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And for those who want to continue with a fashion statement of enormous proportions, their time has come.
Fashion commentators predict that the giant hills are making their way to luxury stores everywhere.
The giant hats are the next hit after La Bomba, the half-meter-diameter straw hat observed on everyone’s head, from Mariana to Emily Rataykausky.
Label the cult behind the very impractical hat that flooded the social networks spawned another large piece on the track—a sea bag almost as big as the swimsuit model who carried it.
A burnt-out color relaxation bag, with the hem of loose locks and a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacqueline Le Rivera’s SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and big sea bags to go to the luxury stores next summer – because the design made a huge impression and it’s going to be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continues in 2018 with an additional set of outstanding test results, reinforced by individual and group success in sports, the arts, music and other areas of practice in the community.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for careers in which they will be chosen and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing a personalized curriculum, we discover that modern languages continue to gain popularity as a sought-after field of study in school.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it gets into his head.
If you talk to a man in his own language, it goes into his heart.”
This is an important reminder that we can’t just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the latest tests this year, you can see that languages are at the top of tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high A score.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a high A score in Mandarin, as did 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish.
These data show that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and youth will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today the field of languages as a subject of choice is considered at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the British Council for Employment and Skills found that among the reasons employers cited Cody to fill vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, to an increasing degree, language skills are becoming an essential necessity to prepare students for future careers.
In view of the increase in language requirements for future job opportunities, these skills are essential in a world of globalization.
No matter what career a person chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a significant advantage in the future thanks to this lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically position a person in a position of advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language at a sufficient level to have a conversation, and French was the only language in which there was a double-digit number of speakers, 15 percent.
That’s why it’s important to invest today in teaching languages to children.
Knowledge of many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, every school will be different in terms of the languages taught in it.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be most important for Britain in the 20th century, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever the child’s area of interest, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in independent schools, with a staff of teachers specializing in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, in any foreseeable future.
It cannot be denied today, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so this fact should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland’s children.
It's the order of the hour.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools.
LeBron is expected to play for the Lakers for the first time on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait ended for fans waiting to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Laker coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the pre-season game against Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
He has not yet decided how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” the Lakers’ official website said.
Laker reporter Mike Trodel tweeted that James would likely play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers preseason games.
“At this stage of my career I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump's rally hour in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump opens with a flood of election rallies tonight in Willing, Virginia.
This is the first of five planned Trump rallies this week, including in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While voting to approve his appointment to the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking to build support ahead of the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 19:00 Eastern Standard Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week’s hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct and led to the postponement of the Senate vote a week as the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the main goal of this rallying flood is to help Republicans facing a challenging election in November gain some momentum.
Therefore, President Trump’s campaign said that the goal of these five rallies next week is “to energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so critical to his agenda that the president is willing to visit as many countries as possible as he enters the tight election season,” Trump’s campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The rally, which is planned to take place at Wesbanko Stadium in Willing, could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw press coverage from the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president needs to come in to try to improve his standing in the polls,” said Simon Haider, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows willingness to fight to keep hope ahead of Sunday's singles games
After three one-sided sessions, the quarterfinals on Sunday afternoon are probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needs.
Momentum’s driving pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but the players really believe in it, and never more than in competitions like this one.
So where do they think we'll find the momentum now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so you can see that as a bit of momentum,” said Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe is in the lead, of course, four points ahead with 12 more in the game.
But Americans, as Speith says, feel like they have a bit of spirit in the sails, and they have a lot to cheer about, and not the last of them in the shape of Speith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each of them boasts three points out of four.
Sepith was a deadly T-El Green and is a personal example leader.
The shouts of joy grew stronger as his round continued, sinking a critical pat to win the all-square four game and Thomas dropped two after two.
His pat that won the 15on won a similar outcry, the kind that shows he believes the American team still has hope.
“You really just have to dig deep and worry only about your own game,” he said.
That's all that's left for each of these players to do.
18 dimples to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Sophie and Thomas over the past two days are M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed lead story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but charming pair of Europe are four out of four and win the sympathy of all.
"Mollywood" were the only pair that didn't shoot the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That round, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic crowd, is based on the fact that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinary to sign the potential European victory with the sun set on the Le Golf National.
Better both at the same time in different directions.
However, it is too early to talk about European glory.
Doll and Tason Webb Simpson ended up with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he was set up with Alex Nor<0xC3><0xA9>n.
Bogey and two doubles in the front nine lowered the Spaniards and the Swedes to a hole they hadn't come near to get out of.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you out of the hole.
It’s fascinating to look closely at the four balls and the quads because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe played better as a team so far and lead significantly towards the final day, but this fourth session showed that the U.S. team was full of a spirit of battle that some, especially within the United States, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 for Ryder Cup final day
Europe are in a healthy lead ahead of the Ryder Cup’s final day after finishing the four-ball and four-seater games on Saturday with a 10-6 win against the United States.
The inspirational duo Tommy Fleetwood and Vernescu Molinari led the change with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods, raising the gap so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn's European side, who tried to defend the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the Americans who missed the four-ball games this morning, bringing the series to 3-1.
The U.S. players showed more resistance in the quarterfinals, winning two games, but were unable to close the gap.
To keep holding the Cup, Jim Forrick’s friends need eight points from the 12 individual games.
Fleetwood is the first European tycoon to win four points in a row, while he and Molinary, who were nicknamed "Mollywood" after an outstanding weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball games, they continued in a miraculous harmony to defeat weakened Woods and American rookie Bryson DeChambaugh with an even more pronounced result of 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed random outbursts of excellence, but has so far lost 19 of the 29 games of the four balls and fours, and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning four-ball games, returned to join Henrik Stanson in the fourth games to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copeca, who are ranked first and third in the world.
However, it wasn’t all that easy for European players in the pleasant weather and breeze that took place southwest of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a 2 and 1 away victory over John Ram of Spain and Ian Poulter in the four-ball games and later returned to defeat Pelter and Rory MacLeroy 4 and 3 in the fourth games, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team returned from a negative four-point gap to the singles games, although as holders of the Cup, Forik's people only need a draw to continue holding the Cup.
However, after standing in second place for two days, it appears that a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says ‘under no circumstances’ it will not unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions deepens its mistrust of the United States and that there is no way the country could unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho announced at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and a commitment to no longer develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see any consistent response from the U.S.,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be certain of our national defense and under such conditions, and under no circumstances will we unilaterally denuclearize ourselves first.”
While Sherry repeated North Korea’s well-known complaints about the U.S.’s opposition to a “gradual” approach to nuclear disarmament that North Korea would be rewarded while taking gradual steps, his statement seemed important in that it did not reject the prospect of nuclear disarmament, as North Korea had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work toward a “nuclear denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump promised to protect North Korea’s security.
North Korea has sought an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States has also opposed calls to reduce international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and even opposes ‘declaring an end to the war’,” Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can cause us to kneel is a dream in the assemblage of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the worsening sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president stressed in his UN speech earlier in the week.
Instead, he stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the other side of the nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a dead end.”
Still, Ri’s tone was dramatically different from last year’s, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that an attack on U.S. soil by North Korean missiles was inevitable after “Mr. President of Evil” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened “total destruction” of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea’s denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a specific time frame for doing so, adding: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia have argued that the U.N. Security Council should reward North Korea for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue with determination and without hindrance until we achieve a complete and verified final denuclearization.”
The U.N. Security Council has unanimously backed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for its ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said later that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not a good one.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for making “gangster demands.”
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear facility if the U.S. takes "corresponding steps."
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding steps" he wanted included security guarantees Trump had pledged in Singapore, as well as changes to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year teaches participants how to sleep more, in an effort to combat the ever-expanding macho culture of learning by staying up all night with caffeine.
Academic research has found that students at the number one university in the world often have no idea about the basic principles of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Casseler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and an expert at the Brigham & Jimens Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to open the course after a lecture he gave about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are you only telling me this now, in my senior year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told the Telegraph.
The course, which is delivered for the first time this year, explains to students the principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall condition.
Paul Briera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and senior director of health services at the university, said the university had decided to open the course after discovering that students had suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part is shown a picture of a dorm room, where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, sports clothes and books - to get explanations about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of walking to sleep.
In another section, participants are told how persistent sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, if interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students overnight.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,” said Prof. Zyzler.
He said the culture of pride about “sleepless night success” still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students are causing the problem of sleep deprivation to grow.
Worrying about adequate sleep, and good sleep quality, should be every student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said – even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep shifts the brain to a hungry state, so we’re constantly hungry.
Raymond Sue, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Zyzler design the course after attending one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course brightened his eyes and motivated him to encourage a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar teaching program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Zeisel recommended that students explore the possibility of setting a clock that would ring when it was time to go to bed, and not just when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitting electronic screens and LED lighting, which can violate the circadian rhythm and thus cause sleep problems.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's Gate Crucial to Gerard's Players
The Rangers suffered another bout of loss in a away game when Dolly Manga caused Stephen Gerard's rebel players a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox had hoped to win their first away game since the February 1–4 win in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerard's second loss in 18 games as manager and left the team eight points behind the running Harts of the Scottish Premier League.
Manga attacked seven minutes before halftime and the uninspired Rangers didn’t seem to compare.
While the Rangers now drop to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and just behind Hibernian by a margin.
And there may be a double-double waiting for the Rangers after Kavan Callum Spence needed treatment for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown at him from the stands.
Gerard made eight substitutions in a team that passed Aire to the semi-finals of the Cup in Teppard.
Holt, on the other hand, came up with the 11 Livingston players who took a point from Harts last week, and he could have been pleased with the way his players beat opponents in any situation.
The Rangers may have controlled the possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They almost scored in the second minute when Manga sent a ball to Scott Fatman who kicked to Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfield player kicked the ball too far.
Then a deep free kick by Keegan Jacob found Captain Craig the Hulkett, but his defender Alan Lathaway could only kick out of the beam.
The Rangers did take control, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have been fined after a quarter of an hour of play, when he and Steven Lowells clashed, but Judge Stephen Thomson waved against the Colombian player's pleas.
The Rangers only managed to kick twice to the goal in the first half, but Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily blocked the lead of Lhasa Coulibaly and Obi Ajaria’s weak kick.
While Livingston's 34th minute opening was at odds with the way the game went, no one will deny that they deserved it at least for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed to tackle Jacobs' deep free ball.
Scott Artfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool by passing it to Manga for a simple final.
Gerard did an act at halftime when he replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the switch brought about an almost immediate effect when the radical/winger inserted a ball into Morlus but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingstone continued to force the guest team to play exactly the type of game she liked, with Lith Goy and Helket continuing to send long balls.
Holt’s team could have increased the lead in the other stages, but McGregor stood up well to prevent Jacobs’ attempt before a twist hit the corner.
Rangers replacement Glen Middleton had yet another charge against Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored it.
Almanac: inventor Monet Geiger
And now stand up from the almanac of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, the day 136 years ago, and continue ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geyer developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the device has become a pillar of science, but in 1950 it also became a pillar of pop culture thanks to the film "Bells of Coronado," starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as two strange cowboys/scientists:
Man: "What the hell is this thing?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put the headphones together, you can actually hear the effects of radioactivity on the atoms in the minerals.”
Evans: "Oh my God, it's really popping right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that carries his name continues to live after him.
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and eliminate them
Immunization teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells as part of treatment
The method includes extracting immune cells from the patient, and changing the cells in the laboratory.
Then the cells can "see" a protein that is shared to many cancers and then they are injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
In one woman who was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells, ovarian cancer disappears for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing the cells in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers, and then injecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berezofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Batsada, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 <0xC2><0xAB>motivates the development of several cancers», including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explained Prof. Berezofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to attack cancerous cells has been successful in treating a type of blood cancer.
Kanye West broke out in a speech in support of Trump, with his head in a MAGA hat, after his appearance in SNL.
It was not well received.
Kanye West responded to boos in the studio during a confused performance on the Sunday Night Live show, praising US President Donald Trump and saying he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song on the show, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great hat, he cracked a speech of rebuke against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So many times I talk to white people who say, ‘How can you love Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL episode began with a sketch starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, regarding Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegations.
Although the speech was not broadcast on the show, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to roll over on West in the trailer.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was being criticized behind the scenes for the hat he was wearing.
They attacked me behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t go out on stage with that hat on your head.”
They attacked me!
Then they said I was in a dark place,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the dark place?" Saying that he was putting on my Superman hat, because that means no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to show love.”
His remarks were booed at least twice by the audience, and it seemed that SNL staff members were embarrassed, Variety reported, and one of them told the newspaper: "A deep silence fell in the entire studio."
West was added to the show as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West shocked many when he performed the song I Love It while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by TPUSA's Conservative leader, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for not giving in to the crowd."
But presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter: “Be who he is and it’s absolutely wonderful.”
But I chose not to reward (by buying his music or his clothing or supporting his "art") that I think is an effort and an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
“Me too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that from now on he is “the entity formerly known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy and P Didi.
Another rapper, Snoop Doc, had the name Snoop Lyon, and of course the well-known musician Prince changed his name to Sergeant and later to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Lillehammer.
The suspect is expected to appear before the Belfast court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington attacks toxic manhood
Kit Renton is known as Jon Snow, the swordsman of the medieval fantasy series The Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such on-screen roles often send young children the message that they must be tough to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married another star in the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, admitted that he was “very upset” about handling the issue.
“Personally, I feel very upset right now—where did we go wrong about masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach men in their time of growth, from the point of view of the problem we are now witnessing?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity, due to the highly masculine characters it portrays.
He continued: “What comes from inside and what is learned from outside?
What do we learn from television, and on the street, that makes young children feel they have to be on this particular side of being a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time – how do you change it?
Because there is no doubt that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In an interview, he admitted that he would not participate in any sequel or derivative series of Game of Thrones after the series ends next summer, saying that he “finished with battlefields and horses.”
Starting in November, Keith will star in a remake of Sam Shepard’s play True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his robber brother.
The actor recently discovered that he saw meeting his wife Rose as the best thing that had happened as a result of Game of Thrones.
“I knew my wife in the series, so in this way the series gave me my future family, and my life from that moment on,” he said.
Rose played Yeagrit, the love interest of John Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have the disease, according to health officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been contracted as a result of sex, which is a change from the past.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has shrunk to almost zero, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV infection as a result of having sex is a burning problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality ceased to be illegal in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of infection are the result of not using adequate protective measures in these sexual relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her team leaked information about a Republican senator and condemns “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three U.S. senators on the senators' Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic senator from Los Angeles estimated that the allegations were being spread by “extremely right-wing” websites and critics.
“Lies, lies and more vile lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
According to reports, the information released included the residential addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing before the Senate Committee on Sexual Misconduct Charges against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened some time after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was linked to Waters' office and published the information about a Waters staff member, according to a Hill report.
“This baseless accusation is completely untrue and a complete lie,” Waters added.
“My team member – whose identity and personal details have been exposed and whose security has been compromised as a result of these false and erroneous accusations – was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless accusation is absolutely false and a complete lie.”
Waters' announcement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
“This indicates that she does not have the temperament required of members of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t react in anger.
He can't respond with defiance.
He must not question the motives of the accused.
He has to be calm and peaceful.”
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters’s response to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was blamed by critics who appeared to be too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to defeat Waters in the mid-term election, also tweeted his thoughts.
“Great if it’s true,” he wrote on Twitter.
In her announcement, Waters said her firm had approached “appropriate authorities and law enforcement about these false claims.”
“We will make sure the perpetrators are discovered,” she continued, “and that they will be prosecuted for all their destructive and dangerous acts against my teammates.”
Johnny English 3.0 – A weakened spy parody starring Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to look for meanings about Brexit in any new film with a British perspective, and it does seem appropriate for this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy parody – which began somewhere in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returning.
Will an ironic self-slap on how worthless we are become the new export opportunity for our country?
In any case, the gaping-eyed and rubber-faced Johnny English got another chance to spoil things – and his name stands out more than anything that’s a broad comic piece for film-goers in non-English-speaking countries.
He is of course the stupid English agent, who despite his strange fascination with the slick glow looks a little like Clouseau, a little Mr. Bean and plenty of this guy who contributes a single note to the fire chariot tone in the opening text of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is also based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson played in the forgotten television commercials for Barclaycard, leaving chaos behind.
There's one or two nice minutes in the latest edition of Johnny English.
I loved the part where Johnny English approached the helicopter wearing a medieval armored garment, and the propeller blades ring for moments on his helmet.
Atkinson demonstrates his comedic physical abilities, but humor feels strangely weakened and unnecessary, especially since the “serious” type of spy films like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now include a comic component.
The humor feels like it’s addressed to children instead of adults, and for Johnny English’s crazy failed adventures, it’s less brilliant and less focused than Atkinson’s silent-movie-style jokes of Mr. Bean.
The film begins when a great danger threatens Britain.
A computer hacker infiltrated the super-secret web of British espionage, revealing the identities of all of Britain's agents on the ground, to the dismay of the chief agent - a small role unfortunately for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for an arrogant, battle-ready prime minister who is already suffering from a total breakdown of losing political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best to fill the role of Theresa May, but she doesn’t have much to work with from the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been exposed, she will have to bring someone back from retirement.
And that means Johnny English is a self-respecting braggart who is now employed as a school principal in a prestigious institution, but gives unofficial lessons in how to be an undercover spy: some good jokes here, when English offers a school-style spy academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former assistant to gauge the suffering of Bough, who is again portrayed by Ben Miller.
Buff is now a man married to a submarine commandant, in the role of an annoying class queen, on whom Vico Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service Synagogue into a terrible entanglement are back in action, with a beautiful Ophelia-like Pam-Fatal played by Olga Korilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously caught in the crosshairs of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems – the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bough begin their odyssey which is more of a farce of two clowns: under the guise of waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant; they create an under-reality as they smuggle themselves into the magnificent yacht of Volta; and English ignites a total anarchy in his attempt to use a virtual reality set to get to know the inner structure of Volta's home.
There is no doubt that all efforts are made to lead to the last sequence, but despite the kindness and playfulness, it has a feeling of television for children.
Quite a mediocre level.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
Labour denies it is preparing a plan for Britons to work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a revolutionary plan under which the British will work four days a week – but will get paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants company executives to pass on the savings as a result of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to workers in the form of an extra day of rest.
I mean, employees have a three-day weekend, and they still get the same paycheck.
Sources said the idea would “fit” the company’s economic agenda and its plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The Trade Union Congress supports a transition to a four-day work week as workers can benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior Labour official told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but this four-day work week is an aspiration that fits the Party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the Party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, with the Green Party calling for a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the ambition is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day work week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it.”
Labour’s candidate for finance minister, John McDonnell, used the party’s congress last week to formulate his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless managers” and “price-expensers” in service companies.
It also follows from the plans of the candidate to the Minister of Finance that current shareholders in water companies may not get their full investment back because the Labour government may make “reductions” based on the discovery of misconduct.
It also confirms that there are plans to add employees to the boards of companies and create “collectively owned funds” to transfer 10 percent of the capital of private sector companies to employees, who will pocket annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John F. Kennedy Tells TV Show '60 Minutes' If FBI Investigation into Kavanaugh Changes Their Mind
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the findings could convince any of the Republicans to withdraw his support.
In an idea aired Sunday on 60 Minutes, reporter Scott Pley asked Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said before the hearing, I said I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, the accusation went up, and I said, ‘Did you do it?’
He was decisive, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham's vote, however, appears to have been carved in stone.
“I’ve already decided about Brett Kavanaugh and there will be a need for a high-profile accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know it: Brett has firmly denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And no person she mentioned could verify that.
It's 36 years old.
I can’t see how anything can change.”
What is the World Citizen’s Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
Saturday New York City will host the Citizens of the World Festival, an annual music event with an impressive list of stars to appear and an equally impressive goal of ending world poverty.
The 7th World Citizens’ Festival will bring tens of thousands of people to the park to not only enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true purpose – to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 World Citizens’ Festival is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to an event (unless you’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert island must complete a series of tasks, or “actions” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, calling or other significant ways to help raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the festival really been, with only 12 more years to go before it achieves its goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free ticket to a concert really a way to convince them to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of “climateivism” — people who feel like they’re really having an impact by signing a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Citizens of the World has documented more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, pushing for a variety of different goals.
He said these actions helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already begun distribution or fundraising.
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and doers committed to “helping children grow to their full potential” and promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Citizens of the World.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and ‘world citizens’ like you, we can turn social justice about malnutrition into a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ullman told the audience during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions had been taken calling for Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced a grant for the project, Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children with nutritional intervention.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website asking, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
“Citizens of the world,” she replied, “it’s going to be a long and difficult road – sometimes we’ll fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monet are among some of the shows to feature at this year’s event in New York City, featuring Deborah-Lee Fornes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy for 'sea blockade' to delay Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
If necessary, Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke argued that Russian involvement in Syria - which is being done, it is important to mention, at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for the expansion of new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, just as they are doing in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States is able, with our fleet, to make sure that the sea lanes are open and when needed, to lay siege to make sure that their energy sources don’t reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were indeed identical.
“The economic possibility for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the leveraging and switching of fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-trick pony” because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration has embarked on a mission to boost its heavy natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russian energy sources, which are a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to cancel its participation in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a Moscow “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is expected to double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion square meters, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s firm opposition to the project is motivated solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure vessel and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The U.S. position was met with a backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Organization (BDI), the leading organization in the German industrial sector, called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempff, head of the German Industrial Organization (BDI), said following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren ‘seriously consider’ running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “seriously consider” running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed her intention to run for president during a meeting at Holyoke City, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government, and for that, we need a woman to lead,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider the presidential race.”
Warren expressed her opinion on President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren sharply criticized Trump for the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge on the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters don’t think she should run for the 2020 election.
Fifty-eight percent of “potential” Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run for office, according to a survey by the University of Suffolk’s Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the intention to run for the senator's presidency.
The survey showed that there was more support for running for former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his run against 48 percent who opposed it.
Linked figures from the Democratic Party that oil has emerged in the context of a possible run-off to the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to the AP.
Sarah Palin marks post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump rally
The 26-year-old Turk Palin spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the army in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s been going through since he came back, allows me to identify with families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and with some of the injuries that our soldiers are returning to,” she told a rally audience for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room” and said of her son and other veterans, “They come back a little different, they come back stiff, they come back and wonder if what they gave the country, their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all the other military personnel, is respected.”
He was arrested on Monday in the Alaskan city of Wesila and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, disrupting the reporting of domestic violence and possession of weapons under duress, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wesila police.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing situations involving gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed a “Friend of the Court” statement on Friday in Washington, D.C., to support the call to challenge asylum seekers’ policies, the NBC reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions' lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Rights Association in August, was not disclosed.
She said her partner, his violent sons, gang members, had abused her, but U.S. government officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace’s state attorneys have described the states of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have filed numerous asylum applications in the United States, as nations facing many problems when it comes to gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the BIA Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented migrants fleeing situations of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia’s attorney general, Carl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“The federal law requires that all discussions regarding asylum applications rely on the facts and special circumstances of the request, and the barrier set by the new policy violates this principle,” the court friend said in a statement.
The lawyers also argued in the affidavit that the policy, which prevents immigrants from entering, is hurting the U.S. economy because they tend to become entrepreneurs and “provide needed work,” they said.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“The political asylum is open to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or because of political opinion,” Sessions said in a policy statement on June 11.
The goal of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palo, while the death toll is doubled, in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more difficult by the minute.
“There’s a very tense feeling,” said 35-year-old Risa Kosuma, a mother of a baby with fever in the center of the evacuees in the devastated city of Palo.
"Every minute the ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is rare.”
Residents appeared to be returning to their destroyed homes, burrowing into water-soaked objects, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were hit by the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5, were flooded.
Some of the injured, including Davy Harris, who suffered back and shoulder fractures, lay outside the military hospital in Palo, where they were treated for severe aftershocks that continued after the earthquake.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted how he felt the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the rubble of the wall, I think," Harris told the AP, adding that his family had been in town to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are in a safe place.”
US ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ with ‘propaganda awareness’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily, while aggressively promoting the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid supplement to the Chinese newspaper China Daily in De Moyen Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, claiming that China had rejected it.
Trump’s accusation that China was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked a new phase, according to U.S. official sources, in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is natural for foreign governments to advertise for trade promotion, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a rising trade war in which each country raises and compares the tariff rates on imported products from its rivals.
The tariffs, which China raised as a retaliation early in the trade war, were meant to hurt exporters from countries like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, U.S. and Chinese experts said.
Terry Bernstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, a former governor of Iowa for many years, and an important exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Bernstad wrote in an op-ed in the Sunday edition of The Moyen Register, “reinforces bullying by posting ads in our free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses America’s cherished free speech and press tradition, and publishes a paid ad in Des Moines Register,” Bernstad wrote.
“On the other hand, at the newsstand on the streets of Beijing, you’ll find few dissenting voices and you won’t see any real reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have on the worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the proposal to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was about.
Republican Party bans women’s votes ahead of mid-term election with Kavanaugh incident, analysts warn
While many Republican leaders stand with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defend him against a number of sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that they will see a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments around the matter were particularly vivid, and most Republicans are officially demonstrating their desire to move forward with the voting process.
“You can’t take that kind of stuff back,” Grant Reher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Rihr said he doubted that the last-minute efforts of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona Republican) to launch an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday – they are not going to forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the Progressive Movement MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted “November is coming!” as they demonstrated in the Senate corridor, while the Republicans who control the Senate Judiciary Committee chose to continue promoting Kavanaugh’s appointment, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to a report by Mic.
“Democrat levels of enthusiasm and motivation will break new records,” said Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say they’ve been tall; they’re right.
But they can be higher, especially among the floating voices of suburban women and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, despite their dislike of the president, often abstain from voting.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts argued that there could be a backlash if Republicans continued to push for confirmation.
“The nomination has caused serious trouble for Republicans,” Michael Steele, chairman of the former Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just the committee vote or the final vote or if Kavanaugh gets the nomination, it’s also about how Republicans handled it and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans appear to be somewhat divided on the extent of their faith in Ford's and Kwano's testimony, with slightly greater support for Ford.
A recent YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believed with certainty or most likely for Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they believed with certainty or most likely for Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Quano was lying for sure or probably during his testimony, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford as well as allegations made by at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified on oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Cuano attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his penis to her during a party at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Start a New Web to Overcome Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the worldwide Internet, is launching a startup company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of the man who became a legend in the tech world, is a company that will develop Solid, Berners-Lee’s open source platform.
Solid allows its users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be allowed to access the different types of data.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create a “personal online database” or POD.
The database can include a list of contacts, lists of actions to perform, a schedule, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
Imagine that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify will all be available in one browser at the same time.
What sets the personal online database apart is that only the user can decide who can access the information and what kind of information can be accessed.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, Inrupt will find the right resources, process, and capabilities to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Today, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a team of several developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer code programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world will be able to create distributed apps using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not discussing with Facebook and Google their agreement or refusal to introduce a complete change, which would cause a complete and overnight upheaval in all of their business models.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In a post published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission “is to provide commercial energy and an environmental system to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the face of the Internet by founding the W3C organization at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Also during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as founder and director of W3C, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m particularly optimistic about the next era of the network,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: An event to commemorate the clergyman who won the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only Anglican clergyman to have won, as a warrior, the Victoria Cross during World War I was named at an event held in his hometown, 100 years after the victory.
Lieutenant-Colonel and Rev. Bernard Van won the Victoria Cross on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never known to have won the highest British honours.
The memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Raedan, North Hampton, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that the discovery of the stone at exactly 100 after his grandfather won the award was “incredibly symbolic.”
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Van led his battalion across the San-Kentan Canal “through heavy fog and under heavy fire from field guns and submachine guns.”
He then rushed to the line of fire and in "The Greatest Knights" led the line forward before rushing to take over with one hand a submachine gun and dropping three of the company.
Lt. Col. Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, one month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I’ll never be able to compare to, but something that humbles me.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Royal Youth Orchestra.
Michael Van said he was "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the heroism of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to many people."
Fans of the combined martial arts stayed up all night to watch the Blatour 206, and instead got Pepe Pig.
Imagine staying up all night to watch the action of the Baltor 206 and eventually watching the main event is denied you.
The San Jose show featured 13 fights, including six on the main ticket, and was shown live during the night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Jagard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for battle, viewers in Britain remained stunned when the coverage changed to Pepe Pig.
Some of them were not impressed by the change after staying up until early in the morning, especially to watch the battle.
One fan described on Twitter the move to the children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke".
“This is a government regulation that states that at 6 a.m., the original content was not appropriate and therefore they had to switch to the children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Blattor, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig, yeah."
Blatour president Scott Cocker said they plan to work on their schedules to include British viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about the replay, I think we can probably work it out,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there and we won’t be able to solve the problem until Sunday in our time zone, that is, on Monday in their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, during the transition a lot of text messages were exchanged between the parties and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it. We thought it was a technical malfunction.
But no, it was a government problem.
I can assure you that next time it's not going to happen.
We’re only going to have five fights instead of six – as we usually do – we’ve tried to give the fans more and we’ve just overplayed.
It’s a matter of misfortune.”
Previous articleDesert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Disadvantaged’ Because of His Sexual Orientation
Tom Daley, the Olympic jumper, said that as he grew older he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexual orientation — but that feeling motivated him to become a success.
The 24-year-old jumper said he didn’t know until he reached middle school that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, hosted by Laurent Laverne, he said he had spoken out on gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The program's regular host, Christy Young, has been on sick leave for several months.
In his appearance as the star of Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "discomfort" from the others as he grew up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, the feeling of inferiority, and the feeling of being different, have been real things that have given me strength and power and allowed me to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually found out what his sexual orientation was.
The man, who twice won the Olympic bronze medal, has become an outspoken leader of the LGBT community and has used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on other countries to give legal status to homosexuality.
He spoke openly about the issue because he felt fortunate to have been given the opportunity to live openly and without consequences and wanted to give others “hope.”
The triple World Cup winner said falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “catched me by surprise.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years his senior, last year, but he said the age gap had never been a problem.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age” — he attended the Olympics for the first time at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it was hard to find someone his age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said his "whole point of view" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about ‘I need to win a gold medal,’” he said.
You know, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Ruby.
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father had not accepted the fact that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him you wouldn’t be here to be in the front row, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand while his breath stopped and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible,” he said.
A year later, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that this was what I had been dreaming about all my life—diving in front of my home crowd at the Olympics, it didn’t feel better than that,” he said.
This is also what inspired him to choose his first song – Heather Small’s Proud – which he identified with during the preparations for the Olympic Games and which still makes him skin duck.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 a.m.
Michaelson disappointed in performance and came down on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American golfer Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays for the 47th time in the Ryder Cup, but he will need to upgrade the performance so that the event does not become a miserable milestone.
Michaelson, who attends the annual event for the 12th time and sets a record, went down on the bench at the decision of Jim Furrick during the foursomes and the foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as is the practice of playing with the United States national team, Michaelson, who has won the Major Tournament five times, spent half of the day as a cheerleader and the second half working on his game on the sidelines in the hope of correcting the ill evil he suffered.
Even at the height of his career, the actor’s performance suffered from declines and upsurges. Therefore, the 48-year-old Michaelson is not the ideal choice for La Golf National, where the long grass tracks are usually unforgivable for stray batting.
And if the competition itself isn’t daunting enough, Michaelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, competed against the exact British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans’ ambition, who lost four points in the first 12 games, had been to succeed in the early stages, Michaelson’s game could have been decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his player, though we did not expect him to say anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, wrapped his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He has been a member of the Hall of Fame and has added a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's how it developed and that's how we thought it should continue.
“He wanted to be on the track, just like all the other players.
Michaelson will break Nick Paldo’s record with the highest number of games in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may end his Ryder Cup career, which never really matched his personal peaks.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furik said his presence added some intangible advantages to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of people, and it’s fun to be in the dressing room with him,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed having fun with him this week, and it was nice to see that.
It’s a lot more than the game itself.”
European captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn knows the big advantage may soon disappear
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage before the last day of the Ryder Cup singles games could change for the worse.
The Danish started his game at Waldrama in 1997, when his playmate, Grandfather Balestros, had a five-point advantage over the Americans, whom he almost lost by crossing the finish line with a minor advantage and won 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I keep reminding myself that we had a big advantage in Waldrama; we had a big advantage in the game in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Waldrama, where we won but with a small advantage,” Bjorn said in the photo, after watching a 5-3 victory in the 2018 tournament on Friday and yesterday, which led to a 10-6 advantage in the National Golf Club.
So history will prove to me and to everyone on the team that it's not over.
We have to give it all tomorrow.
You have to get on the right track and do all the right things.
It's not over until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal, to try to win a trophy, and we need to focus on it.
“I said all along, I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re very aware of those who stand in front of us on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn was delighted with his players' performance on the difficult golf course and added: "It's important to me never to be late when it comes to golf.
Tomorrow could be completely different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on personal performance, and it's completely different.
It’s a pleasure to be on the track when everything is going well, but when you’re there alone, then your full ability as a golfer is put to the test.
And this is the message that needs to be conveyed to the players: you need to make the most of yourself tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he needs to make the best of himself.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, opposing team captain Jim Furick will expect better personal performance from his players, compared to their performance in the doubles games, except for Jordan Speight and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furik himself knows both the winning and the losing sides, during the important closing days of tournaments of this type, having participated in the winning team in Brooklyn before losing, when the European team that managed to miraculously win the final game, as documented in the film "Miracle at Medinah".
“I remember every word,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had encouraged his players for the final day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but I want to succeed in the early stages, as you saw in Brooklyn, and as you saw in Medinah.
When this momentum shifts to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
“We’re preparing our squad accordingly and putting the guys on track based on the feeling that we have, you know, we’re trying to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and will face Rory McElroy in the top game, with Paul Cassie, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Paulter, who are the rest of Europe in the top half.
“I chose the players in this order because I think he will be able to get us to the final,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said, referring to his singles selection.
Germany's new warship is rejected once again
Germany's new fleet frigate was due to be accepted in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but was delayed at least a year due to faulty systems and reduced costs, local media reported.
The arrival of Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate line, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a report by the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The vessels were supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but worrisome issues after the supply shut down the ambitious project.
All four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class cruises, which were commissioned by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to include powerful cannons, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile batteries, as well as stealth technologies, such as acoustic signatures, reduced infrared and radar.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the newest frigates can be deployed for up to two years away from home ports.
However, repeated delays mean that the innovative ships, which are supposed to allow Germany to send troops overseas, will become obsolete by the time they enter service.
The F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to build ships after its delivery.
Not much is known about the reasons behind the recall, but the German media cited a number of critical “software and hardware deficiencies” that rendered the warship useless for use on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fleet would be operated by about 120 sailors – about half of the crew used in the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship has a dramatic excess weight that reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons and is twice as heavy as the ships the Germans used in World War II.
Apart from the defective software, the price tag of the entire project – which also includes the training of the team – also becomes a problem.
It has reportedly reached a staggering height of 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) – well beyond the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that fascinate the newest frigates become especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartles, head of the German parliament’s security committee, confirmed to the navy that “ships capable of deploying are running out.”
The official source said the problem had picked up and intensified over time, as old ships had been decommissioned but not replaced by other vessels.
He expressed regret that the Navy could not have included a Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate.
The National Trust of Scotland Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to uncover how bats use the landscape to hunt their food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The research conducted by scientists at the National Trust of Scotland will track European bats and European bats, as well as brown and long-eared dubton bats in Inberio Gardens in Worcester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
The National Health Service (NHS) team and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
Specialized voice analysis of all recordings will determine the frequencies of bat readings and which of the species is responsible for them.
In the next step, the map of the living areas will be drawn to create a detailed picture of the size of the landscape, of their patterns of behavior.
Rob Dwar, a conservation consultant for the National Trust of Scotland (NTS) hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of living area management work, such as the creation of meadows and how to best maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are under threat from development and construction work, which affects the nesting and loss of living areas.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, which is also true for fly traps and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their night hunting habits, bat ears are more useful when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo detection techniques to detect insects and detect obstacles to their flight path.
The NTS Foundation, which handles more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 760,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has 10 skilled specialists, who regularly conduct surveys, nesting tests and sometimes even rescues.
The organization also established the first and only reserve dedicated to bats at the Treve estate in Damascus and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The estate manager David Thompson said the estate was the ideal territory for them.
“Here in Trib we have a great area for bats,” he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right living areas.
But many things are still unknown about bats, so the work we do here and in other assets will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of the test for finding bats before carrying out maintenance work within the properties, as unintentional destruction of a single inhabited nest could destroy up to 400 females and cubs, and possibly even destroy an entire local population.
Bats are protected species and the killing, harassment and disturbance of bats or destruction of their nesting areas are prohibited by law.
Elizabeth Pearl, a Scottish official at the Bat Foundation, encouraged the public to give a shoulder and help.
She said: “We have a lot more to learn about our bats and about many of our species we just don’t know what their populations are like.”
Ronaldo dismisses rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him “pike news” and said people “want to promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The pioneer of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Myurga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo, 33, turned to his 142 million followers on Instagram in a live video a few hours after the allegations were made public and called the reports "Pike News".
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>No, no, no, no, no.
“What they said yesterday, Pike News,” said the actor, who won the Balloon d’Or five times.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy person and everything is fine,” the actor added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have referred to as “an unacceptable report of privacy suspicions,” Reuters reported.
Attorney Christian Schr<0xC3><0xB6>tz said the actor would seek compensation for “moral damages in an amount consistent with the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Miorga reportedly returned to the player's room and allegedly raped her in an anal manner, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Myorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her that he was a “good guy” at “99 percent” who was disappointed at “one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that they were consensual.
Miorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an arrangement outside the courthouse because she felt "horrified by acts of revenge" and feared "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to cancel the arrangement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and moved this summer to Juventus in a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK ‘will forever regret’ the loss of automakers
Britain will “regret forever” if it loses its position as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit, said UK Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that Toyota UK's interview with the BBC, in which it said that if Britain left the EU without an agreement it would temporarily stop production at its Branston plant near Derby, was "worrying".
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Branston plant, which makes Toyota’s Oris and Aventis models, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“From my point of view, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we will see a production cut at our plant,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s chief executive at Branston.
Other UK automakers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and how it will affect cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what automakers call “supply chain risks” in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on a “just in time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes, from British suppliers and the rest of the EU, to make cars on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, border disruptions could occur, and sector officials say they could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
Toyota will not be able to hold more than one day’s worth of inventory at a factory in Derbyshire, the company says, so production will be halted.
Clark said Theresa May’s program, which details Britain’s future relationship with the EU, was “accurately calibrated to prevent these border checks.”
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best deal possible, as I said, not only to enjoy success in the present, but also to take advantage of the opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today show.
“The evidence from Toyota and other automakers is that the possibility of continuing to use the successful array of supply chains that we have had to date is absolutely essential.”
Toyota did not say how long the production halt would last, but in the longer term, it warned that the extra costs would hurt factory competitiveness and ultimately lead to layoffs.
Peter Tzuvalaris, who has worked at Branston for 24 years and serves as president of the Unione Factory, said the union members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, if jobs are reduced, they will never be returned.
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, many of which depend on her, could be “suspended for another week” as the battle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia and possible obstruction of investigative proceedings by the president.
The gossip in Washington has for months been about whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and jeopardize Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of carrying a wire to record conversations with Trump and get the president impeached through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he arrived at the White House, and was reportedly about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for Thursday with Trump, who was staying at Rosenstein’s arrival at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but at this point the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, and again postponed the Senate vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
In response to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “No date has been set yet for the meeting, it may take place this week, I can see a delay for another week given what is happening in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I’m always happy to update the press.”
Some reporters will question this assertion: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the host, asked why.
Sanders said the rareness of the briefings was not due to aversion to the "taking a position" of the television scripts, although she said: "I will not deny the fact that they are taking a position."
She then proposed increasing the direct link between Trump and the press.
“The president has more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him,” she said, adding without citing evidence: “We checked the numbers.”
Press briefings will still take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has an opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
"We have tried to do this in many cases, and you have seen that we have done so in many cases in recent weeks, and meetings that will allow us to talk to the president of the United States will replace press briefings."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences during high-profile visits.
His press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated the reason for this, in a loose and sometimes bizarre performance in front of reporters gathered at the scene.
Health Minister Writes to EU Employees at NHS Scotland and Addresses Brexit Concerns
The Minister of Health wrote to the staff of the European Union, employed by the National Health Service of Scotland, to express the country's gratitude and ask that they remain after Brexit.
Scottish Member of Parliament Gene Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the European Union.
The Scottish government has already pledged to meet the cost of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in its distributed public services.
Ms. Freeman wrote in her letter: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the exit continued, and he is moving towards the decisions expected in the fall.
But the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this period can be very concerning for all of you.
So I wanted to go back and say how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the team, regardless of his citizenship.
Fellows from across the European Union and the world bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
“Scotland is definitely your home and we very much want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
The back defender from the University of Tennessee Tiger Group, Christian Abercrombie, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury from the loss of the 31-27 on Saturday to the Commodore Group from the University of Wunderblit, Mike Organ reported from the Tennessee.
Rod Reed, head coach of the University of Tennessee team, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
“He went to the edge of the field and just collapsed there,” Reid said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field and then put him on a stretcher and took him for further examination.
A University of Tennessee official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been transferred to surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details about the type/scope of the surgery" and the University of Tennessee is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is an athletic student and this is his first season with the University of Tennessee after a transfer from Illinois.
He played five tackles in total before leaving the game, raising his total to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK and the extra revenue will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Conservative plan.
The move will neutralize Corbyn's move to attract new voters.
The stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects the tax to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK – the extra revenue will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move appears to be an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters, with promises to provide cheaper housing and focus on high-income earners.
The stamp duty will be imposed on people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the increase in revenues will strengthen the government’s move to help those who are old in difficult conditions.
The payment, which comes as an addition to the current stamp tax, including higher tax levels on secondary residences and real estate investments for rent, could reach a level of three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new properties built in London are purchased by foreign residents, a situation that causes price hikes and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to set foot on the housing ladder.
Many wealthy parts of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut to help young people buy a first home.
He accused large construction companies of taking land but not using it, and urged Ms. May to abandon affordable housing quotas and fix Britain’s “housing frenzy.”
Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent control and a “no-guilt” moratorium on evictions.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my term to the restoration of the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based in foreign countries, can buy homes as easily as hard-working British residents.
“The dream of becoming a homeowner has become too remote for too many people, and the humiliation of sleeping in difficult conditions is too real.”
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his “ultimate ambition” was to become Scotland’s manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman takes delight in the resuscitation challenge of the North-East Club, currently in third place in the first division, three points from the top of the rankings.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after leading St. Mirren back to number one in Scotland in the final season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
“I played an international game once and that’s it,” Ross told the BBC’s Scottish programme Sportsound.
But as I grew up, I watched Scotland play Hampden a lot with my dad as a kid, and it was always something that pulled me back.
In any case, this opportunity will only come if I succeed in managing the team.”
Sunderland's previous managers include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neal, Roy Keane, Gus Foya, and Paolo Di Canio.
Alois Athletic’s former manager says he wasn’t afraid to follow such well-established names in such a large club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>For me, success will now be measured according to <0xE2><0x80><0x9A>Can I return the club to Premier League?
Because of the structure and facilities in this club, there is no doubt that it belongs to the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I can only see myself as a success story here if I can bring the club back.”
Ross began his management career only three years ago, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as a team coach for Hearts.
Next, he helped Alois out of League C and raised St. Mirren from the bottom of the abyss to her championship status the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his acting career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkrick, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It must have been a real junction,” he recalls, regarding taking command of Eloa.
“I really believed that the management position was better than the game.
It sounded weird because I was playing okay, making a reasonable profit, and enjoying some reasonable records.
But a player’s career can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I still deal with you when it comes to stress and stress at work, but management just feels right.
I’ve always wanted to run and now I’m doing it, and I’ve never felt more comfortable with myself as an adult.”

The perfect time for a pint beer is at 17:30 on Saturday, found in the survey
The summer heat wave has boosted the profits of British pubs struggling for their existence, but has put pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups of pubs and bars enjoyed an increase in sales of 2.7 percent in July – but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent, the data revealed.
Peter Martin, the CGA business advisory firm that compiled the data, said: “The significance of England’s continued bright weather and longer-than-expected participation in the World Championship is that July had a pattern similar to that of June, with pub revenues rising 2.8 percent, but restaurants suffered an even more severe blow.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant trade seen in June only worsened in July.
Beverage-focused bars and pubs have recorded the strongest performance, with higher revenue growth in the restaurant business than in the previous period.
Food-focused pubs also suffered from the sun, although their situation was less dramatic than that of restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pub and bar chains, the percentage of beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent over the month, and the percentage of food sales decreased by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s data analyst for leisure and hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important sporting or social events are the most important factors when it comes to the outdoor entertainment market.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to last year would be especially painful in addition to all of the regular half-costs.
The long, hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse moment for food-focused businesses, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring about a respite from what they so desperately need.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand launches.
The UK pub, bar and restaurant industry regulator, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 groups, with a combined business turnover exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the benchmark for the sector’s performance comparison.
One in five children have social media accounts they hide from their parents.
A survey revealed that one in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students said they had a “primary” account that they show their parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – creates social media accounts that they keep a secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts — a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they run a clean “main” account to show their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother who came across the secret account of her 13-year-old teenage daughter found that she was asking others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the School Administrators Association (HMC) of independent schools in the UK found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles and half of them admit to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers won’t be able to find them.
Eileed Doyle will serve as the "Athletes' Voice" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eylid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as External Director at the Annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most decorated light athlete, and Chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who are leading the sport to benefit from her rich international experience over the past decade.
“Ilid has been highly respected by the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are confident that Scottish athletes will be of tremendous benefit from bringing it to the board,” said Beatty.
Doyle said: “I’m passionate about being the voice of athletes and I hope I can contribute and really help guide sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and four Olympic gold medals in total, and is now a regular contributor to the BBC, has lost his ability to walk after suffering a stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time will tell if I'll recover or to what extent.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, re-learned how to walk and today performs agility and reaction speed exercises!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!”
Advertisement for milk pumps comparing mothers to cows Opinion Party Online
A dairy company split opinions online with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cow milk.
To mark the launch of the pump, which is set to be the world’s first “quiet, wearable milk pump,” private user technology company Elvie has released a humorous video ad to demonstrate the freedom of action the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn full of hay to the sound of a song that included words like, “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see a tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed it’s not udders, it’s my breasts.”
The chorus of the song goes on to say, “I suck, I suck, I feed the babies, I suck, I suck, I milk my girls.”
But the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of responses, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many said it sheds light on the dairy industry’s “horrors.”
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>A very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they also have to get pregnant and have to give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them within a few days after the litter.”
Elvie’s milk pump discreetly blends into a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another response said: “Traumatized in a way that is understandable for both cow and calf.
But hey, why not use them to advertise a milk pump to mothers who get to keep their babies?”
Another said: “A completely disconnected advertisement.”
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was "laughing."
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
It made me feel like a cow.
The commercial was a bit crazy, but I was referring to its content.
“It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
It’s a funny ad for mothers who suck (often in their workplaces or in the bathroom) and feel like “cows.”
It’s not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women's group discovers that they all danced with the discreet pumps inside their bras.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women, who use a pump of milk, say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, without pipes and wires, it discreetly blends into the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while pumping.
Anna Blarin, a partner and director of the Early Childhood Development Department at Mother, noted: “Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it has received a bold and provocative launch.
In making a comparison between self-expressing women and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milk pump and all the challenges it has in the spotlight, and to demonstrate in an entertaining, recognizable way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will provide.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the runway for designer Martha Jacobowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been quietly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children in custody has surged even though the number of monthly border crossings remains relatively unchanged, partly because the Trump administration’s policy and discourse have made it difficult to transfer the children to sponsors.
Typically, most sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and feared that their ability to stay in the country by applying for child responsibility would be jeopardized.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members would need to hand over fingerprints, and that those data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albanese, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for unsupervised child custody.
The authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of the sponsors or their family members are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminals from foreign countries.
That’s why we continue to pursue these people,” Mr. Albanese said.
In order to address solutions for children more quickly, officials introduced new laws that would require some of them to appear before a court within a month of their arrest, instead of 60 days after the previous regulations, shelter workers reported.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than face-to-face, to present their arguments for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for release will be deported quickly.
The longer these children remain in foster care, the more likely they are to develop anxiety and depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, shelter workers and reports from the system said in recent months.
Consultants say these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs of the child’s difficulties are likely to be neglected, due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent city without providing enough time to emotionally prepare them or break up with friends could worsen the trauma that many already face.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
In an appeal to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext that they were fighting terrorism and would be “treated accordingly.”
“They should withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the rally.
Moalem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until we clear the Syrian lands" from the terrorist organizations and "any illegal foreign presence whatsoever."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish and Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 fighters on its war-torn soil.
On the refugee issue, Moalem said the conditions for their return were good and accused “certain Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that drove refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to assist in their return,” he said.
They are politicizing an issue that should only be humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned against sending aid to rebuild Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity for progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which has a population of three million people.
However, Moallem stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that the military action would focus on jihad fighters, including fighters from the victory front linked to al-Qaeda, who would be “destroyed.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee, composed of members of the government and opposition, to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moalem set conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, said the panel’s work should be limited to “examining the provisions of the current constitution,” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers hope, impeachment and scandal will end his presidency prematurely.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale in the history of the presidency of all time"!
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, peak-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million CNN viewers and nearly tripled to 1.6 million MSNBC viewers.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers at peak hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show,” which reached the top of cable ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers at major news evenings.
“It’s the fire that people are drawn to because it’s not something we understand,” said Neil Barr, executive producer of the ABC drama series The Designated Survivor, which deals with a secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the capital.
Nell Scoble, an old comedy writer and author, “Only the Funny Parts: ... And Some Hard Truths About Infiltrating Into the Hollywood Men’s Circle,” has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
She asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Ms. Scoble told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike all other TV shows, the storylines coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Rue v. Wade verdict, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite and the health of the global economy.
Replacing a channel or ignoring it is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you go beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself watching for six hours a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s use of the covert informant as a source for Fear, Paul Manafort’s 15,000-dollar leather Bombardier Jacket and the implications of the The Washington Post’s Theorem.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he’s doing, which feels similar to a reality show, is feeding you something every night,” said Brett Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show “History for Sale,” about the team changing at Trump’s show and the daily twists in the plot (the war with the NFL, the praise for Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to lose one chapter or be left behind.
When I got to Mr. Place this week, it was bright outside with a temperature of about 26 degrees on the north coast of Kauai Island, but he shut down to watch MSNBC, and recorded CNN at the same time.
He was unable to disengage, not when Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.
“I remember the times when we did all these crazy shows in the past and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Place told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Funds from outside sources flood the race for the tightest mid-term elections in Congress
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th district faces a flood of funds, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts, which led to a race of two members of Congress for the same seat.
The newly redrawn suburb of Pittsburgh put Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who won his seat in another district, in a special election last spring.
Lamb ran against another congressman, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who now represents Pennsylvania’s 12th District, which largely overlaps with the boundaries of the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the division of former districts had discriminated against, and contrary to the Constitution, the results in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a battle of financial blows in the campaign between the financial weapons of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March special election, which was widely watched, for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The seat belonged to the Republicans for more than a decade, and President Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators expected a slight advantage for Democrats.
The U.S. has considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China and has since withdrawn.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a heated meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump management team.
State Department officials decided to return the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in response to “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which was estimated to have received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in economic aid and targeted restrictions on visas, could have hurt a Central American country suffering from high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials rejected an urgent conference that was supposed to focus on safety and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar conference last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials made clear their desire to promote the conference, ending all punitive measures against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now due to address the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, as a symbol of the importance the administration attributes to him, diplomats said.
And three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman on Bolton's behalf declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal discussions, provided they remained anonymous.
Their explanations were confirmed by an outside analyst, close to the government, who also spoke anonymously.
Studying History
The obvious next step may come from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the alleged obstruction of Trump’s investigation, for which there is now substantial evidence in public records.
Mueller is reportedly referring his investigation to the question of whether the Trump campaign cooperated with Russia in its attacks on our election campaign.
If control of Congress changes, Trump will find himself accountable to this body, just as he prepares to stand before voters again, and perhaps even a jury.
There are a lot of questions here that start with "if" and I don't mean to claim that the fall of Trump is inevitable - not even the equivalent of him in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all need to make choices that will affect how long the fight can last.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler if only the West opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to prevent the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the march of democracy is unstoppable, accelerated, or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What would we do if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspaper reported last year that he had offered to secretly record the president and had speculated about his lack of suitability for the presidency.
Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
How will we respond if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections and appoint a congress that will put Trump in charge?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter’s slumber.
But I believe we won't fail, because of the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, which also occupied the magnificent house I once had.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light Shabbat candles on the same table with the swastika.
With such a legacy, how could I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Durance of the Rangers Optimistic Towards the Rapid Vienna Confrontation
The Rangers are hosting the Vienna Rapid on Thursday and know that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in the European League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Durrance from appearing for the first time in the season until a 2-2 draw with Viareal, but he believes the Rangers could use this result as a springboard for better performance.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
We went out into the game believing we could get something and we got a point.
We might have won in the end, but overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were out of the freeze in the second half and we were the better team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
“I hope we can get three points but it will be a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but with the audience behind us, I’m sure we can push and get a positive result.
The last year has been really tough, with everything that has happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but there’s a good feeling about the place now.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed.
Women stay awake because of this fear about retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, only a few people talk about it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they talk to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to have the conversation,” said Holly Schneider, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
You can do it the following way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for the treatment if you don’t express your wishes well in advance.
Help your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get treatment, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining cost.
Share with your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you find a way to pay for your expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a sum of money to help cover expenses, or self-insurance with your capital — as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: find an early solution to legal disputes on this occasion.
Find and hire a health authority, a trusted person who will supervise your medical care and make sure that your health care professionals do what you want in case you can’t communicate.
Also consider signing a power of attorney when it comes to your finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions in your place and ensure payment of bills if you are not qualified.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine your adult parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications or allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be ready.
“The financial side is not the only important point, but who are the doctors?” Martin asked.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare the plan.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo, official sources said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The disaster cut off communications networks and officials responsible for the aid were unable to obtain information from Dongala County, an area in northern Palo, which was closer to the 7.5 noise source itself.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster hit.
Here are some facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017, according to estimates.
The city marked its 40th anniversary when the tsunami and earthquake hit.
Dongala is a county that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the province, an administrative region within the province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
The main sources of income in the province’s economy are fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Another important source of income is nickel mining, concentrated mainly in Murwali, on the coast on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit West Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, known for its seismic activity and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra, on December 26, caused a 14-nation tsunami that killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, and more than half of those killed were found dead in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the provincial capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mantawai Islands in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Fidi Jaya Bacha district, causing destruction and panic, as the locals remembered the devastation after the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami.
The earthquake did not cause a tsunami in this case, but more than 100 people were killed from collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence
Trak Palin, the eldest son of Sara Palin, the governor of Alaska and a candidate for the post of former Vice President of the United States, was arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Vasile, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, disrupting reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when a miner tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in detention at the Matt-soo private facility under a $500 self-guarantee, according to a report by KTUU television channel.
According to the network’s reports, he appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself “not guilty, for sure,” when asked to flatten his claims.
Palin has been charged with three types of A offenses, and may, therefore, be jailed for a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with type B conduct, which carries a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, disrupting reporting of a domestic violence crime, and possession of a weapon under duress in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami wave and earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks have been cut off and the rate of losses is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos, distributed on social media, show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate a beach festival in the city of Palo when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saipolo Saipov, a suspected terrorist in New York City who killed eight people, a rare punishment not carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out a bike-track attack on the side of the West Side highway in southern Manhattan, and ran over pedestrians and cyclists who stumbled on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily injuries, according to the Death Penalty Intention Statement filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty can be demanded on these two counts.
Weeks after the attack, federal jurors slapped Saipov with a 22-point indictment, including eight counts of racketeering-assisted murder, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning in advance and deliberately,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saifov carried out the attack as “low, cruel and sick.”
“Saifulo Habibulevich Saikov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Claves, Ann-Lor Deckd, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlig, Hernan Frucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damien Pinyoko,” the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the Southern District of New York sued for capital punishment was a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were both executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saifov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not express remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about his actions, police said.
Saifov told authorities he was inspired by the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to police, he also asked to hang an ISIS flag in the hospital room where he was staying.
He claimed he was innocent in response to the 22-point indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal defense attorneys representing Saifov, said they were "of course disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
“We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of receiving a guilty plea that would lead to a life sentence without possibility of release, would only delay the duration of the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be appointed in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to “recruit the People’s Army” today during a protest at the Conservative Conference.
The former leader of the UKIP party said politicians must "feel pressure" from the Eurasians - when a member of parliament from Theresa May's Conservative Party argued that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Boone said at a march in Birmingham that Britain was “already out” at this point if Prague were to serve as Brexit Secretary.
But May’s challenge, reconciling the deeply divided ranks of the Conservatives, was underscored by the inclusion of conservatives who support staying in the EU for a different demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her compromise plan, the cheskers, on track despite attacks from Brexiteers, Brexiteers and the EU.
The allies insisted that they would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backlash – and force the Eurasianists and Labour to choose between their agreement and “chaos.”
Boone said at a meeting of the Leave Means Leave group in Solihull that he wanted to “break up with Chequers.”
He claimed that Prague should have been accepted as a member and be in charge of the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
Wallingborough MP added: “I will protect Brexit but we have to say goodbye to Chequers.”
He stressed his opposition to the European Union and said: “We did not fight the two world wars to be enslaved.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Boone dismissed the argument that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative MP and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also at the march and told reporters: “I say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers program is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists who took to the streets and elected us in the first place.
Please, drop the chakras and start listening.”
In a critical message aimed at May, she added: “Prime ministers keep their jobs as they keep their promises.”
Prague said at the conference that politicians should be made to “feel the pressure” if they were going to betray the resolution adopted in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them, ‘We will not let you get away with it.’
He added, in a message to an enthusiastic audience: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel pressured.
“We call on the people’s army of this country, which has given us the victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.”
At that moment, the supporters of the stay marched in Birmingham and then held a two-hour conference in the city center.
A handful of activists waved “Conservatives Against Brexit” posters after the group was formed over the weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked the opening of the Conservatives' conference over the security problems they had suffered with the party's app.
“These are people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology possible to make a deal like Canada plus plus, to cross a border without friction and to trade freely without borders in Ireland,” he added.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> It's totally ridiculous.
There is no such thing as “good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘seriously consider’ running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “seriously consider running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a town hall meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for the midterm elections in November against Republican Jeff Deal, who served as co-chair of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was at the center of rumors that she might run against Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke, which took place on Saturday afternoon, is the 36th meeting with voters in the format of a town hall meeting since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren responded, “It’s time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government and for women to take the lead.”
Arrest in the case of the shooting of Simms by LSU
Police in the Louisiana capital, Baton Rouge, announced Saturday that the suspect in the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wade Simms was arrested on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson during an 11 a.m. press conference held by ET.
Police released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
The 20-year-old Simms was shot and killed near the University of Southern campus early on Friday.
“Wade Simms suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, as reported by 247sports.
Wade tried to protect a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene with weapons and singing at Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The junior, who is nearly two metres tall, played 32 games with 10 starts in the final season and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton finishes with a world title after his teammates gave him a victory over Sebastian Wattle
It was clear, from the moment Walter Bottas made it to the next level before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, that the Mercedes team’s promotions would play an important role in the race.
From the start, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton almost alone, defending his place in the first two rounds and inviting Wattle to attack his teammate.
Wattle went to the intermission first and allowed Hamilton to fit in with the competition's tail, an apparently decisive decision.
The Mercedes team made a stop later and returned to the race behind Wettle, but Hamilton moved forward after a close wheel fight in which the Ferrari driver was forced to leave the inner track to hold off risklessly after a double move in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the ranking and was in seventh place at the end of the first round.
He then led for much of the race and did not change tires to get a quick finish and overtake Kimmy Raikkonen to fourth place.
He eventually dropped to a stop in the 44th round and was unable to pick up the pace in the remaining eight rounds when Reykonen took fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valerie's been doing a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me get around him.
The team has done extraordinary work to get to the double," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a conference on Saturday over her insistence that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
While addressing a conference in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying instead that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “bad and nasty and liars.”
“The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and bad and nasty and liars,” he said.
When you look at the ads and the leaks and they say, "Oh, I didn't do that.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... Did you leak the document-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
So, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and it was leaked earlier in September — but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s charges, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep his secret and I kept the letter as secret as she asked me to.”
But the senator’s denial did not seem to have been accepted by the president, who responded to it during the conference on Saturday evening: “I’m telling you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe it’s not [the leak], but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president went on to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, and claimed that Democrats were using the accusations for their own ends.
They are determined to return to power at all costs.
You see the evil, the mean, they don’t care who they hurt, who they run over on the road to power and power,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 vs Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee stars made amends for their loss in the elite league on Friday against the Belfast Giants and won the next game 5-3, at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an early lead on two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis in Wheeler.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cawney brought their team back to business until Dwyer brought the advantage back to the giants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard compared for the Dandites until two exiles of Lucas to Andenwald Nielsen secured the victory.
This is the third loss of the season in an elite league for Adam Kif’s team, who emerged behind to defeat the 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
This is the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants have won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaul's cooking, and David Rothford cooked the goal at Wheeler when he doubled the score four minutes later.
In the first full third, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10 until Matt Marquardt cooked up Caony's Equivalent Goal at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the giants' advantage on the first break when he scored his second goal in the evening, at the end of the first trimester.
The home team was regrouped and the rest scored again a goal that compared the game at 27:37.
Caony and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen take advantage of the Danes for the first time in the game, at the end of the second trimester, and Nielsen secured the Danes' victory with the fifth goal, which he scored from half the field in the last trimester.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes at home in the next game on Friday.
An aviation inspector has sacrificed his life to ensure hundreds of passengers can escape an earthquake.
An Indonesian aviation inspector has been crowned a hero after sacrificing his life to ensure a plane with hundreds of passengers takes off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing after a powerful earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday and caused a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palo.
But even though many of his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonyus Gnavan Agung refused to abandon his position, in a heavily vacillating control tower at the Mutiara Sis al-Jofari airport in Palo.
He stayed in place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321 could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Force spokesman Johannes Sirite said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from the airport in Alicapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper got to Palo.
“Our hearts are broken because of the news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands because, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, access to Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The death toll will continue to rise as many bodies are still buried under the rubble and access to many others is not possible,” said agency spokesman Satupou Porvoo.
Waves up to six meters high destroyed Palo and the city will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and equipment.
Risa Kosuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances bring bodies every minute.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, who heads the Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working quickly to help the survivors but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but the situation can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country’s soldiers: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Plane Crashes in Micronesia: Air New Guinea Says One Man Missing After Plane Crash in Lagoon
The airline, which operated the crash-landed flight in the Pacific lagoon of Micronesia, now says one person is missing, having previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, it had been unable to say what had become of one passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water during an attempt to land at Chowk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that the condition of all remaining passengers was stable.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The U.S. Air Force and Air Force said the plane landed in Laguna a short distance from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the course.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane had reached a very low orbit.
“It’s a very positive thing,” Janes said.
Janes said he and the others managed to make their way to the emergency exits in the water at the waist height of the sinking plane.
He said the crew was nervous and screaming, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve the dock also helped with rescue operations by using an inflatable boat that brought people to shore before the plane sank in water about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Air Safety Network (ASN) data shows that 111 people have been killed in crashes at listed airlines in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air New Guinea has not been involved in any of these incidents.
An analyst details the course of events on the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution proved its case on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the motions of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the motions of the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night she was killed.
According to the Ledger Clarion report, Rowlett said he received the location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his earlier claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went out to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was with Sanford that night, Sanford said he was “lying because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records indicate they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing speech on Sunday, according to the plan.
The judge said he expected the trial to be moved to the jury hearing later that day.
The High Breed: What is Hip-Hop Consciousness?
The hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative opinion of the genre and fill their music with positive messages.
The High Breed trilogy from Bristol claims that Hip Hop has moved away from its origins as a tool for expressing political messages and attacking social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make the conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as the Fujis and Comune have recently been revived in the UK through artists such as Akala and Oki.
Another black man?
New York nanny sues couple for dismissal after ‘racist’ text message
A New York-based therapist is suing a couple for dismissal for discrimination after receiving a text message that was not intended for her from the mother who complained that the therapist was “another black person.”
The couple denied he was racist and compared the lawsuit to "blackmail."
Lindsay Flasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she found out that her new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
According to a New York Post report, after noticing the ejaculate, Flasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, saying that the former African-American nanny had done a bad job, and that she now expected to hire a Filipino in her place.
Ms. Morris was paid for one working day and sent home with Uber.
Now, Morris is suing the couple for dismissal, seeking compensation of $350 per day for six months of work and living at the place for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them, look, don’t do things like that,” she told a Friday post, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple fought back over the allegations that they were racists, saying that the termination of Morris's employment would have been required, out of fear that they would not be able to trust her after they had hurt her.
“My wife sent me something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not racist.
We’re not racists,” her husband Joel Flasco said in a post.
But would you put your child in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was an accident?
Your little baby?
Come on.
Flasco compared the lawsuit to "blackmail" and said his wife was due to give birth only two months before the incident and was "in a very difficult situation".
Do you want to go after someone like her?
It’s not nice to do something like that,” added the investment banker.
The legal case is still in progress, but the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, killing their behavior and the arguments they used.
A new letter reveals Paddington's publishers feared readers wouldn't identify with a talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: “It’s hard to imagine yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it’s published.
“It’s very amusing to know now what we know about Paddington’s tremendous success.”
After saying that her father, who worked at the BBC as a photographer before being inspired to write the children’s book by a small toy bear, would become bloodthirsty about postponing his work, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was “bitter-sweet,” after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of Paddington’s eventual success, which she described as “a very important member of our family.”
“He was a quiet man, not an arrogant man,” she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who was achieving something: you’re proud of him even though it’s not really because of you.
I think he saw Paddington's success sort of like that.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always said it was because of Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Ned called regularly and said she was in a really bad condition, which is not expected to last." said Mrs. Eden-Lafros.
And then I got a call from Ned saying that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I needed to say goodbye.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating slowly disappeared from her system.
She died sometime before and it's over. It's all over.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing it was all happening.
I couldn’t whine or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people right now.
I really had to hold on.”
In the end, Mrs. Eden-Lafros, now in mourning for the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane alongside other passengers who were unaware of her journey.
No one knew,” she said.
My head was soft, and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had a stunning sense of identification with Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women mourn postcards hanging on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries hung postcards on a bridge in Walsh with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people could call to get support.
Ms. Davis’ son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don’t want any other parent to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Leyden, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone recognized him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up every room.”
But he stopped working before he died, because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
“Mrs. Davis said, ‘I’m constantly worried about a chain reaction.’
Mrs. Davis created the postcards, “so that people would know there was someone to turn to and talk to, even if it was a friend.
Don’t sit still – you need to talk.”
Ms. Humphries, Ms. Davis’s friend for years, lost Mark, a life partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he was depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at the bottom of the ladder on Christmas Day – when the kids opened the presents he didn’t make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said that his death was a tremendous trauma to them, but that they overcame it: “It creates a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
We all have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought, if we could really get what he wanted – a limited-time, limited-scale investigation – we might be able to bring about some sort of unification,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be “splitting apart” at the ingrained party deadlock.
Why wasn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters interested in an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance stems entirely from the timing.
The midterm elections will be held in just five weeks, on Nov. 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans do not succeed, they will be greatly weakened in their attempts to bring the election of the man they want to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pence to break equality and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors in North Korea 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byung-sig, citing data from South Korea’s Union Office, said the number of defections last year was 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the main causes were stricter border controls between North Korea and China and a rise in the amount of people fleeing.
Pyongyang did not make a public statement.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them are fleeing through China, with which North Korea has the longest border and which is easier to cross than the well-guarded military zone (DMZ) between the two countries.
China treats deserters as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
North-South relations — which are technically still at war — have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier in the day, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on nuclear disarmament.
The meeting took place after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where the two generally agreed to work toward an era when the Korean peninsula would not possess nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. sanctions of lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm our weapons first,” Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee “hysterical” and said his character did not allow him to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi responded in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn’t help but think that if a woman ever showed up like that, they would say “hysterical,” Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh vehemently rejected allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes he almost screamed and choked when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee and called the arguments against him a “coordinated character murder and grotesque” organized by liberal anger over Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed prejudice against the Democrats.
“I think he has disqualified himself with these statements and the way he has pursued the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say it like this — if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he’s currently serving,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge on the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she has concerns about Kavanaugh’s possible rulings against Obama’s health reform or the Rue v. Wade verdict, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh dodged questions about the possibility of overturning certain Supreme Court decisions.
“There’s no reason for a hysterical and bribed person to go to court and expect to be told, ‘Isn’t that great,’” Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
This is a harsh criticism, and months and years of rage exceed it, and it cannot express them without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, do I?"
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager somewhere else, who said she cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique and every time she got angry and started crying, she used to say to the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are given as an outlet for rage, in part because they are inherently incomprehensible.
One of my most significant memories of an early job in my life, in an office with a male majority, was that I once found myself crying in inexpressible rage, and an older woman grabbed my back, it was a cool manager from whom I was always a little scared — and dragged me to the stairwell.
“Don’t let them see you ever cry,” she told me.
They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they’ve been able to put you down.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Colorado congresswoman, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an out-of-wedlock affair on a ship called Monkey Business and emerged from the race, Schroeder, who was deeply frustrated, realized there was no reason for her not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a decision I thought about,” she told me 30 years later and laughed.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another contender.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since she joined the campaign late, she fell behind in fundraising, so she vowed not to join the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"They think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced that she would not start an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters instead of representatives, and anger at sexual discrimination – she was choked with tears.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled the way the press reacted to her.
“You’d think I’d been sponsored by Klinx.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my tombstone?

How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The opening barrages of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a rift between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the opening shot earlier this year when he imposed a tax on important Chinese export products including solar, steel and aluminum collectors.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 million) worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all U.S. imports from China.
Beijing responded with the same currency each time, and recently increased tariffs by five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has vowed to strike back at any blow by the United States, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will surrender in the near future.
A request from Washington to retract means surrendering to its demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing manages to do the right thing, the pressure from the trade war with the United States could positively support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of an economic spin in either country is actually much more dangerous than India has ever anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, a research partner focused on Asia, in a statement.
Syria ‘ready’ to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and calls for aid to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the war on terror,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to bring the situation back to normal.
All conditions now exist for the refugees to voluntarily return to the country they left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at harming their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that the regime would not receive conditional aid or aid from countries that had financed the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated the U.S. national team with a final score of 16.5 – 10.5 on the Le Golf National track outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has so far lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again when Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn’s team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Michaelson, who has struggled for almost the entire tournament, sent his batting teammate T into the water in the 16th hole of Far-3, losing the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have reached the 5-0-0 level since the start of the tournament in the current structure, in 1979.
American actor Jordan Speith was defeated 5th and 4th by the lowest-ranked player in the European national team, Thorbjorn Olsen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world’s No. 1 player, has lost 2nd and 1st to Ian Poulter from England, which may be the last time he will play in the Ryder Cup.
With a tenure of eight Ryder Cup entries, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the European player with the highest number of wins in tournaments with 25.5 career points.
I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a rough year.
So I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the trophy back.
It’s a team, and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said nervously after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his countryman John Ram who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in the singles game on Sunday.
“The enormous pride I feel in defeating Tiger Woods, which I watched as I grew up,” Ram, 23, said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now stands at 13-21-3, a career-high Ryder Cup.
These are strange statistics from one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, before which there is only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. national team struggled all weekend to find its way on the lawns, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Pineau who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furick spoke after his team’s disappointing performance, “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Well done to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Professional Golf Association and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You need to take off your hat.
We've been defeated."
