The traffic flow is a two-point study of traffic traffic and traffic operations and their interaction with each other.
It is difficult to study traffic flow, since it is not possible to predict the character of a driver as unsavory, as if it were not done.
As a matter of course, drivers show behavior in a well-frozen area, so traffic flows have a certain degree of consistency, and can be measured by mathematics.
To better represent traffic flow, links are established between the three main characteristics, (1) flow, (2) stress and (3) speed.
