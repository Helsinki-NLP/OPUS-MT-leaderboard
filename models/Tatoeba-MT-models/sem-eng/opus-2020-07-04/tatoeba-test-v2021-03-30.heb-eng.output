I don't like to see animal abuse.
Tom left the estate before Mary's funeral.
One of the big mysterys of life is how a cat decides what's next.
I ate the venom we cooked a few days ago.
I've got a lot to do today.
Tom jumped into frozen water.
Are you sure there's no way?
Tom said he couldn't walk.
I'll wait downstairs.
Of course she's sick.
The boat's turned upside down.
Maybe we should go and see Tom.
Now you're gonna make trouble.
No one was still awake.
I'll remember you for good.
Tom was shocked.
I'll do as you advise.
Tom bet on the wrong horse.
Please explain the rejection.
Thank you for noticing.
We waited hours for you until you showed up.
Tom wasn't the only one that stood so early this morning.
The road is too narrow for traffic.
We're in trouble.
How many students are in school?
The feeling is that's the right thing.
Tom knows Mary's hiding something.
They all deserve to die.
I barely knew him.
Many animals that have lived for thousands of years no longer exist.
Let's talk about it.
Did you guys have a nice weekend?
Am I stupid?
She was depressed because of all her problems.
Are meals included at the price?
Because the rain stopped. He went on a trip.
The doctor knew how to deal with such an emergency.
The temperature went down ten degrees.
I know this neighborhood.
She made a request to Lisa.
I thought it was all over.
It's dangerous to swim at night.
It's just like fighting wind security.
I don't care about the risk.
It's weather forecast time.
It looks tough.
That man's dangerous.
She cooked us a wonderful meal.
He was a soldier during the war.
I'm on the seashore.
It would've gone my first thought.
We don't blame you.
We can't live sleepless as we can't live without food.
Someone just called.
They knew better days.
He lives right here.
If you don't hurry, you'll never get to the village.
We think the reason for his success was hard work.
I'm sick of it.
It's all up to your decision.
You're thin.
He's got thoughts, his hand supports his mind.
There's not much to say.
Look, here he comes.
She was really cold.
It's on my schedule.
Be careful not to fall to scratch the knee.
I gave it to my mom.
Stop wasting time.
I felt pretty bad.
My hobby is reading.
I'll have my coffee after dinner.
I don't forgive you.
They don't believe you.
It wasn't supposed to happen.
I don't want to study tonight.
Tom thinks Mary has made a gross mistake.
I always knew you were meant to grow up.
It's raining quietly.
Can you send this letter in a quick mail?
Close it.
Tom's not in charge.
Hey, guys, I'm Tom, and I'm here with Mary.
You guys look beautiful tonight.
We had one problem with the trick yesterday.
Tom visited Mary on October 20th.
When I got home, I found your letter waiting for me.
They're Russians.
It's more simple than it looks.
She looks like a serious and reliable person to me.
Tom Atalty.
He tried.
We can't survive without your help.
I was the one who offered it.
This novel isn't as good as his last novel.
They stayed that way for a while.
This path is dangerous.
Can you show me the way to the library?
I've been staying home all day and I've read books.
That's my decision.
It's okay.
I made him go.
Ask him to come watch the movie.
Tom was done.
Don't let me know. You know, I want to know.
I know exactly how you feel.
I met Tom in January.
They made a joint decision about the divorce.
Stop bothering me.
Today I'm in the mood of me.
Doesn't happen much.
We're planning on visiting Mr. Smith's tomorrow.
He has a comfortable nature.
I never want to leave this place.
My son is my biggest headache.
Please sit down!
I can't drive the car.
She invited all of us to ice cream.
She played in the play.
Tom told me he hasn't seen Mary all day.
I don't like being alone on the beach.
I never plan anything.
You got a map?
Tom was sweaty.
Do I have to sell it?
They communicate by hand marks.
Maybe we should ask someone for help.
I'm hungry.
That's hard to read.
I've been fed for a week and I haven't dreamed yet.
We started walking right away after she recovered.
Is there on the shelf in Japanese English?
The gun's off.
We're too few now.
We have to stay alert.
What's Tom's problem at all?
They were born with a child.
Tom seems upset.
Maybe Tom's telling the truth.
The civilization is now a threat of nuclear war.
I often have nightmares.
The company decided to hire two new secretaries.
Please give me a pillow.
Tom almost killed both of them.
I wanted to watch this movie with you.
Come on at least six.
I'm off your clues.
Very intuitive.
I'll get it back right away.
Tom and Mary are miserable, too.
What group is your boyfriend included?
Just Tom, we'll stay.
Sit down quietly, please.
Tom decided to stay behind.
Please shut up.
Do you like what you see?
Give me a second chance.
It's natural.
Never write the words "Marc Lepa" and "Marc as Rob" in German!
It's a violent neighborhood.
You'll be surprised what you can learn in a week.
There are animals that can sense a near storm.
How can I ever forgive Tom?
This house looks abandoned.
This is the perfect place for Marv.
Consult the doctor.
I'm jealous.
These are my friends.
She's in love with that kid.
Tom didn't finish all his homework.
How do you know about Tom?
You sound childish.
I know you'd do the same to me.
In the fall, years have gone up their colors and roots.
Tom never admit it by mistake, because he thinks it's a sign of weakness.
That's how I like it.
She admitted she didn't meet Maria.
It's the second river in Japan.
No one's happy.
I finally don't owe anyone.
Tom spoke rudely.
He's married and father to two.
There could have been a failure in the answer.
He's blowing his bike every week.
Don't turn off the computer.
From this distance, you can't see it anymore.
She was instructed by her previous doctor and transferred to another hospital.
I was hopeless.
My best friend speaks Irish.
It's more complicated than I thought at first.
I don't know anything about him.
I just had a few beers.
The man who ran the car is Mr. Jones.
I have to make it to my friend.
I stayed calm.
She likes to try new things.
I heard him suffocating.
Go to the next page.
Have you become an angel?
I hope this can happen now.
Materials will be stored.
Did I touch an exposed nerve?
There's a lot of fun places in big cities.
The first strike is half the battle.
I'm not sure about that, though.
I really saw a ghost.
Did you recover from the shock?
Tell Tom I'm going for a ride.
Everything's on its head.
Do you happen to know where she lives?
Tom and Mary are probably getting married one day.
Their house was set on fire.
I like that picture.
Take a nap.
Eventually, his dream came true.
I worked really hard.
Not that he's dead.
She didn't raise her hand to answer the question.
The oranges are rich in vitamin C.
I'm sure Tom told you I'd be here.
This system benefits and lacks benefits.
He hid the fact that he expelled his wife.
Shut your big mouth.
Tom told Marie about his new car.
Who invented the dynamite?
You're the great love of my life.
A fruity experience.
Where's your money?
Tom asked Mary to sing stronger.
Sorry, I can't stay long.
I don't know if it's a top.
Where's the toothpaste?
Let's get something cold to drink.
These are my books.
I want a guitar like John's.
It won't bother us if you take a photo from the outside.
Target serves the means.
You seem to have a lot of knowledge about it.
Are you a supporter or an opposer?
Please don't interfere with that.
Long Time, no C.
Today I won't get e-mail from anyone.
I've been waiting for you.
The cat just slammed his back.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Tom's from Boston.
You want to know how I did it?
I can't find the paper.
I'm learning one language.
This microscope increases itself by 100.
He goes into debt.
Tom's an ax.
Tom's not the one who left the party early.
Speaking in English?
That's really impressive!
We wanted dessert.
Tom didn't get up early enough.
Hello, how can I help you?
Tom set his gun at the target.
I believe my boyfriend's giving me horns.
You'd better leave.
Donald Trump suffers from dementia.
Please don't ask.
I'm coming to kill you.
I like the time between the Arabs.
You have to go.
Are you ready to go out?
I know what that must sound like.
Can anyone help me out here?
Where was Tom thrown to the prison house?
I learned from the best.
Don't rush to protect me.
I only know that.
Don't ignore me again.
Building space: have to use shield helmets.
It's Tom's locker.
I'm sure I won't recommend Tom for a job.
You should try not to forget what time it is.
Will you go to the U.S. next year?
Think about your future.
As far as I'm concerned, I don't trust him at all.
I don't know what to say.
It rained yesterday.
She got caught with her pants downstairs.
I know you might think I'm too young.
I can't help him.
It didn't go that far.
How's everybody feeling?
We're supposed to be safe here.
Have you had breakfast today?
There's a bridge three miles up the river.
Tom offered Mary not to do this.
I know you think there's no hope.
The judges have made a decision.
Is it hard to learn Greek?
He's going to the library to read books.
They're animals in this town.
The sky will clear soon.
I didn't like Tom.
We're trying to study here.
Please, adopt this dog cub.
It's impossible to deliver it.
Get back to your chair.
She chose a hat to fit her new dress.
I spent the last Sunday at home.
Let's not do anything to upset Tom.
I'm missing money.
I'll be done reading this novel soon.
Tom doesn't seem interested in what's going on.
I don't want you to see my daughter anymore.
You guys don't go out there.
Tom drinks three liters of water a day.
We never agree.
We were glad we were alive.
Some newspapers misled the news.
Please sign it.
That's my car.
I'd love to see that.
That pen is the best.
It's a dangerous thing to admire heroes.
Tom says he doesn't want to argue about this anymore.
White paper.
Drinks are half the price to six.
The sky is almost clear every day.
Well, I lied.
Whatever you do, don't come up with complaints about it.

Salt, please.
Have you decided where to eat lunch?
I changed my theory.
She was kind enough to pick me up from home.
I ran.
Tom's an accountant.
Pick up the left hand.
I doubt his statement.
I think they've encountered some kind of problem.
This movie is boring.
Where to go and what to see were my main concerns.
My longest romantic relationship lasted four months.
She never told me yet.
An old cat hat he always wears in the rain.
Take your stuff and go.
You just like doing bad to people, don't you?
We need a lot of people there.
You can agree or not, but I don't change the price.

You're white like a ghost.
You know what Tom wants to buy?
I can build a house for you.
Why didn't Tom want to come?
That's where she stayed until Soviet soldiers released her.

You're not like you used to be.
Nobody said that life is fair.
Please loan me $30.
I hope that's not a problem.
