In the wilderness, it is difficult for the mains of the night to have a human-entrepreneur. They meet their needs for amino acids from available plant resources.
The failure of the Halchi work has been with grave consequences: growth, malnutrition and death.
The abundance of plant resources would have made it easy for them to get access to proteins, which would have access to leaves and bacteria, and it would have been difficult for humans to remove them if they were cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (coal, white and white ants) have been mixed with Hin Hex, giving high amounts of protein to supply all essential amino acids.
As everything is done, we need to be surprised if our ancestors solve the “first protein problem” in the same way that the Champanzei has worked in the vana today.
