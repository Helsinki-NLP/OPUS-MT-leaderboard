Time is something around us that affects everything we do, and yet it's hard to understand.
Time has been investigated by religious, philosophical, and scientific teachers for thousands of years.
We experience the time as a series of events from the future through the present to the past.

Communicating patterns are techniques to solve problems that combine ideas or different fields to find a solution.
The focus of this thinking pattern is speed, logik and precision, as well as fact recognition, re-application of existing techniques, data collection.
The most important cause of this pattern of thinking is: there is only one correct answer, and think of only two answers, and they are true or incorrect.
This kind of thinking has to do with certain sciences or standard processes.
People with this kind of thinking have a logical thinking, and they can memorize patterns, solve problems and work on scientific tests.
Humans are the most talented of all by reading the thoughts of others.

MRI scan is based on a physics phenomenon called a nuclear magnetic confession (NMR), which was discovered in the 30s by Felix Blackclake (when he worked at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
In this confession, magnetic field and radio waves cause orphans to collect tiny radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Demadian, a doctor and a scientific researcher, discovered the basis for using magnetic recognition as a medical diagnosis.
Four years later, a patent was given, which was the first patent ever published in the field of MRI.
"In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first "all-body" MRI scan, which he called "the Unsuccessful."
