AMs from Wales fear that "will be seen as a booh"
There is co-ordination among some AMs after a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of Parliament of Wales).
This was raised by plans to change the name of the Wales Parliament assembly.
The AMs around the political spectrum are concerned that this will make them seem restrictive .
AM Labourist said that his group was concerned that "this has the same sound as Twp and Pwp."
For readers from outside Wales: In the language of Wales twp means ibleh and pwp means rwt.
AAM of Plaid said that the whole group was “not pleased and suggested alternatives.
Conservative by Wales said that his group had "open mind" about changing the name, but noted that there was a small verbal difference from MWP to "Muppet".
In this context the letter w in the Wales language will be combined in a similar way to the letter punctuation and.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce changes to the name, said: "The final decision on any description of what should be called Members of the Assembly will of course be the issue of the members themselves."
The 2017 Wales Government act empowered the Wales assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that had broad support for the assembly to be called a Wales Parliament.
On the issue of the title of AMs, the Commission favoured Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but MWP received most support in a public consultation.
AAMs are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching a consensus can be a headache for the Chief Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes in the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualified AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on the issue of how they should be called when they have a debate on legislation.
In Macedonia they leave public opinion in a referendum on country name changes
Vontants will vote Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was established with a view to finding a solution to a dispute that lasted several decades with Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern trees represents .
The President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, an opposer of the party on the change in name, said that he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Morgan Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the consequence of entry into the EU and NATO.
St.Martin's Knee St. Martin's Ends Playing as Churchs in Harlem are sending
"historically, the elderly I spoke with say that there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr Adams.
"Today, there is no."
He said that he could understand how the bars had disappeared.
He said, "People socialize differently" today.
"The bars are no longer the centre of local activity where people go on a regular basis."
As far as churches are concerned, he is concerned that money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders are thinking, "and today or tomorrow they will come to an end where they were at the beginning."
He added that the churches can be replaced by condominous apartment blocks with the type of people who will not help the rest of the local sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who buy condoms in this building are a white trailer," he said, "and thus, they will not decide when it comes to the day they open for these churches because most of these people who enter these conscripts will not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by congregations of people of white carnoon before Harlem became metropolitans of white carpon people - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St.Martin's ten years later.
The original Metodist Congress of white carpentry people left in the 30 years.
A association of people of black carpentry who was practicing religion in close proximity took the title for the building.
St. Martin's was taken from a congregation of people of black carpentry under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boque of retailers in 125 Street, a main street for buying in Harlem, who registered the rent to or promoted the people of black carpentry.
In 1939 he left the building with severe damage, but as Father Johnson parishes made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carlone.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson's and successor of St. Martin's, was proud when he called the Carlon "the nephew of the people."
The expert who joined the carillon in July called him another excuse: "A cultural treasure" and "a unique historical instrument."
The expert, Tifanany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that she was the first carlone in the world to have had a black trailer musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who walked for the largest carilone in the Church of Reverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not change with anyone else.
What happened in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story of experts and contractors, some admitted by the leaders of the lay church, others from the Epposial Diocese.
The 'vestry' - the governing body of the parish, composed of lyric leaders - wrote the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "will seek to pass the costs" to thevestry, although thevestry was not involved in linking the experts and contractors who sent it from the diocesis.
Some parishors complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocesis.
The shark hurts a 13-year-old boy while waiting for a bus driver in California
The seaman attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was working for the bus driver in California on the day of the opening of the bus season, said the officials.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. where Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was working with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shout for help and then went to heal him with a group to help draw out of the water.
Hammel said that for the first time he thought that it was the aftereffect to catch a wharf, but then "realize that he was shouting, 'Gidim me!
Goim me!'
Filled him and opened the entire school," Hammel said that he realized the moment that came where the child.
'Havish to get everyone out of the water: 'There's a sea dog in the water!' added Hammel.
Take the child through a helicopter to Ray Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
The Liveward Capt. Larry Giles said in a meeting with the media that the shark was fed into the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a species of a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Baach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
The United Kingdom's plans enter into the United Kingdom's beauty market
Sainsbory's is competing against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with corridors of scarves similar to those of a ‘department score’ of beauty products equipped with specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial market income of €2.8 billion in the UK's beauty, which continues to grow while the sale of clothing and articles for domestic use decreases, the larger corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 shops across the country and the idea will spread in more stores next year if it is successful.
The investment in beauty came after the supermarkets were looking for ways to use the space on the edges once used for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbory's said that he will double the amount of beauty items he is offering up to 3000 items, including firms such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Fields of existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have more space with firm areas similar to those located in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket will also re-launch the range of its Botique makeup so that the majority of products are fit for the hurricanes - something that is increasingly called for by smaller buyers.
In addition, the retailer of Fragrance Shop will examine concessions in two stores of Sainsbury's, which first opened in Croydon, London below, last week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards shopping with small amounts of food per day in local convenience shops means that supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to buy from there.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that shops will increasingly look like a ‘department slaps’ as the supermarket chain tries to fight against shops that account for Aldi and Lidl prices with more services and non-food production.
Sainsbory's has been placing Argos' shops in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitats since he bought the two chains two years ago, which says that he strengthened the sale of the goods and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to renew its beauty and office departments has failed.
Sainsbory's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the link ended after a fight on how to divide the entry of pharmacist's shops into his supermarkets.
The new strategy came into effect after Sainsbury's sold the office business with 281 shops to Celesio, the owner of the Loyds Pharmacy chain, for EUR 125 million, three years ago.
It said that Lloyds will play a role in the plan, by adding an extended range of luxury skin care firms including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and sensation of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in colleagues who have been especially trained to be available to offer advice.
The range of our firms has been designed to be appropriate to any need and the attractive environment and convenient positions of shops mean that we have become a destination of the beauty products of interest which challenges the old way of buying."
Peter Jones 'very angry' after being Willoughby cancel an agreement of £11 million
The personality of Dragos Den Peter Jones's 'very angry' after TV’ presenter Schfeldby cancelled a â11 million agreement with the business of his lifestyle firm to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for the firm of household products and their accessories, Truly.
The par business was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's firm, Goop.
The presenter of The Morning, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce its departure.
How long has she left Dragos' personality" Den Peter Jones very angry because she cancelled off being part of their business of a life-style firm that earns a lot of money in the last minute – to focus on its big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was "very angry" when the personality of the very popular television admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at its entropy business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, whose new agreements – worth up to £1.5 million - meant that there was no time left to dedicate their home and accessories firm, Truly.
The business was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow Goop's firm and it was thought that it would double the estimated wealth of Willoughby in EUR 11 million.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, she appeared on an Instagram to announce that she was going to leave with Truly, Jones left the British Great and went to one of his private Travellers.
The source said: "Truly has been with many of the first priorities of...
It would have been its long-term future that would have filled it with the next few decades.
Her decision to leave left everyone completely surprised.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was almost complete.
There is a full store produced in the Marlow headquarters that are ready for sale."
The experts believe that the departure of the presenter of The Morning, located among the profit-making personalities of Great Britain, could mean a cost of millions for the company due to large investment in products from mills and candles to clothing and household products, and the potential for further delays until its launch.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three children, Willoughby and her nephew Dan Baldwin have been well friends with Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52, he joined them as Chairman-in-Chief Chairman in March.
The couples fly together and Jones has a 40 per cent share in the Baldwin television production company.
Willoughby shall become ambiblical of the M&S firm and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presenter of I'm A Celebry of ITV.
Last night, a close source of Jones said, "We don't comment about his economic affairs."
Hard meeting 'but then we found love'
He looked at criticism that will come from news media for making a comment that some people consider "non-presidency" and for being so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with a voice to imitate that of "the news presenter".
"I didn't give up anything."
It is noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump concluded that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But denuclearisation negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's best diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders, on Saturday, at the General Assembly, that North Korea did not see a "corresponding response" from the United States for the early steps of North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, note, the US continues with targeted sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view of the speech of his demonstration.
He said, "We are going well with North Korea".
"We were going to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have this very good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - the end of rocket tests, relief in the release of the hostages and the return of the remaining American veterinarians to the home.
And he defended his unusual approach while talking about relations with Kim.
"It is very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter this scene filled with people, we would have about 200 standing there," said Trump, as he points to the crowd directly before him.
Tsunami and Terremot in Indonesia Destroy Island, Killing Hundreds of People
In the consequences of Lombok's earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not required.
Even after more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had to move from home, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalysing international aid.
"Suddenly, in many cases, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it is a challenge," said M. Sombung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to travel to Palu, it is not clear whether foreign staff can operate on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, speaker of the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palau to see whether international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Taking into account the frequent earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still not well prepared for the great anger of nature.
While a refuge from the tsunamis was built in Aceh, they were rarely seen along the coast.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palau, despite having issued a warning, is likely to contribute to the loss of life.
In the best times, travel between the numerous islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital bus was posted in Lombok for the care of the victims on his way to Palu, but it will last at least three days to arrive at the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made improvements to the infrastructure falling pieces of Indonesia, the centre of his electoral campaign, and spent a lot of money on roads and trains.
But Mr Joko's administration sent because of the lack of funds as he faced his election next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from sectoral tensions that are still in Indonesia, where the members of the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative form of this faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to move from their homes as gangs Insera and Muslims fought on the road, using ‘machetes’, bows and arrows and other types of weapons.
See: Liverpool Sturgeon Daniel brings the same points in the last minute vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss in Premier League against Chelsea with a ‘goal’ in 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturgery received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri while it was 27 metres away from Chelsea's lasta with his team losing 1-0.
Reach the ball a little to its left before it separates the ball into the rod.
The ball hangs over many of the box as it ends up at the right side of the net.
Eventually, the ball came down after Kepa Arizabalaga, which went beyond trying to welcome it, and fell into the net.
"I was trying to get into that position, to get into the ball and players like Shaq always sending it as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kent coming over me and I hit the ball once and I didn't think much about it and tried to separate the ball."
Chelsea were winning 1-0 to half the game after they brought 'goal' in 25 minutes by the very good Belgian player Eden Hamard.
Chelsea’s screen distributed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before it started going toward the middle of the grandand and then entered the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly distributed the ball in the middle of the grand.
Then he shot the ball very nicely, which led to Howard inside the box.
Hazard happened more than the players in the defence and sent the ball into the net with the left foot and passed through the place of Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool fights against Napoli at the stage of the Champons League groups on the 3rd afternoon next Wednesday at Stadio San Paulo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the EUFA Europa League on the afternoon of 3 p.m. next Thursday in London.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The number of deaths in the Indonesian tsunami rose to 832, said the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people have been reported caught under the debris of the building which fell due to the 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday causing high waves up to 20 feet, said by the Sutopo Puro Nugroho agency at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 people, was filled with scrappings from the building that fell.

I would also like to call on everyone, in particular the taxi drivers, who may have caught something on the Dashcam videos to contact us by having information that is vital to our investigation.'
A police speaker confirmed that the woman who found her body was by Birkenhead and found inside property.
Today afternoon friends who think they know the woman came on the ground to ask questions about where she was found this morning.

The status of the Cromwell Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the debate on ‘histories rewritten’
Place of birth: (a) Paktika Province, Afghanistan, (b) Paktia Province, Afghanistan, (c) Paktia Province, Afghanistan.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestion as "gentle" and "try to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, the president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate on the removal of status that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The ‘iconoclasm’ of the British civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the bad Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his orphan Thomas in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of an opinion of the 19th century and part of the storography of a figure that many believe is still a celebrationist.
Mr Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telephone: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of the parliament against external pressure, of course, the monarchy.
If this is a fully accurate representation, it is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure that is recognised as representing one side of that split.
His achievements as a 'Lord Proctor' also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
Killing a Killer and Killing a Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in south-eastern China, according to local media reports.
The man, only identified with his name "Yuan," was found dead with a cut-off, blood-covered artery near the market of Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported to the South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in hoggery on 30 May 2005 in Xinging Province of Qinghai, China.
Supposedly, travel with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found his dead, and discovered a door for the pig slaughter in the open vicinity.
A blood pig was present in his mouth.
In the absence of any other information, the Commission considers that the measures in force against the Union are incompatible with the internal market and therefore cannot be considered compatible with the internal market.
"Civine legs were red and mutilated," said the cousin, who referred to him with his nickname "Wu," as quoted by the Guying Living News.
The security camera videos showed Yuan diaz on the market on 4.40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about one hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was not of Yuan or of puppies.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was forced to not attack others, while the police collected evidence on the ground.
The Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for its death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking people have been registered before.
in 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man ended up in a critical way.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg kept a farmer from Wales with his tractor until he expelled his wife.
After the pigs of a farmer from Oregon attacked and ate him in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba farmer told the CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the blood taste can act as a "cause".
"Be playing.
They lie, are very curious... do not intend to hurt you.
Only you must show them the appropriate amount of respect," he said.
The ruins of Morgan Rosa will bring widespread rain in the south-east of the United States
As foretold, the Uragan Rosa is weakening as he moves on colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring a flood around the north of Mexico and south-east of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa brought a wind of 85 mph, Category 1 Uragan, on the 5th morning at the time of Sunday East, and was located 385 miles in the south-east direction of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is forming a ‘long’ on the Pacific Ocean and is moving east to the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa is approaching the Baya California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will start pushing a strong tropical humidity in the north-east of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical humidity interacting with the approaching 'treaty' creates a strong rainy rain in the south-east in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inch of rain will cause dangerous rapid flooding, residue flows and possible floods in the desert.
In the absence of any other information, the Commission considers that the measures in question constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.
From 2 to 4 inch of rain are expected in parts of south-east, especially on most of Arizona.
Fast floods are possible under rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread character of tropical rain.
It would be no good idea to walk through the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
A heavy rain can cause the canyons to become dangerous rivers and storms will bring much local and dusty winds.
‘Trough’ will bring some rain to parts of the southern coast of California.
A total of more than half an inch of rain is possible, which can cause small flows of dust and wet roads.
This would be the first rain of their rainy season region.
Some cultures of scattered tropical rain start heading toward Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes further scattered later on Monday and Tuesday.
A heavy winter spreads in Fur Corners on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October there may be some marked changes in temperature across the US as the Arctic cools, but tropical areas remain quite hot.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There will be a major example of dramatic temperature differences from the United States Centre on Sunday.
There is almost a 20-degree difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missuri, and Omah, Nebraska, and between St Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the coming days, the summer heat that remains will try to develop and expand again.
A large part of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a hot start in October with temperatures in the 80s spread from Southern Plans to parts of the North-East.
New York City can reach up to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is approximately 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high possibilities for temperatures above the average for the East of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people saw the very interesting testimony on Thursday of the nominated candidate of Supreme Court Britt Kavanwagh and the woman who accused of committing a alleged sexual attack in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political fight continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming with the shocking news of the last minute of Friday: an agreement drawn up by the Minister of Arizona Ge Fake for the FBI to conduct a week-to-week investigation of charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that it is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh herself when he was under alcohol influence and tried to remove her clothes when they were a nurse at the post-secondary school level.
Kavanaugh, in a passing witness, said he was 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Neelsen on Friday saw it.
the company was counting the average amount of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks which showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen generally finds it difficult to calculate how many viewers from offices.
To put this in perspective, it is equal to an audience similar to that for the decisive football game or for the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose views strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the forefront of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the one-day hearing, said Nielsen.
ABC was right behind it with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Fake was the central figure in the Sunday drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, those who challenged the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning and were fighting with him as he tried to come up on the lift for a hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He remained standing there watching the lower for several minutes as he was being aggressively criticized, in a live broadcast on CNN.
"You stand here before you I," said a woman.
"Do you think you're telling the truth to a country?
They said to him, "Have the power when many women have nothing."
Falke said that his office issued a statement and said, before closing the lift doors, that it would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcasting networks were broadcasting directly, hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate in full for vote.
But Falke said that he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the designated person in the following week, that democratic minorities have been encouraging.
Falke was convinced in part of conversations with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and several years later, Falke took his decision.
The decision of Falake was empowered, as it was evident that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanwag without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister May accuses critics who are "take advantage of politics" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union that are "take advantage" of the policy and weaken national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May arrived at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former minister for foreign affairs Boris Johnson urged his attack of the so-called ‘Chequiers’ Plan for Brexit, and said that a proposal that the Great Britain and the EU should collect each other's fees was "completely safe."
The shooting on Wayde Sims: The police arrested the suspect Dayton Simpson after the death of the LSU player.
The police arrested a suspected shooting person who killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on a second-degree murder charge, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The officials issued a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the postcards and said that they found Simpson's DNA on them, reporting the CBS's affiliated WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that they admitted that he separated and killed Wade.
Its bond was set at $350,000, reporting Advocate.
The office of East Baton Rouge's Baroner issued a preliminary report on Friday, which said that the cause of death is a wound from a bullet from the head to the neck.
The department is granting credit to the police force force of the Luisian State Police, the State police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area to assist in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Joe Alleva’s athletic director thanked the enforcement of area law for "diligence and the search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The attacker who was 2 metres long, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
It averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 'rebounds' every game in the last season.
Friday morning, the basketball coach of LSU Will Wade said that the team is "lost" and "under shock" after the death of Wayde.
"This is what worries him all the time," said Wade.
Vulcan throws the ash on Mexico city
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern area of Mexico's capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crediter increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring various noises and tetonic movements.
Campaigns on social media have shown thin layers of ash that damaged car windscreens in the vicinity of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geography physicsists noted an increase in volcanic activity of 45 miles (72 km) in the south-east of capital after a earthquake of 7.1 in the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The known volcano has been active since 1994.
Police have a conflict with separations from Catalonia before the anniversary of the independence vote.
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors in favour of independence had a conflict with the anti-ravell police, and thousands joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catholic polarisation vote on the recession.
A group in favour of face-to-face separators which were held back by anti-irvell police emptyed their eggs and dust paints, and created a cloud of dark dust on the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
There were also small fighting during the day and the police had to use the bombs to control the fighting.
Over a period of several hours, groups in favour of independence were serving "Not to forget, not to apologize" to protest against unionist demonstrators who were shouting, "Spain For All."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in protests, reported the local press.
Pensions remained high in the region which wanted independence one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by Madrid but which is celebrated by separatists from Catalonia.
Voters have chosen to become independent, although participation was low with those against the recession that made a large bogus against the vote.
According to the Catalonia authorities, almost 1000 people were left behind last year after the police tried to stop voting at voting stations throughout the region in violent fighting.
Independence groups had been engaged throughout the night on Friday to prevent demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separate protest with his wife said that he had no hope in the prospects for Catalonia gaining independence.
"The last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my mother and father cry with joy that they could vote but now on our own," he said.
Despite having had a vital and firm victory in the regional elections last December, the parties in favour of the independence of Catalonia are sending to keep the momentum this year with many of their best known leaders or in their own dedication or detention and are awaiting the process due to their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Juan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was registering his phone protest in support of the police, said that the conflict was caused by both sides' policies.
"There is more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catholic leaders in prison since the end of last year, announced that he would contest in the elections of the European Parliament next year.
"By issuing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and repression seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car entered a house with strength
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car entered a home in Londonderry more than once.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday for the 19:30 BST strike.
Inspector investigating Bob Blemings said that the injury was caused to the grades and to the building itself.
Seta has also been used a ‘crossbow’ to shoot at the car at some moment.
Manga Goal wins 1-0 game for Livingston against Rangers
First 'goal' of Dolly Menga's for Livingston won the game
Livingston, which was promoted, bailed with Ringers and thus Steven Gerard lost for the second time only in 18 games as a coach of the 'cub of Ibrax'.
The shelter of Dolly Menga's ball made all the difference as Gary Holt's side was equal in points with Hibernan in second place.
The side of Gerard remained unable to win once out of her grand in the Premiership at this season and next Sunday will play against Hearts, who put first and are behind them with eight points.
Before that game, Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna in their grand in the Europa League on Thursday.
While Livingston continues to have no loss in the division in six games, with the Holt main coach that has not yet lost a game since it came instead of Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against bulk visitors
Holt's team reached him long ago who was winning before he had a ‘goal’, with the direct style of his games that was causing many problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but distributed the ball in front of the rod, then Alan Lithgow could only distribute the ball with a wide-blower band after it slid to get to receive the ball from Craig Halkett at the stage.
Those who were playing in their own grueling were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, because they knew they were the visitors could put problems to them at some moments.
And that was the way the crucial ‘goal’ arrived.
Rangers left a “free-kick” in and Livingston took the opportunity, Declan Galager and Robinson worked together to help Menga, who touched the ball and entered the latsta from the centre of the box.
Until that moment, Rangers were dominated by the possession of the ball, but they were finding the team's defence that they were playing in their own grand, non-penetraable, and the "goalkeeper" Liam Kelly had very little trouble,
That style of games continued even in the second half of the game, but Alfredo Morelos made Kelley welcome the ball.
Scott Pittman was unable to find a ‘goal’ because of the ‘goalkeeper’ of Rangers Allahn McGegor and Lithgow separated the ball widely after he had distributed another player of Livingston.
Blalene were all the time entering the Livingston box and were always removed from their players, while two requests for ‘penalty’ - after Halkit's attempt on the Glenn Middleton replacement, and another after the ball was delivered by the player's hand - were rejected.
Fenomenals from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland inside the Arena Tony Macaroni
Performance and phenomenal outcome for Livingston.
For a man, they were excellent, they continued to exceed expectations on this top-up trajectory.
The games style and their staff have not changed much since the return to the main fight, but the most credit should go to Holt to the way it has combined the team since it arrived.
He had many heroes.
The head of Halkit was very big in his games, by organising a well-organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warll with seven eyes.
However, Rangers had a lack of inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at some moments under Gerard, there was a lack of good standards at once.
The last opportunity they had with the ball was not good - only once managed to separate the team's defence that was playing in his own grandn-- and it's a sign for Ringers, who find themselves in the middle of the class.
Erdogan received different reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) there were blue cracks and sky as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – with a view to restoring the relations between NATO allies.
They did not agree on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then left to Cologne to open a huge new moskea.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The Police cited reasons for security to block a large crowd of 25,000 people from being gathered in front of the moskea, but many people supporting it appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan — many Kurdi — also mentioned their voices, condemning Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome them to the country.
Against each other's protests reflect the separation of a visitor who is a hero to certain German Turk and is thought to be ‘autoocrat’ by others.
Road companion in Peptford: Cyclicist dying in a car collision
Chicklist died in a collision that involved a car in London.
The collision took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelen Street, a road in Peptford, south-east of the city, to the collision of 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and attended the paramedics, but the man died on the ground.
This strike took place a few months after another cyclist died after he hit a car and continued going to Childs Street, about a mile away from last Saturday's collision.
The Metropolitan Police said that the officials were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and bus deviations are in place and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officials in disorder
Six prison officials were ill after a prison disorder of high-security men, said by the Prison Office.
The disorder started in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire for the 09:30 BST strike on Sunday and is ongoing.
Specialised officials "Torado" were introduced to address the disorder, involving eight prisoners and located in one of the sections.
Officials were treated for minor on-site injuries.
Prison Service speaker said: "A specially trained prison staff has been deployed to address an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of those who have committed the most dangerous crimes in the country.
In June he was reported to have received hospital care after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October the anti-investigation officers were called on in prison to address a serious disorder in which staff were attacked with ‘pool’ balls.
Uragan Rosa Threatened Phonix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake city in the Flood of Malmoon (Nestowage Areas can benefit)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week as the remaining energy of the Uragan Rosa moves south-west of the Dexert, leading to rapid flood risks.
The National Temporary Service has already established a rapid flood alert for the two and three years from Western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, California south-east and Utah, including the cities of Phonex, Flagastaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass into a straight line from Phonex on Tuesday, approaching the later Monday.
The National Time Service Putinix noted in a tweet that "only ten tropical cycles have maintained a tropical storm or depression status at a distance of 200 miles from Putenix since 1950".
Catrina (1967) was a hurricane at 40 miles from the AZ border."
The latest models of the National Centre of Uganda predict from 2 to 4 inch of rain, with amounts isolated to 6 inch in the Mgollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the South-West of the desert including the Central Rockies and the Basin Great are likely to have between 1 and 2 inches, with possible isolated totals of up to 4 inches.
For those who are at risk of rapid flooding, the rain of Rosa may be positive as the region is affected by drought.
Although the floods are a very serious issue, some of this rain is likely to be beneficial as the south-east side is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to drought monitoring devices, just over 40 per cent of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme droughts, second highest category," reported byweather.com.
First, the route of the Uragan Rosa has been moved to touch the Baya California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who will still be a very strong hurricane Sunday morning with a maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, will be located 385 miles south of Point Eugenia, Mexico and going north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting colder waters in the Pacific and therefore loses power.
Thus, it is expected to touch Mexico with the power of a tropical storm Monday afternoon or early in the evening.
The rain in parts of Mexico can be strong, creating a significant flood risk.
"A 3 to 6-inch raining lot is expected from Baya California to the northwest of Solora, with a possibility of not more than 10 inches," reported byweather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at Arizona's border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, and then will move from Arizona and south of Utah until late in the evening on Tuesday.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or its remains is a very strong rain in the Bay California, northwest of Solora, and in the desert of the south-west of the United States," they said from the National Centre of Uganda.
This rain is expected to produce life-threatening fast floods and sewage streams in the deserts, and mountain terns.
Indictment in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested after attempted murder
Three adolescents and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old child with knife wounds in Somerset.
The adolescent child was found injured in Excelsior Terrace in the Midsomer Norton area, for the 04:00 BST strike on Saturday.
Take him to a hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon, said Somerset Police.
Officials appealed to anyone who could have any video drawn from the phone of the person who had happened to speak.
Trump said that Kavanaugh 'sale the green and angry' of the Democratic Party
"Vot for Judge Kavanwagh is a vote to reject the pitiless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump during the manifestation in Weheling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanwagh 's sending green and angry' of the Democratic Party during the process of his designation.
Kavanwagh testified to the Congress on Thursday, with the strength and emotion he denied an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he attacked her sexually for decades when they were adolescents.
Ford also testified during the hearing on her allegation.
Saturday, the president said that, on that day, the "American people saw the flower and the quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"Vot confirming Judge Kavanwagh is a vote confirming one of the most modern legal minds, a lawyer with an impeccable public service record", he said to the crowd of West Virginia's supporters.
The President referred indirectly to the designation of Kavanaugh while speaking on the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't challenge, but in truth, I am challenging," he said.
"For this reason I am running everywhere fighting for very good candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats have a mission "to resist and hinder."
The first main procedural vote within the Senate on the designation of Kavanwagh is expected to take place no later than Friday, said a senior GOP assistant to CNN.
Hundreds killed by the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with the apparent increasing number of deaths
At least 384 people were killed, many were killed as huge waves came down on beaches, after a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a holiday on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six metres (18 ft) fell by force on the ground at the time it started to dark, while many were carried and died and destroyed everything that was in the middle.
The tsunami occurred after a earthquake of 7.5 power.
"When the threat of the tsunami yesterday came out, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not stand up to run and victims," said Sutopo Puro Nugroho, the speaker for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB during brewing in Jaffar.
"The tsunami did not appear alone, pulled cars, logs, houses, hit everything that was on the ground," said Nugroho, and added that the tsunami had travelled over the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before it hit the shore.
Some people went up the trees to escape from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 persons were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photos from the disaster agency showed a lot of destroyed buildings and shops, bridges that surrounded themselves and fell and a mosque surrounded by water.
Strong cracks continued to threaten the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated in the statement that the energy generated by the huge earthquake of the Week was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
They said that the geography of the city, located at the edge of a long and narrow beach, could have grown the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels had fallen.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the scrapping of fallen buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been hit and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake epicentre.
Communications "were completely sent and without information" by Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were going to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticized for not informing that a tsunami struck Palu, although officials said that the waves had arrived at the time of the alert.
In a film of social media-splittants, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard crying out anxious warnings to the tsunami approaching people on the lower road.
In a few minutes, a huge amount of water fell on the beach, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the videos immediately.
Terremot and tsunami caused a sharp burst of light that reduced communications around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The authorities said that the military started sending cargo aircraft with the aid of Japer and other cities, but evacuators still need food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city was reopened only to the aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths well exceeds 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While the staff of the World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived in the city of Palu, where the employees are being sheltered were armed tarpole shells at the edge of their office, they have passed the scene of destruction on their way there, said Mr. Doseba.
He said, "They have seen many houses that have been destroyed."
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups started the unpleasant process of disaster relief, some complained that deep-seated foreign aid workers were not allowed to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and personnel from abroad can only start if the disaster site is declared to be a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"There is a crisis of province level," said Aulia Ariani, speakers for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Since the government says, 'O.K., this is a national disaster,' we can introduce international assistance but so far there is no status."
On the second night in Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of the still missing ones were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles to echo this history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young child came out of the sewage.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who was caught under the bush for two days near her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Other than those arrested in Lukanda Roa Roa, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
"As a superior in the field of competition, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon related how, in the hours after the news that fell on the Lukanda Roa circulated amongst the paragliding community, he sent desperate, desperate, messages with Wattsapp to Palu's competitors, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, marked only that they left, but did not mark that they arrived.
"I think that what it means that the messages have not been received," he said.
Letin take $26,750 while ATM was being refilled in Newport on the Leve

Kanye West: The rap canner changes his name to Ye
The corner of the rap Kanye West is changing his name – for Ye.
While announcing the change in Twitter on Saturday, he said: "The man who was previously known as Kanye West"
West, 41, has been vaccinated for some time and used the monitor as the title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change takes place before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new Yandi album.
He replaces the Candida Ariana Grande on the program that was cancelled for "emotional reasons," said the programme creator.
In addition to being an autograph of his current professional name, West had said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'yee' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible means 'int,' said West earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with the radio presenter Big Boy.
"So I am, you, I am we, she, we.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, for Ye only - a mere reflection of what we have good, bad, what is confusing us, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
It is one of a number of famous rap songs that have changed their name.
San Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Stady, but the year announced to prefer the names Love and Brother Love.
As one who had collaborated with West, Jay-Z, also served with or without a single and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use the military against civilians
The President-elect of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use a military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Cup that he would never use the military to restrict the Mexican people."
The troops shot at a peaceful glass demonstration on 2 October 1968, killing around 300 people at a time when left student movements were being established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by granting monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
The United States shall double the funds for I.A.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this field, says the IA investor and practitioners Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after several parts of the US government made IA notices, even if there is a lack of formal IA strategy in the US.
In the meantime, China has introduced its plan last year: it aims to be the first in the innovation of the IA by 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for IA research would be a good start, as all other countries are far behind the US, and we are looking for the next revolutionary step in the IA," said Lee.
Duplication of funds can double the possibilities for the next large IA to be achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "I Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Snovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent IA companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that won the player with the highest rating of American Otä, after which he was executive with Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch in China.
Lee recognised previous US government competitions in technology such as the Highway Challenge Agency of Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when it will be next, in order to help identify the next visas.
Lee said that researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
Lee said, "It's not China that is removing academic leaders; the corporates are doing this,"
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed people who inspire others from universities to work on the IA.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to strengthen their efforts in the IA.
He said, "I believe that the green paper should be offered automatically to people who have a Doctorate in the IA".
The State Council of China issued the Next Generation Artistic Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that the China National Science Foundation provides funds to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organisations issue money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Early in the year, the US Defence Department set up a Joint Artistic Intelligence Centre, which is intended to involve industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Selected Committee for Artistic Intelligence.
And by the end of the month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in IA research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that has tried to create a National Security Commission on Artistic Intelligence has not seen any action in several months.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country;
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to "The Northern Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", a step to resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece that had blocked its offers of membership for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of the forest in its north represents a possible possession of its territory and has made aveto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but the national opponents argue that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the population of the Slovak majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and a bokit campaign raised doubts as to whether the participation would reach the minimum of 50 per cent necessary to make the referendum valid.
The question on the referendum vote reads: "You are in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Those who support the change in name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to enter into bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Scopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said that they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change in name requires a two-thirds majority in the parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that there were no irregularities reports by 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Goose Tanevski, 62, vote in capital, Scoopje.
The PM of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zuorica and his son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country giving him the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Standing before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardorkov, 54, he was picking up a small palk and preparing seats in front of the tents armed by those who are going to make a referendum boc.
"We're in favour of NATO and the EU, but we must enter proudly under our conditions, not with the command of others," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that the NATO membership will bring the much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after voting.
He said that a result in favour of changing the name would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Institute for Macedonia Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum - an amount below that of the required participation.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia TV Telem, found that 57 percent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order to make the referendum a success, participation should be 50 per cent and one more vote.
If the referendum fails, it represents a first serious blow to government policy in favour of Western ideology from the moment it took control in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, passing from all Brighton defences to ‘goal’
Sergio Aguero and Râ Sterling broke Brighton's defence in the 2-0 win of Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his ‘goal’ in 65 minutes seemed very easy.
The attacker from Argentina received a ball from half the grand at the beginning of the sequence.
From three Brighton defenders before going into open space.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players with green bubbles.
Fight one defender before fleeing much more with the edge of the Brighton box.
Then spread the ball on his left and found Sterling.
The British attacker sent the ball for the first time in the box to redistribute Aguero, who used the right foot to enter the ball to the right side of the net by passing it from where the goalkeeper of Brighton Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero is sending some problems to his family," said the city coach Pope Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about the fact that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We had the good luck he made 'goal' at that moment."
But it was Sterling that gave the initial advantage to Sky Blues in the fight against Premier League.
That ‘goal’ occurred within 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball deep inside the territory of Brighton in that action.
Send the ball right to Leroy Sane to the left in a very beautiful way.
Sane touched the ball a little before it led to Sterling where the rod.
The Sky Blues attacker touched the ball a little and entered it into the net just before sliding into a territory in which it was not supposed to enter.
City will play against Hoffenheim at the stage of the Champons League groups at 112:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer must play in spoiler vs. Rockies
Since Nationals were eliminated from the possibility to compete in the decisive game, there was no reason to make an effort to resume.
But the player so competitive Scherzer hopes to be the ‘pitcher’ on Sunday against the Rockies, but only if there are implications that the Rockies have the possibility to play in the decisive game, who are in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West NL with a single game.
The Rockies managed to get a chance to continue competing with the 5-2 victory against the Nationals this evening, but are still looking for the first title of the division.
"Although we are playing for nothing, at least we can have the possibility to win by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver is in the crowd and the other team is likely to play at the highest level of any point I can face this year.
What do you want to compete in those circumstances?"
Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but are allegedly inclined to let Scheer be the ‘pitcher’ in such a situation.
Scherzer, who is starting for 34 times, had a practice session on Thursday and will be playing as a pitcher on Sunday when he is generally resting.
The Washington player playing his right hand is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 ‘strikeout’ in 220 2/3 ‘innings’ at this season.
In addition, the Commission considers that there is a risk that the aid will be granted to the beneficiary of the aid.
The President referred indirectly to the situation relating to the selection for his Supreme Court, Britt Kavanwagh, speaking on the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"In November, everything we've done will be threatened.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is very great -- I challenge it, but in truth, I am challenging it therefore I am fighting everywhere to fight for very good candidates," he said.
"We are seeing this very horrible and radical group of Democrats, we are seeing it happen now," continued Trump.
And they are determined to take back power by using all possible means, you can see the green.
He does not care about those who hurt him, to those who want to fly in order to gain power and control, to those who want, power and control, we will not give them."
He said that the Democrats have a mission "to resist and hinder."
"And I have seen this over the last four four days," he said, and he was calling the Democrats "bitter and green and disgruntled and dishonest."
He referred to the Democratic Senate classified in the Committee of the Court of the Senate Diane Feinstein with her name, and received many negative voices from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Has the Document been issued?
Uh, uh, whatever.
No, uh no, I expect, first of all the movements of her body were not positive - the worst movements I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a large group.
It does not tolerate the communicationr's views
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to congratulate me, it did not take much.
After all, I'm the most recent MP in a list of MPs of the Labour Party that was not positively welcomed – because we communicated our views.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because she fought against anti-anthmity.
In my case, the movement of a critical census because I did not agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ionically, issues similar to those on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The notice for the Meeting of the Labour Party of Nottingham East on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the majority of my eight years as local MP Labour, the meetings of the General Council for the evening were exactly that.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more generous and gentle" policy has long forgotten whether, in fact, it has ever started in the truth.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable for party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I thought I had a similar political view began to expect to change my understanding and take positions that I would never agree with in other situations - both on national security and on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and, in truth, it doesn't make any difference – they go to war with abuse on social media with a request to be removed from my post of MP, demean the policy of the centre, and tell me that they don't have part of the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Yes, I know that I had more good luck than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I aim the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who daily face a lot of sexual or racist abuse but never hide from the comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the fact that levels of abuse have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad group and with any movement of "untrustlessness" or a change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrow.
I have been given a lot of advice over the past two years that have encouraged me to keep my opinions to me, so that I am not so vocal and then everything "be right."
But I did not get involved in politics to do so.
Since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, supported by the negligence of the Government of Switzerland that has left my comprehensive school class literally in a disaster state, I have sought to improve public services for those most in need – both as local councillor and as government minister.
I have never hidden my policy, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been, in any way, confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who have promoted the motion on Friday, all I say is that when the country is moving towards Brexit that will harm our families, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in truth, the only message I have not to for Nottingham Momentum, is for my constituents, whether or not members of the Labour Party: I am proud to work for you and I promise you that no amount of threats to be removed from my post or political experience will prevent me from acting in those I believe are your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, not yet lost, rising above the top of the grade
Two attempts could slightly change the outcome, but there was no doubt that Ayr was right to win this day's game so exciting of the Premiership Tennent's.
At present they are in class first, the only team from all ten that have not lost once.
In the end, it was the highest defence, as well as their capacity to take advantage of the opportunities, which helped the team, who was playing in his own brand, win, and the co-wheat Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We have been tested in our games so far, and we have not lost one, so I am happy," he said.
Robyn Kriste of Melrose said: "We give credit to Ayr, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we do."
With Grant Anderson's attempt in 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Climo, Ayr had been winning, but, yellow paper by the head of Scotland Roy Hughes, who was left to play the game from the Warors, gave Melrose the opportunity to try and Jason Bagbot made an unconverted attempt.
Clemo extended the win of Ayr with ‘penalty’, before, in the middle of the exact game, made ‘goal’ and converted an individual attempt to get the points 17-5 to Ayr into the puzzle.
But Melrose started the second part of the game well and the attempt by Patrick Anderson's, converted by Baggot, reduced the gap by 5 points.
Then stopped the game because of a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which came out of the grand on a screen, and as soon as the game started again, Ayr continued to remove the points after an attempt by Stafford McDowell, converted by Clemo.
Then, the chief agent of Ayr Bair Macperson was given a yellow paper, and once again, Melose came out with an aggression when they made an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, after a period of hard pressure.
However, the team that was playing in his own grand again started to attack, and when he was given a yellow card Struan Hutchinson for the action he had done on Climo without the ball, from the ‘penalty’ line, MacPherson sent the ball to the ground at the rear of the Ayr group that was advancing.
Clemo converted, as it did once again almost from the area from which the game started again, after Kyle Rowe collected the ball to David Armstrong's meetings from within the box and sent to Gregor Henry, who plays with the side, for the fifth attempt of the side she was playing in her own grand.
The personality of Still Game appears to be ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The individuality of Still Game Ford Kieran appears to be willing to enter the hospitality industry after it was discovered that it was referred to as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man who is part of Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC programme, who he writes and participates in with his long-term media partner Greg Hemphill.
The doo announced that the next nine series would be the last one of the programme, and it appears that Kieran is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the lists of official registers, he is the director of Adriftmour Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the history, although a source of Scotesh Sun showed that Kieran was seeking to engage in the "very good restaurant trade" of Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes that the court will again open a path to the Pacific
The seafarers remain vigilant of the naval headquarters armed with ropes and chains in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue blue ocean flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered by the motto: "The sea is our right.
That we recover it is a duty."
Around Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of the resources of the 19th century remains clear – as the desire that Bolivians be able to sail in the Pacific Ocean again.
That hope may be found at its highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"BOLIVIA has the momentum, spirit of unity and security, and obviously expects the result to be positive," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the ICJ on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find, in favour of Bolivia's statement, that – after decades of irregular talks – Chile is obliged to negotiate and give Bolivia a sovereign outlet for the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's Indigenous Carsimatic president – facing a controversial battle for his election next year – also has a lot to lose in the decision on Monday.
"We are very close to having access to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia – and that little change would have been made.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to give the territory of Chile, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the CJI judgment comes only six months after final arguments have been heard, indicates that the case "was not complicated" said Paz Zárate, an expert from Chile in international law.
And far from being disappointed by Bolivia's cause, the last four years may not have been helpful.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
The hostile relativism of Morales weakened any residual goodwill of Chile, it suggested.
Bolivia and Chile, at some point, will continue to speak, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions after this.
Both countries have not voted ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decision-making was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a "extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the "opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - was using the maritime issue as political aid.
"Bolivia will never exceed its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can trust the US
North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never disintegrate nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
He spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
Passes its comments as the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompeo, appears to have arrived at the resumption of nuclear diplomacy, which is more than three months after Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
It says that it is a "free hope" that the continued sanctions and US objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will never cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington is concerned about whether to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang making the first significant steps of disarmament.
Both Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump want the second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is serious to renounce armament that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion scenes reveal the latest collection of clothing for the massive head that is going to appear in the main shops.
If you want to add to the collection of your hats or fully cover the sun, you can stop looking.
The Valentino and Tom Browne designers have revealed a range of strange and very large head clothing for their Spring and Summer collection of 2019 on the runway that won the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Not very practical hats are seen very much on Instagram this summer and these designers put their surprising clips on the pal.
The article that leaped mostly from Valentino was an extravagous beige hat with a wide edge similar to the feathers that completely covered the heads of the models.
Other items of very large size included joint-coated mills, a hat and even anaesthetics - but are not designed to keep your head warm.
To them Browne also revealed a choice of strange masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Most coloured masks had the two twisted lips and were more like Hannabal Lecter than ‘Haute coture’.
One reaction was like the device of the full cherries with a snorkel and goggles, while another was like a rinded gel cone.
And if you continue with this good style.
Those who follow the fashion predict that huge bonnets will soon appear in the main shops.
The very big hats come out after the exit of La Bomba, the bee hat with a wide edge of two pages which was worn by everyone from Rahanna to Emily Rataki.
The 'cult label' responsible for the chapel that is not practical to anything that seemed very much on the social media made another big reaction on the counter - a straw bag containing almost as much as the dress model they were carrying.
The dark orange scaffolding basket, surrounded by a small, white-skinned sip, was the most complex creation in the spring and summer collection of Jacquemus in Paris Fashion Week, 2019.
Famousist Luke Armitage told your F.F.: 'I'm expecting to see a hat and large seabag in the main shops for the coming summer--as the designer has made a huge impact, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for very large accessories.'
John Edward: Skills in languages essential to global citizens
The independent schools of Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another set of excellent examinations results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to give their students and parents the best level of service.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, their chosen careers and their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalised school curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages remain the subject of popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If a man speaks in a language he understands, he understands.
If you speak his own language, he understands it."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examinations, we can see that languages are at the forefront of the classification tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who have studied foreign languages have achieved higher grade A.
The data collected from 74 schools that are members of the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students achieved higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who study German, 69 percent of those who study French and 63 percent of those who study Spanish also achieved A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages are now, as a subject option, kept in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that for reasons given by employers for sending to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more opportunities for prospective work requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Irrespective of the career of choosing, if you learn another language, this will have a real advantage in the future as it has the ability to survive such a life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically places a multilingual person at the top of the competition.
According to a survey by YGov of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a language well enough to maintain a conversation and, by 15 per cent, French is the only language spoken with two numbers.
That's why investment in language learning is now important for today's children.
Knowing more than one language, in particular those of developing economies, children will be better able to find significant work.
In Scotland, each school will learn different languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages which are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, there will always be a number of languages that you can choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future.
It cannot be denied at present, in a global business environment, that languages remain very important for the country's future, and this should therefore be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young Scotland.
The bit bit bit not feire.

On Sunday LeBron will play for the first time with the Lakers in San Diego
LeBron James' sports parties were unable to wait for him to start for the first time for Los Angeles Lakers.
The coach of Luke Walton Lacers announced that James will play in the game of opening before the season begins on Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the amount of minutes he will play has yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official web site of the Lakers.
The journalist of the Lakers Mike Trodwell wrote that, probably, James will play a limited amount of minutes.
After the earlier practice session this week, James was asked about his plans for the six pre-Lakers season schedule.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself," he said.
Falsification of Trump in West Virginia, YouTube Canal
President Donald Trump begins a wave of demonstrations of the campaign tonight in Weheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first demonstration of Trump from five scheduled next week, including stops in amicable places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote suspended for its choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the forthcoming mid-term elections as the Republics are at risk of losing control of the Congress when voting in Nova.
At a time is the demonstration of Trump in West Virginia tonight and how do you see it online?
The demonstration of Trump in Weheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, 29 September, 2018.
You can see the demonstration of Trump in West Virginia online below by means of a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for the candidate of Supreme Court Britt Kavanaugh, who became intense due to allegations of sexual misconduct with an early confirmation vote of the Senate suspended for up to one week while investigating the FBI.
But the primary objective of this wave of manifestations is to help the Republicans face the November elections to achieve a little momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that these five manifestations next week are aimed at "give power to volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the many they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The Congress Control is so important for this agenda that the president will travel as far as possible to the state as we approach the campaign season," he said to Reuters speaking to the rest of the rest of the campaign of Trump whose name is mentioned.
A schedule for the Wesbanco Aerna in Weheeling, the evening manifestation may gather participants from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the Pitsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump will be visiting West Virginia, the state that won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is losing out on the survey.
"It's not a good sign for Morissey that the president came to try to boost the survey," said Simon Heeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cup Ryder 2018: United States Team determined not to give up while approaching Sunday singles
After three sessions on one side, Saturday afternoon's photocaths could have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum startle of the momentum is a concept of fully vinced sport but one that players really believe in, and never more in such competitions.
So where do they say that you are the momentum now?
"These were in the front with six points and are now four, so I think we are carrying this as a little momentum," said Jordan Speth as soon as he left during the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four front points with twelve more to be met.
The Americans, says Spiteh, feel but have few obstacles and many things to encourage them, not at least the form of Speth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boast three points from four points.
Speth him was accurate from tea to green and is led by example.
That cry from the heart of a celebration continued to grow as it continued its round, by making a crucial putt to bring the fourth equal game when he and Thomas were two below two.
His sister who won the game on 15 was welcomed by a similar shout, the kind that tells you to believe that the American team is still there.
"Vera must enter deep and worry about your own item," said Speth.
This is what each of these players have done now.
18 holes to mark.
The only players with more points than Speth and Thomas over the last two days are Francisco Mollinari and
Europe's strange but sweet couple are four-four and are considered perfect.
"Moliwood" were the only pair that didn't darken on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Saturday morning bogeys, Friday afternoon and the 9th afternoon of the morning.
That scene, and the way their energy looks to move both to and from this life-cycle sets out that they are the players offering the Sunday challenge, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun falls on Le Golf National from Fleetwood or Molini.
Both would preferably suddenly be on different holes.
But here we are talking about a new, early European glory.
The Watson Bob and Webb Simpson were soon completed by Sergio García, the hero of the morning furballs, when he was put in a pair with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the nine front brought the Spanish and Swedish into a hole that they had never been able to get closer to.
But Sunday, there's nobody to help you get out of your hole.
Furballs and photomes are very impressive to see them closely due to peer interactions, advice they give, advice that they do not give and how a strategy can change into a second.
Europe has been better equipped as a team so far and is at the forefront of the final day, but this session of the Foursomes also showed that the US Team has the determination that some, especially on the US side, were doubting.
front Europe with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take a good advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after it has emerged from Saturday's bullballs and front-line photocams with 10-6 over the US.
The spirited pairlineline Fleetwood and Francesco Mollinari made the two-winning effort on Tyre Woods which found difficulty in taking their score so far ahead in the Le Golf National for four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjourn, ready to keep the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated by the American side that went wrong in the morning furballs, which took the series by 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the fountains, by winning two parties, but could not reach the difference in score.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from the 12 items of one Sunday player to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first new European for the season to win four points each other while he and Moliniari, vaccinated "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair that won four points from their four opening parts in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After dominated on Woods and Patrick Red in the Backballs then worked excellently to win Woods that did not seem optimistic and the new American player for the Bryson Dechambeau season with an even more empathic score of 5&4.
Woods, which found difficulty in both parties Saturday, showed occasional moments of a brillance but now lost 19 out of his 29 items in the quarterballs and the fursomes and seven successive ones.
Justin Rose, space for morning furballs, returned to the partner Herk Wsson in the Fursomes for a loss of 2&1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - which are classified first and third in the world.
However, it has not been all that Europe wanted in a beautiful day, with a slight leap in South-East Paris.
Jordan Spethh, a three-time winner, and Justin Thomas set the limit for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They obtained a brave win of 2&1 on Jon Rahm and Ian Pollter of Spain in the bullballs and later returned to win Pollter and Roy McLeroy with 4&3 in the Fursomes after they lost both opening holes.
It was only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that the team returned from a four-point difference while it was hanging in the singles, although the Houlders of the Furyk side need to draw to keep the trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, an attack on Sunday appears to be more than they can do.
North Korea says that "in no way" will unilaterally disaggregate without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations the Saturday that the continued sanctions were deepening its lack of confidence in the United States and that there was no way that the country would unilaterally leave its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
R Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "mandatory goodwill measures" last year, such as setting up nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site, and promised not to promote nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see a corresponding response from the US," he said.
"without any confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances in no way will we disaggregate ourselves unilaterally first."
While repeating family complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phasing" approach to denuclearisation in which North Korea was rewarded as soon as it took gradual steps, its declaration appeared significantly that it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation without thinking as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Refer to a joint declaration issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever held between a US president performing his duties and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work towards the “denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea was looking for a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also insisted calls to reduce the severe international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists on "denuclearisation first" and increases the level of pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their objective in a co-resistent manner, and also objects to the "end of war declaration," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can break us is a dream of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are deepening our lack of confidence."
He did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the part of this issue of denuclearisation was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have arrived at such a block."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the United States continental land with North Korea rockets was inevitable after Mr. Kantiv called Kim 'rotch man' on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take steps to disintegrate, but said that much work remained to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearised.
Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timetable for this, saying, "If you take two, three years or five months - don't make a difference."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, the Secretary of State of the United States Mike Pompeo, Thursday, said to the UN Security Council: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council should continue vigorously and without stopping until we realize the fully and finally verified denuclearisation."
The Security Council unanimously strengthened the sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with the aim of halting funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri at the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, after in a few hours North Korea criticized for making "gangster-like requests".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the US takes "correspondent measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students taking sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year managed to make all her students who have not yet graduated more sleep with the aim of fighting the growing macho culture to study all night and remain awake thanks to coffee.
An academic found that students in university in the first place in the world often have no idea of the basic real things about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which believes to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he made a speech about the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
"It's finally been told on me and she said: "Why are you saying this to me now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - to surprise me," said The Telephone.
The course, which started for the first time this year, explains to students the essential things about how good sleep traditions help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had a serious insomnia during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a schoolroom where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to cope with the effects of caffeine and light and on how athletic performance has an effect on sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine sleep time.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged insomnia may increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then, a camp map, with interactive mediocities, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change students' behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know--as much as you have right to know the effects on health when you choose to smoke cigarettes," added Prof Czeisler.
The culture that has been proud to "success you've been up all night to study" still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleeplessness was a growing problem.
Ensuring that it sleeps sufficiently, and of good quality, should be the "intense weapon" of a student to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, since sleeplessness puts the brain in hunger mode, which makes them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, who is studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to insist for a course around the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduates to make a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
The Czeisler Prof recommended that students should consider making alarms for when to go to bed, as well as for when to get up, and know about the harmful effects of "Blue Light" coming out of E-screens and LED light, which can balance your circadian rhythm, and lead to problems sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Ringers: The Menga Goal interrupts the men of Gerard
Rangers suffered another period of distress when they played abroad as Dolly Menga’s strike delivered the separated side of Steven Gerard for a loss of 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrax's side was looking to record their first victory while they were travelling from the quarterly win of February 4-1 in St Johnstone, but Gary Holding's team only caused the second loss of Gerard in 18 items as a manager to leave eight points away from the large leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time and the list of inspirationless Ringers players never seemed to have met.
While Rangers now descend to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and only after Hibernian on a difference of gowl.
And there may be more trouble for the Ringers after the linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in a head after a material was apparently removed by the parties of the team who played abroad.
Gerard made eight changes to the side that passed from Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt, went with the same Livi 11 that took a point from Hearts last week and was pleased with the way his well-trained form has continuously hindered their opponents.
Rangers could have dominated the possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They had to guess only two minutes from the start when the first time on the market of Menga sent Scott Pittman to a gooll of McGregor Gods but the midlayer took his great chance.
Free-kick of Keaghan Jacobs then found the skipper Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only act from behind.
Rangers achieved control but it seemed that there was more hope than belief about their game in the trick final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he had to have a penalty on the mark of fifteen minutes as he and Steven Lawless his friend but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian appeals.
Rangers managed to target only two shores well in the first half of the item but the former Goalkeeper of Ibrax Liam Kelly hardly ever worried about the sudden head of Lasana Colibaly and the lightestik of Ovie Ejaria.
While the first round of Livi in 34 minutes may have been when the other team was playing better, no one can deny that it was only enough for their effort.
Again, Rangers failed to manage a good set-point of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react as soon as Declan Galager detached the ball to Scott Robinson, which kept calm to choose Mega to finish the action.
Gerard reacted in the brake by changing Colibaly to Ryan Kent and the change almost provided an immediate impact as the weng detached in Morelos but the impressive Kelly happened from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to play exactly the type of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett who took a long ball after a long ball.
In addition, the Commission considers that the aid granted to the airport operator in the form of an aid measure does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton had another late request for penalty as he argued with Jacobs but once again Thomson looked the other.
Almanac: Geiger Container Inventor
And now a page from our "Saturday Morning" Almanak: 30 September, 1882, as is today 136 years old, and I HAVE TOD... the day on which the future physics Johns Willem "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, an invention which eventually led to the apparatus known as the Geiger Coin.
Science foundation since then, the Geiger Council has also become the foundation of popular culture, as in the 1950 film "Bles of Coronado," in which the most unlikely scientists see Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is the maduffles she is?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger connector, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When wearing these offices, you can actually hear the effects of the atomics that give radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "You say, certainly she's popular now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before it closed 63 years.
But the invention with his name remains alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, changing into a laboratory
They can then "see" a protein common to many cancers and then be injected again.
Trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, they are converted into the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein for many cancers called HER2, then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, U.S. National Cancer Institute in Behesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "driving the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach of immune cell uptake by patients and how to "learn" as they target cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West has made a Verbal Task Force Favor Trump, while he was dressed in the baritta of MAGA, after his mention on SNL.
This Is Not Good
Kanye West has been bombed in the seminar during Saturday Night Live following a confusion performance in which the US President Donald Trump commended and said he will go out for the election in 2020.
After listening to his third song of the night, named Ghost Town, in which he was dressed as Great Make America's Hebrew, he began to speak against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"How many times can I talk to a white person and say, "How can I please Trump, that racist?"
If I was concerned about racism, I had left America," he said.
SNL began the programme with a comedy chase in which Matt Damon appeared in which the
Although not broadcast, West's video was downloaded on social media by journalist Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to deduce you with West when he placed it.
In addition, West had complained with the audience who had taken him after the corner about his daughter.
"Pulse me after the tents.
They said, "Don't go out there with that house."
Bleed me!
Then they say that they lost," said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You have to see the lost? And he continued to say that he would "put on my superior's cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Produce with love."
His comments were prompted by at least twice the audience and the members of the SNL’s cassette appeared untended, reported Variety, with one person there who told the publication: "In all the student there has fallen a great silence."
West brought him as a late substitute for the Ariana Grande cant, which the boy friend she had, the Mac Miller rapper had died a few days ago.
West joined many with the performance of the song I love her, dressed as Perier's bottle.
West had the support of the president of the TPOSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most courageous spirits: GRAZZES OF FOLL."
But the presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply "what he and this is something beautiful millens."
"But I have not chosen to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his "art") that I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Another we," added she.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that it was now "what was previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Stady, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The previous rapper, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and of course the composer of music that is no longer with us Prince, changed his name to a symbol then the artist who was previously known as Prince.
A charge of attempted murder on silences in a restaurant in Belfatt
A 45-year-old man was accused of murder after a man was given knife moments in a restaurant in East Bellafest on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackmore, said the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Court of Courts of Courts of Belgium on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
The Game of Thrones Kit Hamington star speaks of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role to buy the sword as Jon Snow in the series of violent media fantasy of HBO Game of Thrones.
But the player, aged 31, spoke of the hero macho stereotypes, saying that such roles on the screen mean that the jury often feels that they want to be violent to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believed that "some thing went wrong" and had doubts about how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his collusion of Game of Throns Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he has "strong interests" to address the issue.
"Privately, I feel that I have a strong interest, right now -- where we've been wrong with masculinity?" said.
"What are we teaching men when they are growing up, in terms of the problem we have now?"
You believe that TV can be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through its very male characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes the junier feel that they want to be this certain side of a man?
I think this is one of the big questions in our day - how do we change it?
Because it is very clear that something has gone wrong for the juniper."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make prizes or seasons of Game of Thrones when the series came at its end next summer, saying that "so much war and horses".
As of November Kit will appear in the new production of Troy West of Sam Shepard which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who he left.
Recently the player revealed to her that when he met his wife Rose was the best thing he had come out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this program, so this way gave me my future family, and my life thereafter," he said.
Rose interpreted the part of Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, John Snow, in the series of the fantasy that won the Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 80,000 people are affected in the country, say health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 only around 40,000 new cases have been reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people taking HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in the Yannan province.
However, one year later, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV from sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was criminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is said to be common.
Because of country conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most disease transmissions stem from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses that a staff member revealed GOP server data, says "a dangerous lie" and "confused theories"
The representative of the United States Maxine Waters found the Saturday allegations that a member of its staff had posted the personal information of three U.S. year olds on the pages of Wikipedia of the legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles has ensured that the claims were being disseminated by puncts and ‘right-right-ultra’ websites.
"Gyde, lies and more lies of those who swindle him," said Watters in a statement on Twitter.
The information released allegedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers of the U.S. Secretarys Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hotch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capital Hill at a session of the Senate Board on allegations of sexual misconduct against the candidate of Supreme Court Britt Kavanwagh.
The disclosure took place some time after the three years questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Bundit and Red State reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and released the information of a Waters staff member, reported the Hill.
"This baseless allegation is completely false and absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My staff member – whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – has in no way been responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This baseless allegation is completely false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticism online, including from the previous press secretary of White House Ari Fleischer.
"This rejection is one of anger," wrote Felischer.
"It suggests that it does not have the tendency to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
It must not be resistant.
It shall not doubt the motives of the accused.
It shall be calm and bitter."
Fleischer appeared to have been comparing the response of Waters to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who was accused of being too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will come out to take the Waters seat in the mid-term elections, also mentioned his voice on Twitter.
"This is something great if it is true," he said on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned "the appropriate law enforcement authorities and bodies about these fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that authors are made aware," he continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their harmful and dangerous actions for each and all members of my staff."
Crickets of Johnny English Stricks Again - Rowan Atkinson, inseparably insemination
It has now become a traditional idea to look for Brexit's meanings in any new film with a British perspective and this seems to apply to the return of the franchise of Johnny English action-commencement - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and resumed life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is the authentic self-authorization on the subject of how bad we are, of course, the opportunity for a new country's export?
At any rate, the incompetent Johnny English with his large eyes and parts in his face that move unusually had the renewed licence for the second time to do everything wrong - that's more than anything else shows that it's a complex creation designed for territories of people who don't speak English.
It is of course the stupid secret agent who despite his strange claims to his sweet fascinate has a few from Clauseau, a hit by Mr. Bean and a large part of that man who contributed one note to the melodies of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony in London.
He is also originally based on the traveller and the international man of a mystery who once made his part in the TV Barclaycard advertisements, today forgotten, after leaving a caos behind.
There is a beautiful moment or two in this last issue of JE.
Bring me the moment when Johny English was approaching an elikoter while he was dressed in medicaments and the blades of the propeller were attached to his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's gift for physical chemistry appears, but humorism feels pretty poor and extra in a strange way, especially since the markings of the film "series" such as 007 and midwife I'll themselves offer the comedy as an ingredient in a confident way.
Humorism is felt as if targeted at children rather than adults, and for me the unfortunate strange incidents of Johnny English were not as inventive and focused as the silent film of Atkinson in the Bian person.
The perennial topical probation is now that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker filtered the very secret web network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, to the disappointment of the agent who was on duty - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the chair on the cake for the prime minister who is an immense and difficult figure, already suffering from a complete breakdown of political popularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this character as Teresa May but there is not much in the script to work.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy has been compromised, will have to bring someone retired.
And this means the incompetent Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in elegant buildings, but giving non-official lessons on how to become an inverted operational: I was very grateful here as English offers an academic of the sort of tours School of Rock.
English is taken back in Whitehall for emergency meetings and joins with his former partner of great patience, Bough, interpreted again by Ben Miller.
Bif now he is a married man, with a submarine commander, the role of one ostensibly interpreted by Vici Pepperdine, in which he is slightly deprived.
Therefore the two inseparables who are always confused in their Secret Service of Magnificence are back in action, when they meet with the character of a beautiful and beautiful woman Ophelia Bolletova interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the control of the billion of the sweet technology who claims that he can solve the problems of the British computer: the Chief Jason Volta, interpreted by Jack Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of fun funly conduct: dressed as Witts, fire to a high French restaurant, create a caus to climb up on Vulta's luxury yacht; and English begins a full anarchy as he tries to use virtual Reality offices to familiarize himself with Volta's home interview.
Certainly all stops lead to that last sequence, but as amicable and as selfish as it is, has little idea of a child television.
Something quite moderate.
And like the other Johnny English films I couldn't think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really deserves his talent?
Labour refuses to prepare a British plan for working a week of four days but paid for five days
The Jaremy Corbyn Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that will see British workers working a week of four days – but paid for five.
Supposedly the party wants the company teachers to pass on the residue made by the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them another day off.
This would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend – but still take the same wage with them.
Sources said that the idea would be "continuing" to the economic agenda and plans of the party that the country changes in favour of the workers.
The change for a week of four days was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
Senior Officer of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"This is not going to happen tomorrow but a four-day working week is an inspiration that fits with the party's approach to rebalance the labour economy as well as the global industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party is not the first to approve such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, aspiration is not currently approved by the entire Labour Party.
A speaker for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not party policy and the party is not considering it."
The Archbishop of Opposition John McDonnel used last week's Labour conference to clarify his vision for a social revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnel said that he was determined to take power back from "unonymous directors" and "sustainers" in utility firms.
The opposition canister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take their full share back as a Labour government can "reduction" on the basis of perceived misconduct.
It also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create inclusive Capital Funds to provide 10 per cent of private-sector firms' equity to employees, willing to take annual dividends up to €500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy says to "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can turn them into understanding
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanwagh delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by one week, and raises the question as to whether the findings of the busau could influence a Republican yearr from withdrawing its support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senates John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would lead them to change their understanding.
Kennedy seemed more open by his colleague than South Carolina.
"Shut up, and sure," said Kendy.
"I said and I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after he had done this, after he had issued that allegation, said, "Why?"
He was resolved, determined, inecovable."
However, Graham's vote seems difficult to change.
"I've already decided about Brett Kavanaugh and must be a very large charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett rejected her with strength," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And any person mentioned cannot verify this.
This is 36 years old.
I've seen nothing new change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Do What to Do to Reduce Poverty?
Next Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a very impressive list of visible stars and an equally impressive mission; ending world poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people returning to the Central Park Great Law, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and St. Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the true purpose of the event ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Governance Project, a group of representation with the hope of ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were ready to pay a VIP ticket), those going to the concert had to put an end to a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or some other significant ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the remaining 12-year Global Citizen been in achieving its objective?
The idea that people are rewarded with free concert is a genuine way of trying to persuade people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clictimism" - people feel that they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending gifts?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says that it has registered more than 19 million "actions" from those who place it, which I can reach a number of different objectives.
This says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion which are expected to affect the lives of over 2.2.5 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announced its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that so far the secure funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the diapers.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "help children grow to their full potential," with the promise that Rwanda will provide $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after having received more than 4,700 donations from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Trade Ulman to the crowd during a direct concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions to invite the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequent questions on his website that you ask "what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answered: "It will be a long and hard journey – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the large movements of civil rights and anti-partheid, we will succeed, because we have more power when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Wendender, List Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some artists who will appear at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US uses the Naval Fleet for "blocking" to hinder Russian energy exports - Internal Secretariat
"If necessary", Washington can resort to its Naval Fleet to prevent Russian energy from affecting markets, including the Middle East, revealed to the United States Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's growth in Syria - especially, where it operates with a legitimate government invitation - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are located in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," allegedly said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of addressing this.
"The US has the ability, with our Naval Fleet, to ensure that sea routes are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy has not arrived on the market," he said.
Zinke has been addressing those who attended the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that seeks to attract itself as the "energy consumer voice" in the US.
He continued to compare Washington's approaches in addressing Russia and Iran, by noting that they are effectively the same.
"The economic choice over Iran and Russia is, to some extent, the leverage and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-skilled person" with an economy that depends on carbonated fuels.
The following statements are made as the administration of Trump was on a mission to strengthen its export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of the Trump administration, including the President of the United States Donald Trump himself, try to presuppose Germany to exit the "improper" gas project Nord Stream 2, which according to Trump, made Berlin the "method" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 gas of $11 billion, which is expected to double the existing gas capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
Cremlin argues that the intense opposition of Washington to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said the Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main organisation for industry, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), invited the United States to stay away from Europe's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Canciller Angela Merkel and President Russu Vladimir Putin.
Elisabeth Warren Ser "School Review" If you are going out for a President in 2020, Tell the Masachusts Senate
The Senator of Massachusts Elizabeth Warren, Saturday said that he would "make a good examination" of whether to go to a president after the mid-term elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that it considers it to be out.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and strengthen our broken government and this includes a woman in the highest position," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will examine carefully whether I will go to a president."
Warren commented about President Donald Trump during the council meeting, saying that he was " taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was direct in her criticism of Trump and his nomination to the Supreme Court Bert Kavanaugh.
At the end of Friday, Warren said "naturally we need an investigation of the FBI before the vote."
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own constituents do not think that they should be elected in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters of Massechusts said that the senior should not go out for the election, according to the survey of the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globee.
Thirty-two percent supported the election issue.
The survey showed more support for the election exit by the former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting a potential election exit and 48 per cent against him.
Other high profile democratic names discussed in relation to a potential exit for the 2020 election include former Vice-President Joe Biden and the Secretary of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said that he officially decided by January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin refers to the PTSD of Track Palin in the demonstration of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent one year in Iraq after it was registered in September
He was arrested and subjected to an incident of domestic violence on Monday night
"What I'm going through is my son, what he's going through after he's returned, I can relate to other families who feel the responsibilities of the PSD and some of the wounds our soldiers return with," said the audience in a demonstration for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the obvious problem that no one is addressing" and said about her son and other prisoners of war, "they return slightly different, return stronger, retort to think whether there is that respect for what other soldiers like them and air personnel, and every other member of the military, gave to the country."
He was arrested in Wasila, Alaska, and subjected to a domestic violence attack on a woman, interrupting with a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons while he was a victim, according to Dan Bennet, speaking to the Police Department of Isilla.
18 states, D.C. supports a challenge for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District are supporting a legal challenge to a new United States policy that rejects asylum for victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18th state and district, Week submitted a case of court friend in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the actor in the Grace case against the Sessions that the American Union of Civil Freedoms put forward in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and the boys members of his violent gang," abused her but the US officials rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
It was held in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, as the nations face persistent problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy injured a 2014 decision by the Board of Migrant Appeal which allowed undocumented immigrants to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Friday, in a statement, the Attorney General of the Columbia District, Carl Racine, said that the new policy "neglects decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum claims to be judged on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such reasoning violates this principle, said the case of a court friend.
The lawyers continued to argue in the event that the policy to deny immigrants income harms the US economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop giving asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Emergency is available to those leaving their country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his policy announcement on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems -- even all serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Life-saving efforts in Palau as the number of deaths doubles in the fight against time to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become increasingly terrible.
"You feel very intense," said a 35-year-old mother, Rissa Kusuma, while she was embracing her son with a fever at an evacuation centre in the unfortunate city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulance brings the body.
Clean water is scarce."
The residents seemed to return to their homes destroyed, looking for their water-stricken things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, destroyed by the earthquake of 7.5, were too filled.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a fracture in their hair and shoulder, remained outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside of continuous strong shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he told that he felt the violent earthquake moved the floor of the hotel in the fifth floor he was using with his wife and daughter.
"There was no chance of saving ourselves.
I was crushed with wall residues, I think, "Haris said to Associated Press, and added that his family was in place for a wedding.
"I heard my wife shout for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda advertisements"
One week after a Chinese official newspaper issued a advertisement on four pages in a daily United States newspaper trying to sell the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador for China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The President of the United States Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to the paid supplement of China Daily in the Dis Moines Register - the newspaper that is sold mainly in the state of Iowa - after accusing China seeking to enter the U.S. Congress elections of 6 November, accusing China of rejecting it.
The charge of Trump that Beijing was trying to enter the US elections marked what the US officials had told Reuters that it was a new phase in a campaign that was closing out of Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to make advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a failing trade war that has seen them pass tariff rounds on each of them's imports.
China's retaliation fees at the beginning of the commercial war were designed to touch exporters in states such as Ioa which supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terri Brand, the US ambassador for China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods for China, said that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote on a page of opinion in the Sunday's Dis Moines Register, "now doubles this buliling by making propagandist ads in our own free press."
"In the dissemination of its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the best tradition of America of free expression and free picture by placing advertisements paid in the Dis Moines Register," wrote Brandt.
"In contrast, on the stand of newspapers down the road here in Beijing, you will find limited voice of dissemination and you will not see a true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people can have on China's problematic economic trajectory, as the media are found under the restriction of the Chinese Commonist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoids the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
The Republics Are Dismissing Women's Votes Before the Mid-Tremen Elections by the Kavanaugh Debate, Measuring the Analists
As many Republicans of the top are supporting and defending the candidate of Supreme Court Bert Kavanwagh facing various allegations of sexual assault, the analysts warned that they would see an adverse reaction, particularly during the forthcoming mid-term elections.
Feelings of this were very high, and most Republicans are already officially showing that they wanted to lead by vote.
These things can't be reversed," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School to The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubts that the last minute's motivation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (R-Arizonia) for an FBI investigation will be sufficient to deal with angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national speakers for the MoveOne progressive group Friday, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
Friday morning, the demonstrators sang "November is here!" as they protested in the Senate Hall as the Republics that are controlling the Judicial Committee decided to run the Kavanaugh designation despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's declaration, reported Mike.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high, said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst who is not part of the news site.
"People are saying they were already high; and true.
"But they may be higher, in particular between women voters who change the vote in sub-borges and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, while not welcome by the president, often do not vote."
Other information: He was a member of the Russian Federation, a member of the Russian Federation.
"This has become a complete disappointment for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"This does not concern only the committee's vote or final vote on whether Kavanwagh is placed on the bank, it also concerns the way Republics manage this situation and how they deal with it," pointed to the news station Guy Cecil, director of Paris USA, a group that helps to elect the Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somehow divided on those who believe in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with little support for the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents definitively or probably believed the Ford declaration, while 35 per cent said they believed definitively or probably the Ford declaration.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied during his statement, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the push from Falake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations filed by Ford as well as at least another accused, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed to the Senate Judicial Committee under an oath last week that Kavanwagh while a victim attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court candidate exposed his genitalia to her while they were in a state when they were studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor plans to start a New Internet to compete against Google and Facebook
Tim Bernards-Lee, the World Wide Web inventor, will launch a new business that seeks to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last technology literature project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Breners-Lee's Open Source Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Bernards-Lee agreed that the intention behind Inrupt is "world dominance".
"We need to do it now," he said about the new business.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Sold technology to allow people to create their "personal online data shop" or POD.
This may contain contact lists, lists of what to do, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spofty are all available on one and all at the same time.
What makes the store of single personal data online is that it is fully in the hands of the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal autonomy through data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is that the company brings resources, process skills and appropriate skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform brought by IBM, some staff developers who have a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer volunteers.
By starting this week, technology developers worldwide can create their decentralised applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Bernards-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they should introduce a complete change where all their business models are turned down from day to day.
"We don't ask their permission."
On a medium site published on Saturday, Bernards-Lee wrote that "the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial and ecosystem energy to help protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid."
In 1994, Bernards-Lee transformed the Internet when establishing a World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Bernards-Lee has been a voice of influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even when launching Enrupt, Bernards-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm an immeasurably optimistic for this next year of the web," added Bernards-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebrated clerical of Victoria Cross of World War I
The only clerical of the Church of England who won Victoria Cross during World War I was celebrated in his village 100 years later.
Other information: He was a member of the Russian Federation's armed forces.
However, he was killed by Sniper four days later and never knew that he won the highest British military honour.
Saturday a commemorative stone was discovered by his two nephews in a parta in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, said that it was "imbling in a brilliant manner" that the stone had to be exposed just 100 years after the victory of the victory of Nanuh's prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, the Lt Kour led his battle on the other side of the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in many pairs and fire from on-the-spot clubs and machine guns."
Later he rushed to the line of fire and with "great courage" led the line forward before going to a sword on the ground alone and lost three senses from the force.
The Lt Cur was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that the actions of Naanh were "something that I know I can never get there but something very humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a girl in the back of the apartment, which was led by the Independent Youth Band of Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that he was "feeling very honored to have played a part in this part of the world" and added "the courage of a genuine hero was being demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people."
MOA Parties remained up all night to see Bellator 206 instead finished with Pepa Pig
Imagine this, you have been awake all night to see Bellator 206 packed to end a denial from seeing the main event.
The list from San Jose included 13 battles, including six on the main card and were being shown direct overnight in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
In 6am, as Gregor Mousasi and Roy MacDonald were preparing to confront each other, explorers in the United Kingdom remained bleated when the broadcast changed to Pepa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they had remained up until early hours especially for the fight.
One party on Twitter described the change to the children's carton as "some kind of fun. "
"It is a government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was not appropriate therefore had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, senior president of the Bellator's marketing and communication, when asked about transmission.
"Peppa the island," yes."
The president of the company Belator Scott Coker said that they will work on their scheduling to include explorers from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think that when I think about repeat, we probably can fix something," said Coker.
"But at present there are the six in the morning of Sunday and we will not be able to arrange until Sunday of our time, the Monday of their time.
But we are working on it.
Emmeani, when the broadcast turned, there were many ongoing messages and not all were sweet.
We were trying to fix the solution, thinking it was a technical mistake.
But it was not, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We'll limit it to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to get more to the supporters and instead we've gone too far.
It's a unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt "inferior" due to sexuality
The Olympic Tom Daily counts say that it has grown to feel inferior to everyone because of his sex – but it has given him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said that he had not realized unless he went to the secondary school that "not everyone like me."
Speaking on the first Diet Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Laurent Laverne, he said he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give a "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent he was less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the program that has been going on, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
While he appeared to be abandoned on Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt "lesser than" he and he grew up because "it was socially unacceptable to like you boys and girls."
He said: "To date, those feelings that you feel less than, and feel different, have been the true things that have given me the power and strength that I can succeed."
He wanted to prove that it was "something", said, not to disappoint everyone when they eventually get to know about his sex.
The Bronze Olympic Medalist for twice became a high profile promoter for LGBT and used his appearance in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to criminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky that he could live free without compromise and wanted to give a "hope" to others.
The world winner three times said that when he became a man - film producer from the US Dustin Lance Black, he met him in 2013 - "was surprised" for him.
Daley married Oscar's winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year but said that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When he went through so many things at such a small age – he went to his first Olympics of 14 years and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar beautiful and painful experiences.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, for me the important thing was that 'I want to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 of 40 years after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die and one of the things he had asked was if they had already had the tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'You won't be here to be in the front row, pà'," he said.
"We were holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was not until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally recognized that he was not invincable," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the Olympics in 2012 and won the Bronze.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life-- to bow in front of a crowd from countries in the Olympic Games, there was no better sensation," he said.
It also inspired the first choice of his song - a Professor of Heather Small - which was compatible with him in walking to the Olympics and still won the bar.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Blackellson who no longer in shape remains on the bank in the Ryder Cup Saturday
The Americans Phil Mickelson will record Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to change his shape to avoid being such an important step not so happy.
Mickelson, who plays at the biennial event for a record of 12 times, remained on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's bullballs and photomes.
Instead of being the centre of action, as it was often for the US, the big winner five times the day’s field between he was supporting and working on his game from the distance with the hope to rectify what he was worried about.
One who never would have given the ball right even in the mile of his career, the 48-year-old man is not ideal for the difficult course of Le Golf National, where the long distance was once again afloat and punishes wrong schuts.
And if the course alone is not of enough heart drop, Mickelson, in the ninth Sunday game, faces the exact bells of the British Open Francesco Mollinari, who joined the
If the Americans, with four points less than the beginning of the 12 single game, start well, the Mickelson game can show that it is a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he played today, took care of me and put his arm around me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"They have a lot of confidence in themselves.
He Hall of Famer and contributed a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably did not see him playing two parties.
I saw more, but this is the way she did and this is the way we thought she would go.
He wants to be out there, like others."
Mickelson will go beyond Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup items played Sunday.
This can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has rather never reached its millions of individual records.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said that his presence brought some intangible things to the team.
"It's sulky, sercastic, funny, like to laugh with people, and a very good man to be in the team room," explained.
"I think the younger players took pleasure in critical it, this week, which was something fun to see.
It provides much more than just games."
European Master Thomas Bjour that the high front position can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjourn, the European master, knows from the experience that a front position narrowed before the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily change into a uncomfortable journey.
The Danish made its debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Balesteros retained an advantage of five points on Americans but ended with a bend with a narrow true margin, with a win of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a leading position in Valderrama; we had a leading position in Brookline, where we lost, and Valderrama, where we won, but slightly," said Bjour, in the press, after seeing the 2018 Class winning both Fridays and yesterdays to be on beds with 10-6 in the National Golf.
So history will show me and everyone in this team that has not yet finished everything.
Tomorrow you go with yourself and your body.
Get out there and do all the good things.
It did not end until you got the points on the team.
We have a purpose, and what he tries to hide this trophy, and the focus will remain there.
I always said, I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we know well what's on the other side -- the biggest players in the world."
Confident of how his players played on a difficult golf course, Bjourn added: "Never go to a step oltrè from me in this.
A different challenge remains.
Tomorrow concerns the individual performances we see, which is something different to do.
It's very nice to be out with a partner when things are going well, but when there's out individually, then you'll be tested for your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message that wants to pass on to players, which issues your best tomorrow.
Now, let the partner behind you and he wants to leave and get out his best, too."
In contrast to Bjourn, the opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to play better individually than when they did as partners, with exceptions being Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas, who acquired three points from four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of those last days that can change everything, after being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he finished speaking as Europe made the "Medinah Sea."
"I remember to the least word from it," said in response when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the master in 1999, prepared for his players before the last day.
"We don't have 12 important items, but you want him to come to that start quickly as I saw in Brooklyn, as I saw in Medinah.
When that momentum arrives on one side, place a lot of pressure on those middle parties.
We have drawn up our list as appropriate and put those men in the way we felt, you know, we are trying to do some miracles tomorrow."
Thomas had been given the task of trying to lead the fight back and face Roy McLairy in the best game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, () Fleetwood and Ian Pollter the other Europeans in the best half of the order.
"I go with this group of men in this way because I think it covers the whole road," said Bjorn about his singles choices.
Germany's new war postponed again
The most new German Naval Fleet frigate had to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Bieda War eras, but it will not be there until at least next year due to systems with increasing defects and costs, reported local media.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Palkal", the main ship of the new famous brands of the Baden-Wuertteberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military speaker.
The vessel had to join the Naval Fleet in 2014, but the problem issues following delivery cast the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuertteberg class vessels that ordered the Naval Fleet back in 2007 will come as a replacement for the ageing Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a strong cannon, an exhibition of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some causal technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic masks.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods – this should be possible to operate the most new frigids up to two years away from home ports.
However, a continuous delay means that the ships of the last technology - mentioned to allow Germany to project power outside the beach - will already be old to date when they enter the service, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 season of ill-treatment appeared in the news last year, when the German Naval Fleet officially refused to commission the ship and returned to Bloohm & Vos Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Naval Fleet returned a ship to shipbuilding after it was delivered.
Little has been known about the reasons for this, but the German media quoted a number of crucial "programming and hardware defects" that the ship has rendered useless if it is deployed on a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important as the Baden-Wuertteberg class ship will be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers - only half of the workers on the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it appeared that the ship has a very heavy burden to reduce its performance and limit the ability of the Naval Fleet to add future updates.
The "Rheinland-Palk" of 7,000 tonnes is understood to be twice as heavy as vessels of a similar class used by Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this has reached an alarming amount of €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) – from an initial €2.2 billion.
The problems of the most new frigids become especially important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Pete Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Naval Fleet currently "has a lack of vessels to withstand deployment."
The official said that the problem had grown over time, as old vessels were commissioned but replacement vessels were not provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuertteberg class frigates could not join the Naval Fleet.
National Trust is mentioned on the secret life of bats at night
New research being carried out on land in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape when they search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will show a new light on the behaviour of single mammals flying and helping guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common Pistrelles and soprano as well as brown bats with long ears and Daubenton in the Inverewe Garden in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-holding detectors.
An expert analysis of the sounds of all the recordings will ascertain the frequency of calls of bats at night and what species you are doing.
A habitat map and a report will then be produced that will create a detailed picture of the scale of their behaviour landscape.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of pastures and how best to maintain forest for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and around the United Kingdom decreased considerably over the past century.
They are under threat from building and development work affecting houses and habitat losses.
Wind and light turbines can also pose a risk, such as poison paper to catch insects and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are currently not blind.
However, because of their invisible hunting traditions their ears are more useful than their eyes when they come to catch the prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location techniques to indicate insects and obstacles to their passage when flying.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats at night very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, house inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organisation has even established the first and only reserve of Scotland’s bats in the Threave land in Dumfries and Galloway, which welcomes eight of the ten species of Spanish bats.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a very good area for bats tonight," he said.
"We have the ancient buildings, manyveteran trees and all good habitats.
But there is much more about bats that is not yet known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about what they need to flourish."
It stresses the importance of checking bats for the maintenance of properties since it is possible that the unintended destruction of a single maternity nest could kill up to 400 women and young people, possibly destroying a whole local population.
The bats are protected and illegal to kill them, punish them or afflict them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrille, a Scottish official for the Fleeding Reserve Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats at night and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations as lawyers are ready to search for a German magazine
Cristino Ronaldo pointed out claims of rape against him as "false news," by saying that people "must promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are expected to search with the court the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The racer of Portugal and Juventus, who plays in the front, was accused of rape of an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He alleged that at the time he had left her $375,000 to say nothing about the incident, reported Der Spiegel Friday.
Speaking on video on Instagram Live with his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, marked the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the winner of Ballon d'Or five times while he looked in camera.
"We must promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They must become famous to say my name, but this is part of the work.
I'm a happy man and everything goes well," the player added, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to seek out in court Der Spiegel about the allegations, which they have called "inadmissibility reporting of suspects in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Dr Christian Schertz said that the player seeks compensation for "moral damage in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the breach, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident was reported to have taken place in June 2009 in a room in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly studied it from anus, according to documents submitted at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his recovery after the alleged incident and told her that it was "99 percent" "good man" disappointed by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that they were both sexually related, but that this was by consensus.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to a solution out of court because she felt "bitter of retaliation" and was concerned that "it is publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says that she is now seeking to change the solution as it is still traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo had come to join Real Madrid by Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he walked with the legacies of the Italian football Juventus in an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "sorrying forever" that car manufacturers have lost
The United Kingdom "will regret it forever" if it loses its status as world leader in the manufacture of cars after Brexit, said the Secretary of Business Greg Clark.
He added that it was of "concern" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, it temporarily stopped production at its factory in Burnston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of a delay at the borders in the case of Brexit of no agreement would cost jobs.
The Burnston plant - which makes Auris and Avensis of Toyota - produced almost 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see a stop in production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's management director in Burnston.
Other UK manufacturers raised fears of leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Minni plant for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the case of Brexit of no agreement.
Today's Toyota production line works on a "accident in time", with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the United Kingdom and in the EU for cars carried out in order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a border disruption that the industry claims could lead to delays and spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to maintain an inventory of more than one day at its Derbyshire plant, said the company, and therefore production is stopped.
Mr Clark says that the Theresa May Chequers plan for future EU-related solutions is "klibbled precisely to avoid these border controls."
"We need an agreement. We need to have the best agreement to allow, as I say, not only the success to enjoy at present but to seize this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4 Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we need to absolutely be able to continue what was a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not state for a time how much production was stopped, but in a longer period, it warned that increased costs would reduce plant competitiveness and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallarris, who worked in Bornaston for 24 years and is the defendant of the Unite union at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience when these jobs leave, never return.
A government speaker said: "We wanted a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The Trump meeting with Rosmstein can be delayed again, says White House
The risky meeting of Donald Trump with the deputy general lawyer Rod Rossensstein can "be delayed by another week" as the fighting against the Supreme Court candidate Bert Kavanwagh continued, said the White House Sunday.
Roshentin takes care of the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's aid and Russia and a potential obstruction of justice by the president.
If Trump is going to expel the deputy general lawyer or not, thus endangering Mueller's independence, an angry Washington appeal for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Roshanstein discussed wire clothing to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through 25 amendments.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, although there were reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said that he "prefers to" not to Rossenstein but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid misappropriation with the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation of Kavanaugh's claims over a period of one week, which delayed further a full vote of the Senate.
Sunday, the press secretary of Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "There has not been a date set for this, it may take place this week, and it may be the following week because of all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But now we see and I always like to keep the picture up-to-date."
Some journalists challenge this claim: Sanders has not been organising a press meeting in White House since 10 September.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of meetings was not due to a lack of grace with TV journalists "to try to attract and influence the audience", although she said: "I agree with the fact that they try to attract and influence the audience."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president makes more questions and answers sessions compared to any president that had agreed," added she without quoting any evidence: "Look at those numbers."
The meetings will still be held, said Sanders, but "if the picture has the chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, this is far better than to speak to me.
We try to do this very much and we have seen it many times in the last few weeks and this will replace the press meeting where one can talk to the US president."
Trump rarely answers questions when leaving the White House or when participating in open sessions or press conferences when visiting the shrines.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president has probably shown why he behaves in a relaxed and sometimes strange manner to groups of journalists.
The health secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland on Brexit-related fears
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the gratitude and desire of the country that they remain there after Brixit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter when it remained less than six months to leave the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Government has already committed to the cost of status applications defined for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on exit continued, moving towards expected decisions this summer.
But the United Kingdom Government was also increasing its preparations for a possible scenario of no agreement.
I know this is certainly an unstable time for you all.
That's why I want to support now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and are beneficial to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely home to you and I wish you very much to stay here."
Crisis Abercrombe performs Emergency surgery After Aggression in Rase
The Linebacker Crisis Abercrombee of the Tennessee State Tiggers performed an emergency surgery after having suffered an injury on Saturday when his team lost against the Vanderbilt Commodores by 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The State main coach of Tennessee Road Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the halftime.
"He went on the sideline and as it fell there," said Reed.
The trainer and medical staff gave Abercrombee oxygen on the sideline before putting it on a sticker and then took it over for further examination.
A State official of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombe had not yet been operated in the Medical Centre of Vanderbilt.
Harris added that "to date there is no detail about the type/exhaust of the injury" and the State of Tennessee is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombee, a student in the second year of the university suspended, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after leaving Illinois.
Saturday in total he had five trickles before he came out of the game, which led to a total of 18 trickle of his season.
Foreign buyers will be asked to pay more charges for stamp tax when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be asked to pay more tax on stamps when buying over-money property in the United Kingdom is used to assist homeless people under new Tory plans
This change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in stamp tax will be imposed on non-tax payers in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects it to rise to €120 million per year - to help homeless people
Today Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers should pay a higher stamp tax rate when buying property in the UK - with extra money being used to help us homeless people.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and target high-payers.
The increase in stamp tax will be imposed on individuals and firms that do not pay a tax in the United Kingdom, with extra money boosting the Government's efforts to fight road sleep.
The additional payment - which is additional to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on the second housing and rental purpose purchases - could be three percent.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to €120 million per year.
Some 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by non-United Kingdom residents, which are increasing prices and thus making it more difficult for new buyers to take the first step in the housing purchase phases.
Many rich areas of the country - particularly in the capital city - have become "famous cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers spending much of their time abroad.
The new policy was issued only a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in stamp tax so that more young people would be helped to buy their first house.
He charged large construction firms that were maintaining high property prices by blocking the land and not using it, and urged Ms May to abandon allowances on affordable houses to correct the "depression situation of housing shame" in the United Kingdom.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed eye-stricken housing reforms, including checks on rent and the end of "no fault-free" dismissals.
It also wants to give the councils great powers to build new houses.
Ms May said: "The past year I said that I would dedicate my job to restoring the United Kingdom's dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And this means adjusting our broken housing market.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is unfair for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies to find it easy to buy houses as high as the UK residents.
For many people the dream of having a home has become too far away, and the indignity of sleep on the streets remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland"
The head of Sandland Jack Ross says that his "fundamental ambition" is to ever become Scotland's manager.
The 42-year-old Scotland welcomes the challenge of re-creating the North-East club, currently third in League One, with three different points from the one in the first place.
This summer he moved to a Stadium of Light after guiding St Mirren back to the Scotland Premiership at the last season.
"I wanted to play for countries as a player.
I found B cap and nothing more," Ross said to the BBC Sport of Scotland's BBC.
"But when I was still a child I often went with my father to see Scotland playing in Hampden, and it always remains that thing that attracted me back.
However, this opportunity will only be given if I succeed in managing a club."
Those who came before Ross as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Goddace, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kene, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic states that he was not concerned about the fact that he would have followed such established names in such a large club, while he had previously rejected the offer by the City of Barnsley and Ipswich.
"As at now, the success for me will be based on "I can once again deliver this club to Premier League"?
Because of the structure and facilities of this club there is no doubt that this club belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I probably think I've succeeded here only if I succeed in taking the club back there."
Ross has been in his career for only three years as a manager, after a period of head assistant in Dombardon and after spending 15 months with Hearts clearing staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from the relegisans for the third category, and transformed St Mirren from the edge of the relegisans for winners of the title of the next season.
And Ross says that he is now feeling more comfortable than he felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
With regard to the taking of Alloa, he recalled that "it was probably a major change."
"I thought in general that the position of manager was the most appropriate one for me, much more than that of a player.
This may sound strange by going well, having a decent lifestyle, and enjoying reasonable achievements.
But games can be difficult.
There are many things you have to pass through every week.
I still experience this in terms of stress and pressure of work but I simply feel that the post of manager is suitable for me.
I have always wanted to manage and now I am doing this, and I feel that throughout my adult life now I am feeling the most comfortable."

Survey finds that the best time to take a beer pin is 5.30pm in the evening
The summer heat wave has boosted the profits of United Kingdom pubbs in difficulty but has put more pressure on the restaurants of the same company.
In July, groups of pops and bars saw a 2.7 per cent increase in sales – but figures revealed that the return on restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant, who collected the figures, said: "Non-continuous and longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July had followed a similar pattern for the previous month of June, when the sale of dolls increased by 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were hit even more.
The 1.8 per cent reduction in restaurant trade in June continued to worsen in July.
The pops and bars whose main sales are drinks were those that went most well in terms of financial results compared to the previous period while the sales of restaurants decreased.
The pops whose main sales are food have also suffered in the heat, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It appears that people simply wanted to get out of drinking.
In the pops and bars managed the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, while food fell to three per cent."
Paul Newman, one of the RSM analysts on entertainment and hospitality said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sport events remain the biggest factors in terms of market sales of the taxi-way.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent a year later will be particularly burdensome in addition to continuing cost pressures.
The hot and long summer could not come in a worse time for operators whose main sales are food and only time can advise us whether the more moderate temperatures experienced in August will provide much-needed rest."
The growth of total sales in pops and restaurants, including the opening of new businesses, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow decline in start-up of new businesses.
The monitoring of the sales of the United Kingdom’s Copper Peach Tracker industry to the pulp, barbars and restaurants sector collects and analyses the performance data from 47 operational groups, with combined revenues of more than €9 billion, and is the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
Survey reveals that 1 in 5 children - some of them at the age of 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the pages of the "Insta Falls"
News should be very scared that sexual content is being placed
Twenty percent of students said they have a "key" account to show their parents
One in five children – some at the age of 11 – are creating social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed rapid growth in the "Insta Falls" accounts - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
News should be a major fear that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a "key" account that is available to show their parents, while having others private.
A mother who met the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a young woman who was encouraging others to take her back - "store me."
Research, from the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmists' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of young people 11-18 years of age had two profiles, with half admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC Head Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that many young people are excited about creating online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will become the "voice for athletes" on the Scottish Italian board
Elidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Ethics Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most enthusiast of the course and not the most successful of the medals and President Ian Beatie described this change as a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from her vast experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletic community and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly by becoming part of the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and hope that I can really contribute and help to lead sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Games in Atlanta among its total four gold medals of the Olympic Games and who is now a regular criticism of the BBC, ended up not walking after having suffered from a small stroke.
On Twitter he wrote: "As today he gave me a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors have said that only time can advise us whether or not I recover or to what extent.
It was a hard work but I recovered completely, learned how to relive and today I am doing exercises of morality!
Thanks to the encouragement messages!"
A breast pump advertising comparing mothers with cows gives rise to different opinions online
A breast pump company has given rise to different online opinions with advertising comparing breast-feeding mothers to discarded cattle.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered "the first breast pump in the world that can be worn and that does not make you angry", the consumer technological company Elvie released inspired advertising from an ionic music video to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers using the breast pump.
Four real mothers are buried in a herd filled with cattle bee with a disc that includes a poem such as: "Yes, I swear to myself but I don't have a tail" and "In case I don't hear these are not a pig but a breast."
The corus continues: "Pop out, pop out, I am feeding my babies, pumping out, pumping out, I am turning to my women."
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page caused online controversy.
With 77,000 exhibitions and hundreds of comments, the video received different reactions from viewers, many of which say that this sheds light on the "territorial" of the dairy industry.
Someone wrote "It was a very bad decision that the cows are used to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and born to produce milk, except that their babies are taken to them within a few days of their birth".
Elvie’s breast pump lies in a breast-feeding needle without it being in the eye (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else commented: "One understands that this is a traumatic thing for both the mother and the baby.
But why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "Reclame really cut off from reality."
Others defended the advertising, with a woman admits that she found the disc "very fun."
"I think this is a genetic idea.
If I had still been breast - feeding, I would have bought one.
The pumping made me feel the same as a cow.
The advertising is a little bit or too hard but I took it to him.
This is a genetic product," wrote someone.
Someone else commented: "This is fun advertising aimed at the mothers who pump (often at their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cakes".
This is not a advertisement that commends or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video the group of women discovers that they were all suffocating with the pumps that don't give in the eye placed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their masters say they feel like cattle.
However, Elvie Pump, does not make any noise, has no wire or tube and sits in a breast-feeding needle without giving in to the eye, thus giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even leaving while they are pumping.
Anna Balarin, a partner and ECD in Mother commented: "The Elvie Pump is a so random product that it deserved a bold and pro-provative launch.
By comparing women who use the breast pump with dairy cows we wanted to focus on the breast pump and all the challenges it presents, while showing in a fun manner and in a way that can be related to it, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time Elvie pump appeared on the news.
During the London Cashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the cactoluk for the designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Go Without Words to Tinnitan Camp at Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has increased dramatically despite the fact that the monthly border crossing has remained unchanged, partly because of the historical and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration made it more difficult for children to be placed with a spontaneous.
Traditionally, many spontaneous immigrants were not documented themselves, and feared that if they present themselves to care for a child they would endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that a potential spontaneous and other adult members of their mail would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before the Congress that the agency arrested tens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"About 80 per cent of individuals who are either a spontaneous or members of the household of a spontaneous are here in the country illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
So we continue looking for these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to speed up the process involving children, officials have introduced new rules which will require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, depending on the shilling workers.
Many will appear through a video telephony conference, instead of personally, to bring arguments in favour of their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those considered ineligible for aid will be exported immediately.
According to the strander workers and the reports that emerged from the system in recent months, the more the children are kept under custody, the more likely they become anxious or sad, which could lead to their violent expression or attempt to escape.
The lawyers said that these concerns would increase in a larger facility such as Turnillelo, where signs of a child being found/found difficult are more likely to be ignored, given the size of the facility.
They added that the movement of children to the town of tents without being given enough time to prepare emotionally or without claiming strength to their partners could lead to a trauma that many of them are already fighting.
Syria tells the US, France and Turkey "incumbent forces" to withdraw immediately
While addressing the UN General Assembly, the Walid al-Moulem Minister for Foreign Affairs also asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Muualem, who also served as a prime minister and deputy, said that the foreign forces were illegally on the Syrian territory, with the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be properly addressed."
"They shall withdraw immediately and without any condition," he said to the assembly.
Muualem insisted that the "war against terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where since 2011, more than 360,000 people have died, with millions more being moved from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue "to fight this sacred battle until we have been expelled from all Syrian territories" both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, many of which train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in the land in the country destroyed by the war.
With regard to the refugee issue, Muualem said that the conditions were right for them to return, and added "in some Western countries" for "transitional terrors" which led refugees to stay far away.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are rationalizing what must be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel of Idlib created an opportunity to continue the political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale attack by Syrian forces supported by the Russians on the province, where three million people live.
However, Muualem stressed that the agreement had "light deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military action will target the fighters including the fighters from the Al-Qaida Front, who "will be destroyed".
The UN dispatch Staff de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be restricted to “review of the articles of the current constitution”, and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Second Mandate
With this logic, Mr Trump will win the re-election in 2020 as long as, as many free viewers are hoping, the denunciation and the scandal end his presidency early.
What would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic finale that has ever been in a presidency!"
So far, it appears that the viewers have not yet heard.
Since 2014, time ratings with the largest number of viewers have increased more than double to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in time with the largest number of viewers, more than 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC's "Rachel Madow Show" increased cable television ratings with even 3.5 million viewers in key news nights.
"This is a situation that attracts people because it's not something we understand," said Neil Baer, presenter of the ABC drama programme "Designed Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, writer of the Veteran compatriots and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths Aout Sneaing Into the White Boys," has another theory.
He is a member of the ‘Lugansk People's Republic’ of the ‘Lugansk People's Republic’.
The driver told her that he would vote Mr. Trump.
She asked questions.
"He said, "Why didn't you force me," said Mrs. Scovell.
In this caus there is a value of entertainment.
No doubt, unlike anything else on TV, the titles of the stories that come out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if the immigrant families can reunite and the strength of the global economy.
To ignore what is happening around you is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself in the sixth following a panel of experts discussing the use by Bob Woodward of "deep background" sources to his book "Fear," the bomb with the skin of hunger ("Washington Post reflecting pride", said Paul Manafort's "Washington Post") with a value of $15,000 and the implications of the descriptions of Mr. Trump's anthonym by Storm Daniel.
I, for example, will never again look at Super Mario in the same way.
"A part of what you do to make it as real as this is that every night it is leading you something," said Brent Montgomery, executive chief of Wehelhouse Internment and creator of "Pun Stars", about the changing cast and the development in the daily plot of the Trump programme (fighting with N.F.L., commends Kim Jong-un).
You cannot afford to lose one episode because you otherwise fall back.
When I contacted Mr Flliss this week, outside his home weather was suns with 80 degrees in the northern coast of Kawai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while recording the CNN.
He could not stand in front of the television, not when there was a Brett Kavanwag ready to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
"I remember when we used to do those exciting programmes and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of the Western civilisation," said Mr Flliss.
"I thought it was a joke, but in truth they were right."

Large amounts of money coming from abroad to the most stringent racing in the White House mid-term election
It is not surprising that the 17 congressional districts of Pennsylvania are seeing a large amount of money, thanks to the re-allocation of the congruative districts which have acquired two operators in a race for the same seat.
This recently re-established the pets of the Suburban District of Pittsburgh the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is issuing as a candidate against another operator, the Republic of Keith Rothus, which currently represents the 12 old districts of Pennsylvania, which extends widely over the 17 new districts.
The maps were re-established after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were set up in an anticonstitutional manner in favour of the Republics.
The race in the 17 new districts promoted a difficult competition of the financial campaign between the weapons of finance of the main party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a family name in Pennsylvania after winning with a slight difference in the March special election followed very closely for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That seat was a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the 20-point district.
Political criticisms gave the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States has decided to punish El Salvador for its support to China, then decided not to do so
The diplomas noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little help from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump held a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and held a hotel in Panama until some partners expelled the administrative team of the Trump Organisation.
The State Department officials decided to contact the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the "most recent decisions to stop recognising Taiwan", said the speakers of the Heather Naurer department, in a declaration at the beginning of this month.
But the penalties were only taken into account against El Salvador, which in 2017 received around $140 million in US aid, including narcotic controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be burdensome for the Central American country and its high unemployment and death rates.
As internal meetings started to progress, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year that was considered as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with a view to effectively ending any penalty considerations for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been strongly criticised to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance of the administration sitting at the meeting, saying the diplomas.
And the three American senders returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or punishment from Washington.
Speaker of White House, Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were supported by a foreign analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
History study
The next unexpected negative event could be the report of the special consultant Robert Mueller on possible disruption of justice by Mr Trump, on which there is now very substantial evidence in the public register.
He reported that Mr Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was agreed with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In the event that the Congress passes on to another person, Mr Trump will find himself responsible in that body, as he prepares to go back to the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
This involves a lot of uncertainties, and I do not aim to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – nor that of its equivalent in Europe.
There are options from which all of them are to be made on both sides of the Atlantic which will affect the extent to which the fight is prolonged.
In 1938, German officials were willing to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, which would have succeeded in the West and supported Czechoslovakian in Munich.
We have not succeeded, and we have lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such inflection points, and the inestimable course of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Today Americans face many of these inflection points.
What will we do if Mr Trump removes Deputy Attorney General Rod Roshenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this document reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be recorded in secret and calculated that it would not be suitable for office.
Mr Roshanstein said that the report of The Times is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the F.B.I.'s new Bret Kavanaugh's investigation is incomplete or unjust – or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual behaviour and dishonest testimony?
And above all, in half the terms we will vote for Congress that will keep Mr. Trump responsible?
If we do not pass these tests, it will last for a change in democracy.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was exiled to Auschewitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the house of my ambassadors.
She managed to live, evacuated to America and, 60 years later, on the day of worship of the God who sent me to blow the candles on that swastika table.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Ringers is found optimistic before the competitive game with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against Austria, after the impressive equal outcome they brought in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League G Group.
A knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Durrans from making his first appearance of the season to the equal result of 2-2 with Villarreal but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a catalyst for big things.
"This was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old male.
"We came to the game with the belief that we could get something and get it out with a point.
We were probably able to win it to the last but, in all, an equal outcome was probably a fair result.
Probably they were better in the first half of the game while we walked better in the second half.
Thursday will be again a big European night.
We hope that we can get three points but this will be difficult because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd after us, I am sure we can continue to do our best and get a positive result.
The past year has certainly been difficult, between all that has happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but despite this there is currently a sense of optimism.
The team is good and the boys are very happy; the training is doing well.
I hope we can now do our best, forget our last season and succeed."
Women are concerned about this fear related to retirement savings
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking to their family members about this.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to be a family member to remember, but they are not taking the steps to make a conversation," said Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
You should start this way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide treatment if you do not express your wishes well before time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you will receive treatment, as those options can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Get your financial consultant: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a life insurance policy with a hybrid value of money to help cover these costs or make self-insurer with your own good - provided you have money.
Take a decision after discussion of your long-term legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Find a healthcare professional to choose a reliable individual to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
In addition, consider a proxy for your finances.
Choose a person who trusts to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you are ineligible.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"Not only the finances that are involved, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
See that that plan is ready."
A man was hit several times by an air-twisted trap in Iifracombe
A man was hit several times by an aerial bomb shoot as he was walking home after a night out.
The victim, aged 40 years, was in the Oxford Grove area of IIfarcombe, Devon, where he was hit by a shoot in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "a random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries do not threaten his life and the police have called for witnesses.
Terremoti and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, said officials, with the number of deaths expected to increase.
In addition, the Commission considers that the aid granted to the beneficiary of the aid is compatible with the internal market and that the aid is compatible with the internal market and does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.
In Palau, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
These are some of the main facts about Palu and Donggala, about the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawesi, located at the edge of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit the city, it was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a reasoning extending over over 300 km (180 miles) of the coast in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The resistance, an administrative region under the province, had a population of around 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and farming are the pillars of the economy of the Central Province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mine is also important in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Moroi, on the coast of the other side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been affected several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Doonggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Ring of Fire of the Socialist Pacific and is often hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a large earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh province of Indonesia on the top of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumtra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Terremot with a strength of 6.8 hit the southern part of Java, which is Indonesia's most populous island, which triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: Terremot with a force of 7.6 hits near the city of Padang, the capital of the western province of Soumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: Terremot with a strength of 7.5 hits from the islands of Mentawai, beyond Sumatra, which triggered a 10-metre tsunami which destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Low earthquake struck the resistance of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, which caused destruction and panic as people remembered the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time no tsunamis were exhausted, but more than 100 were killed because of spreading buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the top of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of temporary isolated tourists.
The largest Boy of Sarah Palin Arrested on Domestic Violence Accused
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and the presidential vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of attack.
Palin, aged 29, from Huilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfered with a report of domestic violence and arrested, according to a report issued on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when attempted female adolescents called on the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her hand.
Palin is being held in the Mt-Su Pretrial Facility and is held on an unguaranteed bond of $5000, reported by the KTU.
He appeared the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "surely, not guilty" when he was asked to give his motive, reported the network.
Palin is facing three Class A crimes, i.e. he may be imprisoned for up to one year and have to pay a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B offence, which is punishable by a day of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges against Palin have been made.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veteran Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, involved in the domestic violence crime report, and held an army in possession of him while he was a fugitive in connection with the incident.
His girl alleged that she had hit the bridge in her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by the veterinary groups after a comparison between the violent behaviour of her child and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Terremot and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after a earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with a strength of 7.5 tsunamis and thousands of homes have been destroyed.
Electricity and communication networks are not working with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just a few miles outside the centre of Sulawesi located in the north-east of the capital city of Indonesia, Jaffar.
The media are circulating videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a holiday on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore with great force.
Federal prosecutors are requesting that a suspected NYC terrorist attack be given a rare death penalty
The federal prosecutors in New York are asking Sayfullo Saipov to be suspected of the terrorist attack of the city of New York killing eight people in the death penalty - a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state for a federal offence since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, allegedly used a rental truck of Home Depot to carry out a road attack for bicycles along the West Side Highway in Lwer Manhattan, by flying to walking persons and cyclists who ran on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to the announcement of an intention to demand the death penalty, presented in the South District of New York.
According to the court document, these two heads of charge carry a possible death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed Saipov 22 indictments, including eight murder charges with the aid of organised retremation, typically used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
When describing the manner in which Saipov carried out this attack "suffering, cruel and immoral", the prosecutors said that the attack needed "substantial pre-planning and meditation."
The notice of intent states that "Sayfullo Habibulavic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Celves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Earl Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alyandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the South District of New York last made a death penalty.
Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time that the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being found guilty of a conspiracy to conduct a funeral for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were killed by the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a national of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of recurrences in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt well about what he did, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing SIS videos on his mobile phone, in accordance with the head of the indictment.
He also asked to put in his hospital room a flag of ISIS, said the police.
He replied not guilty to the 22nd head of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who was representing Saipov, said that they were "assuredly disappointed" by the prosecution decision.
"We think that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a motive for a prison sentence with no possibility of freedom will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," said Patton.
The Saipov defence team has previously asked the prosecutors not to request the death penalty.
MP Tory says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Negel Farage promised to "mobilise the army of the people" .
The former Ukip's former head said that the politicians had to "feel under pressure" by the Europeans – as suggested by one of Thessa May's own MPs that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
The member of the government of the Conservative Party Peter Bone told the demonstration in Birmingham that so far the United Kingdom would have "come out" if Mr Farage had been Secretary of the Brexit.
But the challenge facing Ms May to reconcile its very shared positions was highlighted by Torres, who was not in favour of Brexit, who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister finds it difficult to keep her Chequeers' compromise plan on track among the attacks by the Brexitaires, those against Brexit and the EU.
The athletes insisted that despite the negative reaction it would continue to move forward to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – and force the Europeans and the Labour party to choose between its package and "caos".
Mr Bone told the rally Leave Mains Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "dismiss the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been given a high social position and be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would have been released so far," he said.
The MP Wellingborough added: "I'm going to save Brexit but we need to abandon the Chequers plan."
When he declared that he was against the EU, he said: "We have not fought world wars to serve us.
We want to do our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and must remain absolutely unreal."
Andrea Jenkyns, a Brexitaire of Tory, was also present for the demonstration, where she said to the journalists: "I want to simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequiers' plan is not popular with the general public, the Opposition will not vote for it, not popular with our party and with our activists who are actually the ones who go on the streets and who vote first for us.
Please forget the Chequors plan and start hearing."
In a message aimed at Ms May, she said: "The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that the politicians should "feel under pressure" that they would go back to the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us -- people -- and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to go back from the Brixit and we are here today to tell them that "we will not allow you to go astray if you do this."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he said: "I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is at the point of going back from Brixit.
We are mobilising the army of the people of this country that has brought us success and will not spend until we have become an independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those against Brexit walked in Birmingham before doing a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
Following the launch of this weekend group, a small number of activists traveled banders in the writing of Torres Against Brexit (Tories Against Prexit).
Lord Adonis, who has a high social position in the Labour Party, has taken a stand in front of the Conservatives for security issues which suffered with party apps as the conference opened.
"These are people who tell us that they can have all the IT systems in place and technology for Canada and more, for the free border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a complete rat.
The idea of a good Brexit does not exist," he added.
Warren intends to "examine carefully" the possibility of issuing for the presidential election
The United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, "it will carefully examine the possibility of issuing for the presidential election".
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the member of the Massacustus Democratic Party spoke about its future in a debate with citizens at municipal level in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, who is frequently critical of President Donald Trump, will come out for a re-election in November against the State Representative GOP Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was at the centre of speculation that you could replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with the constituents who have been using the format of a debate with citizens at municipal level since Trump took office.
A person attending the meeting asked if she had intended to issue for the presidential election.
Warren replied that it was time that "that women go to Washington to repair our fragmented government, and this includes a woman at the top."
He was arrested in connection with the killing with the shooting of LSU Sims.
On Saturday, the police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that he was suspected of being arrested in connection with the murder with the shooting of the LSU's Wayde Sims basketball player that took place Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at 11 a.m. ET News Conference.
Friday they issued a shooting video, asking for help to identify the man shown in the video.
Sims, who was 20 years old, was killed with a flight near the campus of the Southern University this morning.
According to 247sports, Saturday the chief of the Morphy J. Paul said to the media "Wayde Sims suffered an injury caused by flying in a head and eventually died as a result."
Wayde came to defend his friend and was hit by a flight from Simpson.
Simpson had questions and admitted that he was on the scene, who had a weapon, and admitted to shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and held in custody in the Eastern Parish Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims, a young man who had six pages and who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds every game.
The Grand Prix of Russia: Luis Hamilton approaches to get the world title after the orders of his team gave him the victory in relation to Sebastian Vettel
Saturday, from the moment Valtteri Battos qualified before Louis Hamilton, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would have an important part in the race.
On the inside side of the first row, Battos had a good advantage and almost abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his friend.
Vettel was the first to enter the stopping areas and left Hamilton to hang with the others in the last place of the group, something to be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in the stop-up area after another turn and left immediately after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to walk after a little bicycle action which led the Ferries driver to leave the inside of the free because of the risk of falling back after a double shift to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the rear row of the grid and was in the seventh place until the end of the first turn in the closing years and at the age of 21.
It was then at the forefront of most of the race by not changing its tyres with a view to completing rapidly and exceeding Kimi Raqonen for the fourth place.
He eventually entered the stop zone in 44 turns but could not increase his pace in the eight remaining turns while Raqonen entered the fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valteri did a very good job throughout the weekend and was a gentlom of truth said let me by.
The team did very exceptional work to get the first and second place," said Hamilton.
That Was Physically Bad
President Donald Trump dropped for the desk to Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday in connection with her instability that she did not seek the letter from Christine Blasey Ford that she was accusing the designated person of Supreme Court Britt Kavanwagh of sexual assault.
Speaking in rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly inform the witness given by Ford before the Senate of the Judicial Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "violable and disgruntled and not honest."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and violent and dejected and not sincere," he said.
"When you look at statements and disclose information and then say, 'No, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, have you stolen any information?
Remember her answer... clicked the document - "e, e, what is it?
No, you don't.
I didn't miss anything."
See, wait a minute.
We revealed... No, we did not," added he, while imitating the Senate.
Feinstein you sent her the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was revealed earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the disclosure was coming from her office.
"I didn't hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I didn't miss her story," said Feinstein to the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But it seems that her rejection was not well received by the president, who, during Saturday evening rally commented: "You know what we know, that was quite physically wrong.
It may not have been, but what is the worst physical injury I've ever seen."
In his defence of the designated Supreme Court, which was accused of misconduct by three people, the president suggested that the Democrats were using allegations for their purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You're seeing the vitality, disgruntling, they don't care about those who hurt them, those who make the sticks in the wheels to gain power and control," said the president according to reports from Media.

Air Traffic Supervisor Dead to Ensure That Hundreds of People On Airplane Can escape the Terremot
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered to be a hero after his death to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people manage to land safely.
More than 800 people died and many were lost after a great earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which triggered tsunamis.
The area was still under control and many were caught in a debris in the city of Palu.
However, although his colleagues fled to rescue, 21-year-old Anthonyus Gutanan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower he was like at Palu Airport, Mutira Sis Al Jufri Airport.
It remained calm to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which at that time was on the runway, could have left safely.
He then exceeded the traffic control torches when he thought it was changing.
He died later in the hospital.
Speakers for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision likely saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News of Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in California to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we let this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"When we hear about it we feel a great deal of sleep," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency states that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is estimated that the number is still increasing because many bodies were still under the throttle while many could not reach it," said the speaker of the Sutopo Pureo Nugroho agency.
The waves that reached up to six metres destroyed Palu in which Sunday will become a mass denarius.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance enters the body.
Clean water is scarce.
Min-markets are being stolen everywhere."
Jan Gilfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Cross Red of Indonesia is working hard to help those who are still alive but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
The President of Indonesia Joko Widodo arrived in Palu Sunday and said to the military of the country: "I am asking you all to work night and day to complete every task related to evacuation.
Lest?" reported the CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Incident of an aircraft in Micronesia: Air Niujini now says that a man is lost after the aircraft incident in the lake
The airline operating a flying flight in the Pacific lake in Myronesia now says that a man is missing, after having previously said that the 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated by the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement that from Saturday afternoon, she was unable to give details about where one male passenger was.
The airline stated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save passengers and other crew members after the aircraft hit the water when trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday the officials said that seven of the people were taken to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of which were in stable condition.
What caused the incident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the US Naval Fleet both said that the land plane in the lake was a little away from the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane exceeded the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane entered very low.
"This is a really good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to pass through the water which was high up to their feet until the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said that the flight assistants were running and shouting, and that he suffered from a minor injury in his head.
The U.S. Naval Fleet said that seafarers working closely to improve moll also helped rescue by using an opening boat to carry passengers to the shore before the plane was stolen at about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Date from Aviation Safety Network indicates that in the last two decades 111 people have died in incidents of airlines registered with PNG but no incident involved Air Niugini.
Analist presents a time schedule for the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution concluded its evidence on the case in the new process of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi while she was alive in 2014.
The analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rolllett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the mobile records to gather information about 29-year-old Quinton Tellis defendant movements and the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19-year-old, on the night she died.
According to RoWlett, he received localisation data from several mobile phones which showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicts his previous statements, reported The Clarion Leder.
When the phone date showed that he was with Chambers at the time he said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and testified that at that time he was not in the city.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said that night was in the truck of Sanford, Sanford said that he was "being lying, since my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis said that he had known Chambars for two weeks when she died.
The mobile records indicated that they knew each other only a week.
Roult said that some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted the messages, calls and contact information of Chambers from his mobile phone.
"He deleted her from his life," said Hale.
The defence is scheduled to start its closing arguments Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the process to pass to the jury later that day.

Another black person?!
Nany from NY scratches a couple for removing it after a "rapist" message
Nany from New York is training a couple for discriminatory expulsion after she received an erroneous message from the mother who was complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny to be racist, and compare the case with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed regret when she learned that the new person taking care of the children, Giselle Maurice, was a dark trailer when she arrived on the first working day in 2016.
"LEEEEEEE OTHER SYWDA PERSONA," wrote Ms Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her man.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Mrs Maurice, twice.
Having noticed her grave mistake, Plasco-Flaxman felt "success" and dismissed Ms Maurice, who said that her predecessor, who was African-American, had not done well and that instead she was waiting for Philippines, according to New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for one of her working days and was then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is threatening the couple for compensation in respect of dismissal, and is seeking compensation of $350 per day for the six-month live-in position for which she was initially employed, although without a contract.
I want to show them, listen, you can't do such things," she said to Post Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple attacked the racist declarations, saying that the expulsion of Ms Maurice was the most reasonable thing they could do, fearing that they could not trust her after they had defended her.
"My wife sent her something that she did not intend to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco to Post.
"But if you trust your children in someone who spoke with a goff, even if it was erroneously?
Your newborn?
And come."
When comparing the case with "extortion", Plasco said that only two months had passed since his wife had the baby and was "in a very difficult situation".
"You will accuse someone like that?
It's not a beautiful thing to do," added the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly announced to the couple about the social media, where they were consulted for their conduct and logic.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not relate to others who spoke.
The girl of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone reading it for the first time before it was published.
"It is very interesting that we now know what we know about Paddington's great success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the book of children by a small game source, would certainly have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "pleasant but confused a little with grief" after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she described as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was proud of his eventual success although he would never have talked about it.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't full of himself," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like when you had a child to get something: be proud for them even if it wasn't you who got something.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success that way.
Although he was his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
Minnie was dying and I had to give her last wish on the phone.
As soon as her daughter was born, her daughter was taken to Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where the doctors worked to save her life but was all for nothing.
"Nad was calling regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, that she wasn't expected to live," said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a call from Nad to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to give her the last wish.
And so I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I will be with you soon.
Be with you.
The medicines that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were decreasing and leaving her system slowly.
She had died some time before and started to break everything.
All I could do was sit down and wait, aware that all of this is happening.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry by turning around with families and people.
I had to hold back really."
Ms Ednan-Laperouse, who was so far crying for her daughter’s loss, eventually boarded the plane together with the other passengers – who did not know of the difficult situation it was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had a low head, and the tears began to drop all the time.
I found it difficult to explain, but there was on the flight that I felt a great sense of sympathy towards Nad.
That he needed my love and that we would go away.
I knew how much he loved her."
Place of cards of missing women to avoid suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one because of suicide are working to prevent others from removing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Hammhreys were tying cards on the Welsh bridge with inspiration messages and telephone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, Mrs Davis' son, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew for his smile.
They always said that his smile would turn up every room."
However, he had to quit work before he died, because it was found "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Brother Tyler, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found his brother after he had killed himself.
Ms Davis said, "I am always afraid that this will be the cause of another terrible event."
Ms Davis created the cards, "to inform people that there are people with whom you can open your heart or meet them, even if as a friend.
Don't put it in silence - you need to talk."
Ms Hammhreys, who has been a friend of Ms Davies, has lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not too after his mother's death.
"He didn't say that he was feeling bad or depressed or so," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day was very bad - when the children opened their gifts did not make any contact with them with his eyes or something like that."
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they want to force it: "Let empty into the family.
It will separate us.
But we all want to continue living and fighting."

The future of Bret Kavanaugh is in a precarious situation as the FBI initiates an investigation
"I said, that if we could get something like what he asked - a limited investigation in time, limited in purpose - maybe we would bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would be "discovering" among the partisan paralyses who grew roots.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their relevance is fully due to the choice of time.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November – if, as expected, the Republicans do not go well, in that case they will be severely weakened in their attempts to put the man they want to be elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was taking the phone to call the Senates, to try to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What will happen after the FBI presents its report?
Voting will take place in the Senate, currently occupying 51 Republican and 49 Democrat positions.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, Vice-President, to vote and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea "low" under Kim
The number of North Korea deserters for South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, said South Korea legislator.
When quoting data from the ministry for the unification of the South Sea, Park Byeong-seug said that last year there were 1,127 change in the party – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates requested by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comments.
The vast majority of North Sea deserters will be offered citizenship of South Korea.
Seol says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most of them escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross compared to the Militaryised Area (DMZ) heavily protected between the two parts of Korea.
China considers the deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their country by force.
North-South relations – which are technically still in war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the timing of the denuclearisation negotiations.
This took place after the June historic meeting between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards the Korean nuclear-free peninsula.
But Saturday, North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho committed to the United States sanctions for the lack of progress made since then.
"without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, in no way will we be the first to unilaterally remove weapons," said Mr Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosis calls Brett Kavanaugh "isterical," saying he is unable to work at the Supreme Court
The leader of a minority of the Chamber Nancy Pelosis called the person nominated for the Supreme Court Mr Brett Kavanaugh "isterical" and said that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because of his contemporary behaviour.
Pelosis made these comments at a Saturday interview in Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't have thought of the fact that if a woman had ever acted that way, they would have said "isterical," said Pelosis about her reaction to Kavanwagh's testimony before the Justice Committee of the Thursday Senate.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were still young.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and laughing when he was talking about his family and his secondary school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "assistance of the Grutiska and coordinated character" organised by the liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the Presidential election in 2016.
Pelosis said that she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think that he qualifies himself with those declarations and the way that he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosis moved when a question was asked whether she tried to accuse Kavanaugh if it was confirmed, and whether the Democrats obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say something -- if he is not telling the truth to the Congress or the FBI, therefore he is not able, not only to be in the Supreme Court, but even to be in the court he is currently in," said Pelosis.
At present Kavanaugh is a judge at the Court of Appeal of D.C.
Pelosis added that as Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would change certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not right that a person with mysterious prejudice goes to the court and expects to say, "very good," said Pelosis.
And women need to exercise their Authority.
It is a fair verbal attack, months and years filled with anger, and she cannot say what she should say without crying.
"We cry when we grow up," said the sunset Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's a rare thing, what it says?"
She added, "It gave me a lot of a woman who was stuck in some other place, who said that even she was crying when she was angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she was raising up and starting to cry, she told the person she was talking to, "It's probably thinking that she was upset because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then he did not stop.
And I thought it was something brilliant."
The crying is allowed as a way to partly exhume its large anger because they are fundamentally misconcepted.
One of my most clear memories of one of the first jobs I had, in an office dominated by men, where I once found myself crying in an indescribable rage, was when a older woman I was before me from the bunch of necks - a bright manager I always feared a few of them - and carried me to the shelter.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know that you're angry.
They think that you are depressed and feel happy that they have succeeded in hurting you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Democratic Congress by Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was going out for the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in a relationship outside of marriage on a boat known as Money Business and came out of the election, Ms. Schroeder, very angry, concluded that there was no reason why she did not explore the idea of itself for the presidential election.
"This was not a well-intended decision," she said to me with tears 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who were going out for the election, and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and 7 Nani."
Since this was at the end of the campaign, she was back in raising funds, and therefore lost that she would not go out for election if she did not make $2 million.
There was a battle lost.
She discovered that some of her supporters who were giving $1,000 to her men only gave her $250.
"Do they think that I take some discount?" said she.
When she made her speech in which she had announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so emotional - grateful to the people who supported her, angry with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and to target voters instead of delegates, and angry at sex - which she had lost.
"I probably thought I had such strong brakes," reminded Ms. Schroeder of the way the media responded to it.
"I thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my grave?
"She cried"?
How the US-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The number of air bombs opening the United States-China trade war would have left behind, while the battle still had to end, a lack of agreement between countries could be beneficial for long-term Beijing, say experts.
Donald Trump, US President, gave the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exporters including solar panels, iron and aluminium.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting goods amounting to $200 billion (€150 billion), and effectively taxing all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has been registered at the same time, while more recently it was presenting fees of up to ten per cent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has pledged to agree with the United States every time, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy of the world will go ahead in the near future.
The fact that Washington makes a step back means accepting requests, but publicly the fact that China has admitted to the US will be too embarrassing for some Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing works wisely, the pressures of the US trade war can support China in a long-term positive way by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that start economic nightmares in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what the viewers previously acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia at the Centre for New American Security, which is a reflection group.
Syria is located "complete" that refugees return, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the Unity Nations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees in the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the start of the war in 2011 more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country.
Another six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian regime welcomes help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the hearing.
Europe embraces the victory of Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the Reader Cup 2018 against Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times in a European land and have not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again won the title when the team of Danish master Thomas Bjhorn reached 14.5 points that it needed to win the US.
Philip Mickelson who is prominent in the United States, who fought throughout the all-tourment, gave his pulp in the water at 16 par-3 holes, and thus gave up his game to Francesco Mollinari.
The Italian Gallfer Mollinari boasted in all of its rounds, and it became 1 out of 4 players who have ever brought 5-0-0 since the current timing format began in 1979.
Americans Jordan Spieteh lost 5&4 against the player at least level on the European team, Thorbjour Olesen of Denmark.
The player of the highest level of the world, Dustin Johnson, brought 2 and 1 to Ian Poller of England who played at his final Rider Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Caps, Spanish Sergio García, became the best European tour player ever in the world with 25.5 points along his career.
"I don't usually cry but today I couldn't hold.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy, very happy that I got back the cup.
The team is everything, and I'm glad I could help," said García emotional after the European victory.
He passes the tortoise to his compatriots John Ram who won the U.S. Gulf Legends 2&1 in Stingles play Sunday.
"The incredible pride that I feel, which I won to Tiger Woods, when I grew up to follow it," said Rahm 23 years old.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of Ryder Cup 13-21-3 throughout his career.
A strange statistics of one of the best players ever here, who won 14 main titles, the second after Jack Nicklaus alone.
Team USA has fought all the weekend to find those parts of the golf course with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high calibre golf during the entire timing.
The U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his team, "I am proud of these men, they fight.
There was a time in the morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We made a statement.
To Thomas we take the chapel.
He is a very good master.
His 12 players played very well.
We will be reunited, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
To these 12 young men I love them and I am proud that I am a master.
You have to grab the hat and wash your head.
Play better than it."
