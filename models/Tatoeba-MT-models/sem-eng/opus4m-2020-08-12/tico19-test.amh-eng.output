How long have these signs been in existence?
And all chest pains should be treated in this way, especially when you are your age
and has a fever
And cholesterol blood pressure should also be examined
And do you now have a fever?
Do you now have this condition of the chest?
And you also have respiratory problems
And what other symptoms do you have?
And how high was your fever?
and Greet me
and a moderate cold and cough

And I feel that I have a little fever
And I want them to explain to me where it is.
And they have a certain fever
And you have a history of diabetes.
and I feel as if my chest were falling
And people know that they always take an interest in me
And at this time, you are experiencing chest pain
And they say that this is pressure within you
There are people in your family who have heart problems, heart disease, heart attack, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure
Have any other symptoms or problems encountered in connection with muscle weakness?
Are there patients with similar symptoms at home?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Should you have any shortness of breath?
You’re still having chest pains.
Because this is a time of disaster
But we should not put the pain of heart aside

But I have breathing problems
But many people knew that they were interested in me
But we must take great care to treat each condition of the chest
But is it not a good time to breathe?
In all, I have forgotten about this condition of the chest
It’s a feeling that you’re getting too close to someone
Still Feels a Shortness of breath

The same is true with fever and headaches and muscle cramps
Upright in My Heart
Show me in this picture what you feel like
About Your Fever
So do you think that some of these symptoms are related to pregnancy?
So, are their children showing the same signs?
Tell Me About Your Limits
In the evening, the fever increases
My fever for the past two days
The temperature is rising yesterday night
This is the porter of the Trajan Center, in the emergency room
Can they tell me a little more about your condition?
I feel a pain in my chest here on my first body before
So I had severe chest pains

What kind of sickness do you have?
When did this condition of the chest begin?
At Which Place Are You Sick?
With whom do you feel this condition of the chest
You Have a Sense of Adherence on Your Limits
They don’t know I have diabetes and that kind of thing
They said you have this condition of the chest
By the time of January 1-March 15, 2020, the overall level of caseload of the coronary virus (COVID-19) was growing rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU).
The overall incidence of coronary virus (COVID-19) is showing similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Revolution and in the United Kingdom, which, although at various levels, confirms that the COVID-19 epidemic is spreading rapidly throughout all countries.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and high-level surveillance departments must increase their readiness, expecting that the number of COVID-19 patients in need of health care and particularly high-risk care will greatly increase.
December 31/2019, the unknown cause of pneumonia cases was reported in the state of Water, Hawaii, China.
Janwari 9/2020, China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, reported that it is the source of the gene Novel Coronavirus, known as Sardram Coronavirus 2 (SAR-Kov-2).
Since then, Servic-CoV-2 has been described as a coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence now shows that 80 % of COVID-19 patients have a moderate disease — a respiratory infection with a pneumonia or a pneumonia; most also recover.
In 14% of cancer cases, COVID-19 needs to be treated more seriously in a hospital, while the rest of the cases face serious medical needs.
It is estimated that about 4% of patients who sleep in a hospital because of COVID-19 died.
In this study, COVID-19 compares the overall trend of the European Union/European Economic Survey and the United Kingdom (UK) with the government of Hubei in China.
We have now compared the number of COVID-19 cases in the European Union/European Economic Area and the number of cases in Turkey with that in Italy until January 31 – March 15, 2020.
European Union/European Economic Survey countries and COVID-19 cases in Yuki
COVID-19 is next from China to more geographic regions, and the COVID-19 epidemic is now following the country in the world.
March 11, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 is a global epidemic.
March 5, which wrote in Eurosurveilance 2020, reported on the COVID-19 cases, which confirmed the first European case on the basis of the WHO Keith definition.
In the European Union/European Economic Area, France reported on the first three confirmed cases of January 24/2020, and the people were also from Water, Hawaii, China.
Until March 15, 2020, there were COVID-19 cases in all 30 countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths recorded from December 31/2020 to that date, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Identifying the total number and event of COVID-19 cases
The COVID - 19 cases reported in the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have been found only in each country of the world by the Ministry of Health/houses, national and regional health authorities, and WHO, to be improved every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data have been used by COVID-19 to measure trends in the European Union/European Economic Survey and in Turkey and to compare it with Italy.
Because of the presence of the COVID-19 cases, we have calculated the overall 14-day occurrence of the COVID-19 cases, and on this basis we have taken into account the natural course that existed in every European Union/European Economic Survey and in U.S.A.
We also compared the number of cases filed in each country by March 15, 2020 8:00 in the morning with January 31, 2020 in Italy.
COVID-19 Economic countries of the European Union/European Economic Survey and trends in Yuki
COVID-19 cases followed the overall trend of the European Union/European Economic Survey in 14 days and the U.S. (image 1) of the U.S. state of Hubei (China).
For the European Union/IA and for Lukea as a whole, the overall event of COVID-19 began about 21 February, and from then to February 28/2020, there was a dramatic increase.
This was largely the result of a rapid increase in cases reported by Italy, but other European Union/European Economic Survey countries and Yuké have shown similar growth trends in the combined COVID-19 event.
Figure 2 of the COVID-19 cases compares the total number of European Union/European Economic Survey countries and the total number in the United Kingdom in Italy to 31-March 15, 2020.
By 8:00 a.m., 15 other European Union/European Economic Survey countries and Yuké listed the total number of cases compared to Italy 3 weeks before or less than March.
As our results show, the number of COVID-19 cases reported has increased rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Survey and in Yuké.
The global epidemic, which is marked by trends in the overall COVID-19 event, is increasing at a rate close to that of all countries.
This is taking place at different levels in countries, as there are differences in national health responses and, perhaps, in various countries, there are different definitions and protocols for patients to examine the existence of COVID-19.
At the beginning of 2020, 10 percent of COVID-19 patients were infected in the Italian provinces, and, as reported by the Midianese sources, they were able to accommodate hospitals and high-level surveillance departments in these provinces.
Information on COVID-19 cases in hospital and/or intensive care is now available only for 6% and 1% (no aid).
However, to strengthen timely surveillance, which focuses on reports and the number of deaths, they need to be systematically collected.
A 2010–11 survey showed that there was a wide difference between the high-level surveillance beds in Europe and the regular beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 per 100,000 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less fervor than Italy (12.5 high- and middle-level care and beds for 100,000 people, in 2010–11).
More than 90 threats to the health-supporting environment of the modellin are presented in the EU/EEAA and Yuka hostloads of coded caseloads on the sixth ECDC calendar of speeds in the Kovid-19.
The European Union/European Economic Community (EU) countries and Yuké also have group cases and hospitals and high-level surveillance departments, often providing services for certain segments of society, cases and high-level beds of medical care, which should be made public on the status of status 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and other trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 epidemic is rapidly spreading in the European Union/European Economic Union and in Turkey.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and high medical care should be prepared to know that sars-kow-2 are increasingly prevalent in the community and that health care, especially high-level medical care, is needed to increase the number of COVID-19 patients; it is an example in the affected regions of Italy.
As pointed out in the recent ECDC's rapid threat balance, rapid and general approach to the SAR-COV-2 distribution is crucial. It should be changed to a reduction in the risk of the disease, since the expected rapid increase in the number of cases that has not been completed has not given decision-makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand their response, accept and adapt to the situation.
The rapid spread of threats limits social and health measures, which are designed to reduce the impact of the pandemic.
A short window is where countries are likely to step up their control efforts to reduce the health-care burden of the SAR-Kow-2 spread by delaying it.
Otherwise, the health-care systems of other European Union/European Economic Survey countries will be flooded with patients who want to be open and treated within the next few days or weeks.
Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) was caused by a serious respiratory syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (Sars-Kov-2), which still attacks more than 80,000 people in China and the rest of the world, killing more than 3,000 people.
A similar species of sars-cove virus in 2003 can be transmitted from bats by sars-cove-2 and can lead to similar signs.
However, while COVID-19 has a lower weight and a lower mortality rate, it also affects more men than young people and older men than women.
Since writing is increasing rapidly, the publication of the new disease is trying to make a timely and comprehensive analysis of the fast-growing research project.
We cover the basic issues of epidemiology, anthropology, biology, Lyta, medicine and prevention.
Although many questions still need to be answered, we hope that this strategy will help to understand and eliminate the disease that is threatening to cause harm.
January 25, 2020, was a memorable and memorable memory for all Chinese at the spring festival because they were reminded that the Chinese were not to leave their homes during and after the holiday because of a new viral disease.
The virus is the same as that produced by a severe respiratory syndrome in 2003; therefore, February 11/2020 was named Sars-Kov-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO), and the patient was named Kov disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in China, and it quickly spread throughout the country to some 50 countries of the world.
By March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 people had been infected with the COVID-19 virus, more than 40,000 patients had left the hospital, and more than 3,000 had died.
According to the WHO, COVID-19 is "the number one public enemy" and has the potential to do more harm than terrorism.
On the basis of the PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/publicmed/), the first report was published in less than two months since the issue of January 7, 2020, in a series of biology, epidemiology, etiology, pathology, disease management and medicine, including more than 200 books on COVID-19, which set out the order of viruses isolated from various patients.
This scenario seeks to summarize the progress they have examined in a new and rapidly changing article.
As far as possible, we try to compare COVID-19 species and other cov-id diseases, with the syndrome of the central Eastern respiratory tract (Mers, 2012 epidemic).
What we have learned so far about the prevention of the disease and the history of the disease, as well as some of the remaining urgent questions.
CoVs are commonly called pathogens that do not cause death to man, and they are the main causes of about 15% of the cold.
However, in this century we have faced two major disease-induced COVs (Sars-Kov and Mers-Kov); first in 2003 and 2012 in Saudi Arabia, China and then in 2012, they have rapidly spread to many other countries a number of alarming diseases and deaths.
Therefore, the timely COVID-19 is the third plague of COV, recorded in human history.
As illustrated in image 1, the first reported report of the National Commission of Health from water to China was December 31/2019, whose origin was unknown.
Seven days later, Koov's followers were released.
January 15, 2020, the first death was recorded in the water.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, sub-states and countries.
On January 20, health-care providers were reported to have been infected with the virus, which was a sign of transmission of the virus from person to person.
On January 23, all public transport in the capital was stopped and the city's entire activity was closed down.
The first clinical study of the disease, conducted in January 24, revealed that only 21 of the 41 patients in whom Kess was confirmed had direct contact with the marine food market, which was thought to be the source of the infection.
On January 30, the WHO announced that the epidemic was an urgent global health threat.
At the time of this report, the disease had spread in China and nearly 50 other countries (image 2).
Because the situation is changing rapidly, the final size and weight of the epidemic will still be determined.
February 11, 2020, was conducted in a multicentre study of 8,866 patients, of whom 4,021 were confirmed patients of COVID-19 showed the recent state of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.q.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPa1qHA2bhdA).
Sars-Kov-2 affects people of all ages, but it mainly affects 30-65 years of age.
Half of the individuals infected (47.7%) are over 50 years of age, and very few are under 20; only 14 are under 10 years of age.
The number of men attacked by Sars-Kov-2 is greater than the number of women (0.31/1000,000).
COVID-19 was mainly widespread in and around Hawaii.
It takes an average of 5 (2-9) days to be diagnosed from the day of the inspection of COVID-19.
An average of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) begins to show signs of a person infected with the virus.
The average time was 9.5 (4.8-13) long, from the beginning of the disease to death.
The basic fertility count (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
Before January 23, 2020, the number of people infected with the virus increased dramatically — the time of transportation in connection with the Chinese spring festival.
There were 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main concerns of COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a large and package of viruses with a single RNA program.
They can be divided into four categories: Alpha, Beth, Gamma, and Delta; among these, Alpha and Beth KoVs are known to attack people.
Envelope spik (S) glycoprotin is made from the cell-receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptide peptices 4 (DPP4) of the sars-CoV and mer-CoV and then of the combination.
The viral RNA is released into cytoplasms, where they create a body inside or outside of the cell that is free from the virus by combining it with the plasma tissue.
The first order of Sars-Kov-2 was determined on January 10, 2020.
When Sars-Kov-2 was identified as a new type of beta-CoV, more than 99.98 % of the 10 samples taken from the seafood market from the first of the first of the epidemic were found.
The sars-cove-2 gene is more like the mars-CoV than the sars-CoV.
On average, the sars-cove-2 microscopes in the human respiratory tract have been found in very small parts.
Man's ACE2 has been received by Sars-Kov-2 and by Sars-CoV.
However, the S protein in the Sars-Kov-2 has been weakened by the fact that sar-CoV is less severe than sar-Cov-2 in humans, which is related to the fact that sar-coV is less severe than sar-Cov-2 infection in patients.
Sars-Kov-2 is a short novel protein that is prepared by an orf3b and is released by an orf8 protein.
The SAR-Kov-2 orf3b virus can interfere with the detection of IFNβ and can play a role in its ability to cause it; however, there is no known or known practical reason for it to do so.
On 18/2020, Zou and his teams reported that the full length of the Creo EM structure was 2.9 Å resolution, from the amino acid transport B0AT1 complex.
Complex with open and closed guarantees has been regrouped as a dimmer, and ACE2-B0AT1comlex has shown that it can bind two S proteins, which is evidence of CV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may be a cure for sars-cove-2 infections.
A Source and Distributor
Sars-CoV and Mers-CoV have been found to be the source of nightbirds and to be the source of their transmissions, followed by vultures and camels.
Sars-Kov-2 was thought to be the first host of the species by night birds in comparison with other CoVs because the new virus was 96% similar to the two bats of the species BAT-SL-CoVZX21 and BAT-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the average carrier who had the virus cross the ethnic border and attacked people has not yet been identified, and the route is still being explained.
According to G and his rooms, he transmitted the virus from bats to humans, which called for realignment with S proteins.
According to one study, researchers in Guanjo, China, punglins, who have long noses and eat ants, are often the middle hosts of the sar-cove-2, which is based on a 99% racial similarity found between COV and Sars-Kov-2.
However, the distribution of 1% difference in both Genomes is itself a major difference, so concrete results are being expected for concrete evidence (M.33).
The physical and chemical properties of SAR-Kov-2 are not yet widely known.
Sars-CoV and Mers-CoV remain in the dry area for up to 48 hours and so below 20 °C and 40%-50% on moisture and 5 days on moisture.
Sars-Kov-2 may have similar qualities.
Sars-Kov-2 is reported to be at 56 °C to 30 °C: Ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated bacterium, phesytic acid, chloroform and other sulphides, not including chloroxide, can completely weaken the virus.
The general population is vulnerable to the new virus because of its weak resistance to sar-cove-2.
Currently, no detailed research has been reported on the response to the external virus for Sars-Kov-2.
Thus, we can only launch studies on other coves, especially on the Sars-Kov and Mers-Kov (image 4).
In general, after a virus invaded the host, it was first known through the PRRs, which included C-Lectin-right recipients, TLRs, NRDs, and RIG-I-RLRs.
By using various lines, the virus stimulates the spread of the virus by using the growth of the body’s organs, the development of antigens, the type of I-interferonosis (IFNs), and by limiting the spread of the virus.
However, the SAR-CoV N protein can help him to escape the disease prevention system.
Recently, the immune response to the disease has been a little mixed up in the fight against the virus.
CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes, including T-lymphocytes, play a key role in preventing the disease.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce an antibiotic virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the virus-affected cells.
T-cells produce pro-inflimatory cytokines to help the immune cells.
However, COV can hinder T-cell action by accelerating T-cell death.
Fluid antibodies, such as C3a, C5a and Antibodis, are also crucial for preventing viral infections.
For example, a patient who is different from a recovering patient has been rendered useless by Antibodis Mers-CoV.
On the other hand, when the immune system reacts excessively, it produces high levels of free radicals, causing serious damage to the lungs and other parts of the body, and, even worse, it can result in death, leaving different parts of the body out of work.
The risk of sar-cove-2 infection is higher for the elderly and pregnant women with various diseases.
It is common for those who are exposed to high - risk viruses or who are weak in their immune system to be infected with the virus more often than others.
The average of SARC-2 is approximately 1-14 days, most of which is 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in the water.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that on average it was 3 days and from 0 to 24 days.
As noted above, the most recent study, based on public scientific information, showed that 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) of the virus were due.
It is vital that health authorities adjust effective rooming times based on the most accurate breeding times, and that when they do so, they prevent people who do not show signs from passing the virus on to others.
Since it is common to be broken down, individuals who are exposed to or infected with the virus are often required to remain in a specific storage area for 14 days.
Should there be 24 days of specific detention?
The primary and first signs of COVID-19 are fever, which can be accompanied by symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, headaches, sore throat, stomach pain, nausea, and confusion.
Some patients had experienced a reduction in oxygen levels from the day the disease occurred and/or in the blood.
With strong cases, patients begin to show severe respiratory syndromes, septic shockes, metabolic acidosis, and cogulopati soon.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory disease and severe fever should be tested for the early detection of the virus, even though they have no problem with the pneumonia.
A publical study carried out at the end of December 2019 revealed that the contents of the disease were 98% for fever, 76% for dry salinity, 55% for shortness of breath and 3% for storage; 8% for patients needed respiratory support.
Similar findings have been recorded in recent studies of a virus - infected collection carried out by two family groups and one that did not show signs of illness.
Relatively, according to a 2012 public health study, fever (98%), dry sal (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) are major signs.
However, 80% of COVID-19 patients needed a more breathing machine than COVID-19, considering that Mars is more lethal than COVID-19.
Sweating (26%) and sore throat (21%) were observed in patients with mersitis.
In sars patients, fever (99%-100%), dry sal (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40-42%), vomiting (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were major subjects; 14%-20% of patients also needed respiratory assistance.
On February 14, the level of COVID-19 was 2%, and the number of international cases was 66,576.
Relatively, as of November 2002, there were 10% of the confirmed cases of death from sars among the 8,096 cases.
According to a population survey conducted in Le Mers, June 2012, there were 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases of death.
A survey conducted in the early part of the period revealed that the SAR-COV-2 R0 to 6.47 was as high as 95% of the security interval (CI) was 5.71-7.23; the SAR-COV R0 was also 2-4.
Sars-Kov-2 is presented in a 1.1-table, based on the signs of death and R0 based on the signs of Mars-CoV and SARA-CoV.
The above figures indicate that sars-cove-2 is more widely distributed than mars-CoV and sars-CoV, but that its ability to kill is less than that of both.
Thus, controlling the SARC-KOV-2 epidemic is more challenging than controlling Mers-CoV and SAR-CoV.
The group infection occurs frequently in the same family or group or in a motor vehicle as a recreational ship.
In the two weeks prior to the event, patients had a direct contact with individuals or patients who were living in water or other areas affected by the virus.
However, reporting that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without showing signs and that patients who have recovered from the hospital may still carry the virus again is a warning to prolong the withdrawal period.
In the early chapters of the disease, patients have a number of regular or smaller white blood cells (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphophilia with white blood cell count: 4x109/l; lymphocyte count added; 1x109/l with elevated aminotransferase size and viraemia 1,099 patients in the Covid-19 patients.
In some patients, blood levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin have increased, while C-reactive proteins and erythrocyte sedimentation have increased in most patients.
In patients with severe keez, the level of D-dimer in the blood is increasing, and the number of white blood cells in the blood is gradually reduced.
In most of the COVID-19 patients, the results of chest radiographs reveal a health problem, both of which are either sided by sneezing or by the presence of soft rooms in the lungs.
Patients often have regular pneumonia, severe pneumonia, and severe respiratory pressure (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation of the body, storage of fluids, and growing wounds cause serious problems with gas exchange.
By reducing the stress of lipi and protein binding, type-I and type-II alveoli cells increase the stress of lungs and the risk of pneumonia.
Therefore, the worst findings of breast radiography are often related to a much worse level of disease.
February 18/2020, the first analysis of COVID-19 disease revealed the damage of neoseptics, the formation of helin cells, the formation of pneumonia in the lungs, and the presence of dead pneumonia cells, similar to those of sars and mercess patients, who are at risk with viral infection and ARDS.
The presence of sars-kov-2 RNA, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), served as a critical criterion for COVID-19 disease.
However, because of the rise in the negativist output and the rapid spread of the epidemic, on February 13, 2020, clinical evidence was used to detect disease in China (not only on RT-PCR).
There had been a few similar cases in the diagnosis of sars disease.
Therefore, history of disease, clinical evidence, laboratory tests, and radiologic findings is crucial for effective disease management.
February 14-2020, Feng Zhang group CRISPR-tokor SHARLOCK Technique put in place a protocol to test sars-cove-2, which in less than an hour without an additional device is used to detect the synthetic sars-cove-2 RNA at 20 × 10 - 18 mol/L to 200 × 10 - 18 mol/L (10 - 100 kupier microlitres)
We hope that if the new technique can be verified for clinical samples, it will be able to greatly increase the wealth and comfort of the clinical sample.
Because of a lack of training related to Novel CoV, doctors are mainly able to provide COVID-19 with supportive care, and they also try various previously used or planned therapies (table 2).
These include antiviral drugs, immune agents, steroids, plasma taken from patients, Chinese medicines and psychological support, and future treatments.
And the thought was that plasma should be used to treat patients that had been recovered from the disease.
Farmarutic companies are in a hurry to produce vaccines for the virus.
In the first place, Sars-Kov-2 is the primary target of lungs, and ACE2 is the least active component of other organs, such as the digestive system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory disorders and interruptions are a major threat to patients and a major cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support to reduce the symptoms and save lives is crucial: the overall oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invertible Ventilation, and mechanical Ventilation include the weight of the fruit.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be assisted by extracorporal cell oxygen (ECMO) — an improved heart and lungs technique to treat a life-threatening heart or respiratory function.
Also, electronic balance, secondary infection, and septic shock prevention and treatment, as well as control of organs, are crucial for SAR-Kov-2 patients.
The cause of cytokine stram is known to be excessive in the immune system of sars and mercerists.
The description of a sytokine stram response to artificial implantation is the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFN, and MCP-1, including the release of TNFα, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, INN, and MCP-1.
These cytotoxins release a high number of free radicals, which cause ARDs and various parts of the body to stop working.
Imyonosuppression cytokine stromas is crucial, especially for patients with chronic disease.
Cortisteroids and Tosiliszumab, who are monoclonal antibode, have been used to treat histamine stram.
Other treatments for cytokine stratography include a response to T-cell-oriented disease; the prohibition of IFN-≤, IL-1, and TNF; the obstruction of JAK; Blainatomomab; the prognosis of cytokin 4; and HDAC's inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used to reduce harm to people’s immune system.
However, high-level steroids are of little help in reducing serious pneumonia in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Rather, it can have a profound impact on the development of the disease, leading to its death, with its serious side effects, especially bone cells.
However, short-term corticosteroids to COVID-19 patients have been advised to give them proper treatment.
When this text was written, it was not yet confirmed that there was an effective antiviral therapy.
However, Remedsivir, a nucleoside analogue, has shown a positive effect on the COVID-19 patient, an American who has been given blood transfusions.
Remedecivir was a new antiviral drug produced by Gilead, first designed to treat diseases that occurred with the viruses of Ibola and Marburg.
Later, Ramdesvir showed that he had hindered single RNA virus activity, including Mers and Sars viruses.
Based on this, Gilead has given the matter to China and has been able to join forces against individuals who were victims of SAR-Kov-2; the results are expected with great anticipation.
Also, Barristinb, Interferon-α, Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Rivavirin were intended to be used as therapy for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Insomnia, nausea, strife, liver injury and other adverse reactions may occur due to a combination of lopinavir/Ritonavir therapies.
The link between these and other medicinal products used should be carefully monitored.
Producing plasma and Antibode From Recovery Patients
Similarly, there is a long history of blood transfusion from those who have been infected with the disease in order to treat people who are infected or to prevent healthy individuals from getting infected.
Of course, patients recovering from the disease have a high level of antibiotics compared to the pathogen in their blood.
Anbodis is a B-lymphocyte (Ig) and fights against pathogens and other foreign substances, as well as special molecules in pathogens that are directly out of use.
Accordingly, plasma was taken from the blood of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected to 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms were improved within 24 hours, and blood oxygen intake was improved by reducing the blood pressure and virus.
However, until a number of therapies are prepared, assurance and lighting are needed for a wide range of services.
In addition, taking into account the effects of disease reduction, some plasma-related damage must be carefully considered.
For example, by looking at the response to disease prevention, Antibodis can also cause the toxic effects of cytoky’s syndrome.
Antibodes in the blood is often low, and the plasma desire to treat patients who are persistent is high.
The rapid preparation and production of certain antibodises that are capable of fighting a global epidemic is difficult.
Therefore, it is necessary to isolate the B cells from the recoverable patients and to identify or select genetic codes that are vital to producing effective antibiotics.
In this way, we can easily grow the antibodis production.
TCM has been used for thousands of years to treat various diseases in China.
However, their effects are mainly based on a combination of different parts of a single equation, which varies according to the sensitivity of the TCM.
It continued to be unknown or vague to most of the most effective parts, because it was difficult to identify and confirm such parts or mergers.
Today, because of the lack of effective and specific therapies for COVID-19, TCM is one of the main options for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients with chronic disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du Kins and Lian Hua Qing Win Kins have been successful in COVID-19 treatment.
In many of China's 87% TCM-using states, cures for COVID-19 patients were high. Of these, Gnsu (63.7%), Ninzia (50%), and Juan (50%) included: 30 % of COVID-19 patients used TCM, and the lower Hubei province (13%).
However, this comparison is shallow, since many other influences, such as the number of patients and the level of disease, have to be balanced by the Creator.
On 18/2020, Boli Zhang and his employers published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) alone with WM and TCM combined medicine.
The time he wanted to recover, the time he lost, and the time he spent sleeping in the hospital, he confirmed that he had to be significantly reduced in the WM+TCM group rather than in the WM alone group.
Amazingly, there was a sharp decline in the level of disease (from mild to severe) in the WM+TCM group rather than in the WM+TCM group (7.4% to 46.2% compared to); and the level of death was much lower than in the WM+TCM group (8.8% to 39%).
However, the more efficient and secure TCM is, the more controlled it is, the more likely it is to be.
It may also be interesting to describe the procedures and explain the efficacy of TCM treatments or, if possible, their combination.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are terrified of a highly contagious and possibly deadly disease, and people in specific detentions feel bored, lonely, and angry.
The negative effects of infections and treatments, such as fever, shortness of breath and cough, can also lead to more mental disorder and mental depression, such as Carticosteroid sleep disorders.
At the early stages of the Surgeon epidemic, various mental health problems were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, mental aches, mental symptoms, convulsions, and suicidal thoughts.
One of the most effective social health responses to the COVID 19 epidemics is that people who are identified as the victims of the epidemic, the effects of the epidemic, and the isolation of their families and friends may feel troubled and guilty.
Therefore, COVID has to provide mental health care for 19 patients, suspects, and people in general who have contact with them.
The most important aspect of psychological support is the establishment of many mental health groups, the clear transmission of regular and timely information about the Sares-CoV-2 epidemic and medical plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to prevent the creation of one another.
In addition to effective vaccines to cross the distribution chain from animal warehouses and people caught to predators, they are an anti-viral aid to control epidemics caused by new viruses.
In view of the sar-CoV, efforts have been made to produce S-protein research vaccines to permanently strengthen the immune system.
Vaccines for disease-induced viruses have been tested in animal models for the shark.
However, these proposed vaccines should be determined before a competent clinical study has been initiated with regard to animal-borne models and viruses that reduce the effect and death rates on the elderly.
There has been no new case ever since, since the shark was reduced by 17 years ago.
In contrast, in the Middle East, Mars Kess continued to spread widely, spreading from animal to human transmission to other regions.
Non-active viruses, DNA plasmas, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like agents, and Labaratori-generative protein sub-units have been developed for Mers' vaccination strategies, some of which have been tested on animal models.
A safe and effective vaccine for people with no immune system is an urgent and vital step in controlling the epidemic in progress.
However, the long time needed to produce vaccines (on average 18 months) and the changing nature of COVs is a challenge.
Because COVID-19 is a new disease, it is just beginning to show the full clinical process of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without damaging their health.
However, as with Sarce and Mers, COVID-19 causes severe pain and death to the most severely ill.
Therefore, it is crucial that health-career genes develop a model for the development of this disease so that they can arrange their services, especially in areas where there is a shortage of nurses.
Based on clinical studies so far reported, the following issues may affect or relate to the history of COVID-19 patients (table 33):
Age: Sears were crucial to the history of disease, and this was done for COVID-19.
According to the above, according to a survey of 8,866 cases, 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age had a major incidence of COVID-19 in the 30-65 age group.
The fact that patients who need high medical care have had permanent diseases and health problems and are without permanent health problems (based on the average age of 66 to 51) suggests that age is a quality that can help patients to estimate their chance of recovery for COVID-19.
Gender: As mentioned above, Sars-CoV-2 is the most vulnerable of women (0.31/100,000 men, 0.27/100,000 women).
COVID-19 patients who require intensive medical attention are more likely to suffer from serious heart disease and respiratory problems.
Problems related to heart disease are at the root of the death toll.
Cars-CoV-2 is reported to be bound to ACE2-positive colangiocytes, which can cause liver problems in the 19 patients.
It is important to note that age and chronic illness are highly linked and that they can interfere with each other.
Poor labyrinth findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) seen in the blood reflects the level of tumor or sensitisation, the ability to determine the natural history of disease, the response to therapies, and the final recovery process.
The relationship between CRP size and COVID-19 and the forecast of growth has also come to a fore.
Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatinine kinase (CK) can also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are seen in various parts of the body, especially in the heart and liver, and are released when tissue damage occurs.
Therefore, heart or liver health disorders are a regular part of life.
The main clinical symptoms: chest radiography and clinical signs must be combined with other issues in order to predict the results and health problems of COVID 19.
The use of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are commonly used as an aid therapy to reduce respiratory damage to infectious diseases.
Because of the widespread use of corticosteroids on patients with severe disease, many survivors experienced the death of bone cells, permanent disability, and low standard of living.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used on a small and short-term basis for the COVID-19 patients.
Mental distress: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from severe anxiety and uncertainty because of seeing close family members and other patients die.
In order to help these patients recover from anxiety and return to normal life, psychological advice and sustained support are essential.
On the basis of public studies, the COVID-19 has a different distribution situation than the shark.
In addition to multiplying himself on the lower respiratory line, sars-CoV-2 multiplys itself on the upper respiratory line and does not show any light or sign on the first chapter of the infection, which is similar to other CoVs that cause a cold.
Therefore, because people infected with the virus can produce a large amount of virus from their daily roots during the first phase or in part, it can be very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, Sars-CoV has been shown to be the worst in patients and that most of the early stages of the disease have not been spread.
Thus, the current COVID-19 epidemic is more serious and more difficult to control than the disease of the vessel.
Major efforts are under way in China to stop the spread of sar-CoV-2 in China, including the total restriction of activity in water and surrounding cities and the conditions for keeping the general population in a state of isolation.
These measures are seriously affecting the economy and other aspects of the country, but the decline in the number of new patients suggests a reduction in the epidemic.
The most widely distributed estimate is that the epidemic ends in March and the volume of distribution is reduced by less than 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not as extensive.
According to Paul Hunter, COVID-19, which seems to be more contagious than a ruin, did not end in 2020.
And Ira Longini set up a model to predict the consequences of the epidemic, indicating that Sars-Kov-2 could attack two thirds of the world's population.
According to a Canadian team, sar-cove-2 samples taken from the nasal and throat of patients who recovered 2 weeks ago were found, which also indicates that the newly known virus may occur more frequently, like flu.
However, there have been promising signs in China of the decline in the number of new cases, which shows that the current strategies may not be effective.
It was first estimated that Ibola would cause half a million deaths by recording up to one million cases.
However, the disease is under control because of strict lying and isolation.
Like species-CoV, sars-CoV-2 can weaken its strength, die from a process, or live with people and have a weak capacity to cause disease.
The comparison between the COVID-19 epidemic and the sarce and Mars is below (image (image.55).
Sar-CoV-2 is highly transmitted by means of direct contact with infected substances by means of boils or suffocation.
The virus was also found on the beams, indicating that it had a chance to pass from the country to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases found that 41% of cases, perhaps caused by an infection that existed in one location, included 17 patients and 40 health-care providers.
Therefore, to protect people, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and patients or those affected by the disease, careful care must be taken.
The first line of defense we can use to reduce the threat of infection is the front mask, which helps to control the spread of the virus by operating the surgical masks and the N95-respirator masks (production number 1860s).
Surgeoning masks prevent droplets from the infected person from flying or from being attached to the floor of the material and from being transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (difference number 1860s) can contain between 10 and 80 nm in size; only 5% of the small viruses can be fully vented into the breath; they are slightly similar to the Sea-CoV-2, both of which are estimated to be 85 nm.
Five types of surgery are combined, but small items can be inserted, health care providers who have direct contact with patients should not have N95 (production number 1860s) and surgeons.
To reduce contact with the virus, health-care providers must wear a self-adhesive goon.
And viruses can corrupt a man through the eye.
Janwari 22, 2020, a Dr. N95 was infected with sar-CoV-2 with masks. The virus may have spread through his eyes and entered his body.
Therefore, health-care providers have to wear face coverings or shoulders that clearly show how they work with patients.
To the general public in affected or affected areas, everyone is advised to wash their hands with soap, stay in a private home and limit contact with people who are likely to be infected with the virus.
A man's distance from a sick man is three feet.
These are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Despite the fact that Sars-CoV-2 has become a new virus to the world of mankind, as reported in January 7, 2020, China’s high similarity with Sars-Kov was due to China’s major earthquake in 2003.
However, the director of the Water Control Centre, who comforted the people on January 19, 2020, said that the new virus is less likely to pass from person to person and that it is not difficult to prevent and control the disease.
Especially as the whole country was preparing for the spring festival, this message had significantly reduced the public’s awareness, and the disease had lost a crucial time in controlling water at a low level.
Disease control agencies in China can take this difficult lesson and do hard work for the future.
For example, they should be more careful when they give public statements because (1) citizens give weight to each word and can change their views and decisions; (2) doctors or seniors need to be more cautious and responsive to unusual information from a clinic; (3) they need to be more reluctant to prevent an epidemic from taking place on his own; and (4) the people need to spend more time searching for and improving the community’s response to epidemics in order to increase their awareness and understanding of epidemics.
The COVID-19 epidemic, caused by Novel Coron and the species-CoV-2 virus, began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China, and it has spread to some 50 countries during the preparation of this text.
Because the virus is so similar to the sars-cove virus and because of the similar signs of COVID-19 and sars, the occurrence of the COVID-19 epidemic has created a sense of reoccuracy.
However, there are some significant differences between the COVID-19 and the vessel, which are crucial for controlling the epidemic and treating the patients.
COVID-19 affects older people, more men than women, and the weight and death rate of the disease also increases among older people than young people.
The degree of death caused by the shark is greater than COVID-19 (10.91% than 1.44% compared).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus without signs, but CAVID-19 patients often transmit the virus when they are seriously ill, making it difficult to control the COVID-19 transmission over the vessel.
This explains why Sar-CoV-2 of Sar-CoV is rapidly and widely distributed.
The regular screening of the RNA for Sars-CoV-2 may be Negative in some patients of COVID-19.
On the other hand, survivors may again be positive.
These findings greatly increase the risk of viral transmission.
Since research on COVID-19 is progressing rapidly, a number of key issues need to be addressed:
Where did the Sars-Kov-2 come from?
Although there is a 96% cross-sectional similarity between the sarse-CoV-2 and the two nightbirds CoVs, we cannot yet conclude that the sarse-CoV-2 comes from the nightbirds.
What kind of reptile was it that carried the virus from the first carrier to the person of the bat?
We don't know how to stop spreading, and the epidemic can come back at any time.
Although sars-CoV-2 has been associated with ACE2, how does the virus enter the airway cells and cause disease?
Is the virus linked to ACE2 in other parts of the body?
Without clear answers to these questions, we will not be able to achieve rapid and accurate disease management and effective treatment.
How long does the plague last?
How does the virus show growth in humans?
Could it be a global epidemic, would it be like a shark, or would it be like a cold?
While it is crucial to seek answers to many of the above and other questions, it may take some time.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and to return to our normal lives.
The Origin of Human Coron and Vaccines
The burden of change and adaptation has been the source of thousands of deaths, including gonadovirus and human beings.
Before 2003, two echkovs have been shown to cause mild colds.
The serious respiratory disease (SARS) and the MERS epidemic have proved to be a threat to and destroy the immune system.
By the end of 2019, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China had restored focus and, to our surprise, his ability to transmit highly was reduced compared with the parallel SARS-CoV.
It is of great benefit to us to understand the sources of Hitchkov, since it is a fetal disease.
Many of the HCoVs come from bats, and they are not the cause of disease.
Some of the Czechs are known as the main bearers.
The identification of pregnant animals is directly related to the prevention of diseases.
An examination of coov - carrying trades in animals can give us a valuable insight into the cause of Kove’s disease in humans.
In this assessment, we provide a summary of the information about the seven Hhkovochs, the history they have found, as well as the history of major sources and the transmission of genetics.
We compare the need to regroup the virus from the virus start and the genome to the different ones of the Echkov.
The current Cov disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is described in this field.
In addition, the burden of disease has been marked by the criteria for successful changes in the body's body weight, as well as by the scientific and biological implications of the virus.
Corona virus is classified as a virus group called Coronavirde; it is a covered group; positive, and a single-renate virus.
These viruses contain the largest genome virus of the RNA virus, ranging from 26 to 32 km and are named "Kovch" because they look like a crown under their architecture.
There are some undivided genetics that share the same kind of incision.
An estimated two thirds of the virus's species contain two large open readings (ORF1a and ORF1b), and many proteins are converted to pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyprotins continue to create 16 non-structural proteins, different Nsp1~16.
The rest of the class have a Spanish (S), an ivylope (E), membrane (M) and nucleotoid (N) structure, and the ORFs.
Many changing protein trunks are registered with different species of Kovech.
The protein is divided into four categories (alpha-cove, beta-cove, gamma-cove and delta-cove), of which beta-cove is a lot of chocoves (A, B, C and D).
The evidence of the seed shows that bats and mice are the main reservoirs of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs, mostly as well as those of alpha-CoVs.
For thousands of years, Kovech has repeatedly crossed the border of the seed country, and so some of the crucial causes of his disease.
There are seven of us who are still known as Kovkovich.
Among these are Hitchkov-229I and Hchkov-Niel63, Alfa-Kov.
Other five contain Hchkov-Ossy, Hchkov-Hchkeu, severe respiratory cornovirus (Sars-Kov), Middle East respiratory cornovirus (Mers-Kov) and Sars-Kov-2.
Hchkov-229I, Hchkov-Ossy43, Hchkov-Hchkeu1 and Hchkov-Niel63 often produce symptoms such as common colds and/or mild-swelling.
On the other hand, sars-kow, mars-kow, and recently different sars-kow-2 are the most common causes of disease, resulting in severe respiratory failure (ARDS) and extrapolatory symptoms for many patients in the lower respiratory area.
The first HHKOV-229E, model B814, was separated from the nasal fluid of the infected patients in the mid- 1960s.
Since then, there has been a great deal of knowledge in Hchkov-229I and Hhkov-OSI43, both of which have been studied for signs of self-absorbing.
Of course, it has been widely accepted that HIV infection does not cause harm in general until the outbreak of your disease.
The Saars epidemic of 2003 has caused many dangers in recent history: over 8,000 people have been attacked, 10% of them in the worst - case scenario.
Ten years later, the epidemic of respiratory disease (mers) in the Middle East had spread rapidly to another continent.
The 2019 Novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), which has been renamed Sars-Kov-2, has caused a series of epidemics of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which has attacked more than 91,000 people and has brought more than 3,120 people to the fore by March 3 of 2020.
Because the alarm bell is being called, it must be prepared for the plague of Sars-Kov-2, which is to come without coming.
The seven echkovs are from the bats, rats, or pets.
Many information supports the fact that all chocovos originate from the nightbird, although this virus is well adapted and is not a cause of disease, there are major racial differences.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a major health, scientific, social and moral threat to China and the world.
A study of the Kovech source gives us the theme of nature's history, the unsettling pressure behind it, and what limits the distribution of seeds.
This can lead or facilitate the search for future SARS-CoV-2 main, medium and breeding animal(s) in preventing the future spread of SARS-CoV-2.
We are looking at the origins of this contact with Zonotk, the distribution between races, and the overall cause of Hitchkov’s disease.
Especially: the more we discuss and highlight the unrelationable Hitchkov virus theme, the weaker it is in their natural storage space, but the more they get, the more diseased they become.
We also evaluate the attitude of the increased transmission rate, which is often accompanied by a reduction in the incidence of disease.
The results of the continued spread of SARC-COV-2 have also been explained in this field.
The animal code has been known since the late 1930s.
Before the nasal holes of patients infected with B814 were first identified, HHC-229I cell has been identified from various vulnerable animals, including trophies, mice, cows, cats, cats and dogs.
Over the past ten years, seven Hchkovochs have been found.
The theme of Hitchkov’s discovery is set out in a clear order in table 1.
The first echkov-229E episode in the upper respiratory area was observed in 1966, followed by the growth of the sneezing cell lines in WI-38.
Hechkov-229E victims, including headaches, sneezing, nausea, and sore throats, have seen fever and cough in up to 10 ~20 % of cases.
Later, in 1967, the spread of chokov-occupation was removed in the series of breast-fed rats and brains.
The clinical characteristics of echkov-Ossy43 are similar to those of infections caused by other respiratory diseases, such as flu viruses and rhinoviruses, which cannot be distinguished from those caused by Hchkov-229I.
Both HHKOV-229E and HHKOV-OC43 are widely distributed without delay; so in winter, when cold, they are widely distributed.
All in all, the time that these two viruses appear is less than one week, followed by two weeks of illness.
According to a survey of good volunteers, healthy individuals affected by HCoV-229E have developed a lower cold.
Patients whose immune capacity is very low have a severe lower respiratory disease.
Sars is also known as the “non-regular sanctuary” and is the third in human history as the Hitchov-shabia epidemic, the ethical cause of which is the sars-cove.
The first discovery of Sars is remembered as being in Guangdong Province, China, in the end of 2002.
The Saars epidemic has spread across many countries and continents, killing 8,096 victims with 774 deaths.
It is estimated that every case of rapid transmission will cause a two-tier increase in the number of cases, which will be on the 10th day after the disease has taken place, during the 4 to 7 days of breeding.
The early symptoms of sars-kow patients are milgia, headache, fever, feeling of nausea and cold, shortness of breath, cough and respiratory distress, and delayed signs.
Lymphopenia (a very low level of lymphocytes in the abdomen), poor liver tests, and elevated creatinine kinase (an enzyme that flows out of the damaged muscle) are common side effects of poor laboratory behaviours.
The spread of alvelar damage, the increase in peptidal cell, and the increase in macrophages have been seen in patients with sarse disease.
On average, 20-30% of the homeless need special care and breathing equipment.
In addition to the lower respiratory area, the liver and kidneys, including the gastrostatic environment, may be affected by this difficult situation, which is often compounded by a dangerous form of sytomy, particularly against patients with a weak immune system.
The first virus is against a relative of the patient who has gone from his companion to Hong Kong to have a separate lung surgery.
Since then, there has been a surge of energy in HKOV research.
By the end of 2004, Hitchkov-Niel63 had been taken from a 7-month baby in the Netherlands.
First of all, it has been found that childhood, adult and respiratory diseases are widespread among patients who are resistant to the disease.
Hitchkov-enel63 is a common nasal fluid, ain sac, fever, and bronchitis.
Another study revealed a similar virus from the 8-month sneezing nose of a baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although he is well known in the Netherlands, he is widespread throughout the world.
It is estimated that HHKOV-NL63, 4.7% of the common respiratory disease, is around 4.7%; the worst is in the winter, at the beginning of September.
Hachkov-Niel63, which is associated with the flogging of the throat, known as krupp.
In the same manner, Hchkov-Hitchkeu1 was a 71-year-old patient who had been taken away from HKK1 since he was hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-borne lung and throat disease, Hchkov-Hitchkeu1 was reported to have been associated with the exacerbation of high asthma.
Hhkov-ENL63, Hchkov-229I and Hchkov-OC43 have been found around the world, causing lower respiratory infections.
All of this has been done well in human beings, and overall, there is a short chance of producing highly pathogenic diseases, although for unknown reasons, it has been recorded that despite the dangers of sub-injurious heterosexual heterosexuality63, in China, recently caused a respiratory infection in the underside.
Overall, this HCoVch comes to be a small killer or causer of disease when they have the capacity to transmit highly and to maintain themselves in a row between people.
Mers-Kov, first discovered in Saudi Arabia in 2012, was a 60-year-old lung patient whose disease had been turned into a lung disease and whose kidney had stopped working.
Although most of the labyrinth-verified cases have come from the Middle East, the second most recent cases have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
The second distribution took place in South Korea in 2015 in France, and the number of people arrested is 186.
As the results of an examination show, Mers is like a shark that changes to a rising lung disease.
In contrast, many patients infected with mercenars have been created as an add-on to their kidney function, which makes Mars very different from the diseases that have so far been caused by Hitchkov.
More than 30% of patients suffer from stomach and intestine disorders, such as vomiting and vomiting.
Since February 14, 2020, more than 2500 Labratori-tested cases have been recorded: 34.4% of deaths, and this makes Mers-Kov one of the worst viruses for people.
In mid-December 2019, there were a number of pneumonia patients in the city of Hubei County, China, who had been in contact with the Sars-Kov-2 infection from the front to the end.
According to the International Health Organization (WHO), the disease has been called COVID-19, which has attracted the attention of the world community as a result of the spread of SAR-COV-2 lower respiratory tract.
Since March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases have been found worldwide, with 3.4% of deaths.
In Hawaii, China, the mortality rate for patients is 4.2%, and beyond that it is 1.2%.
Sars-Kov-2, such as Sars-Kov and Mers-Kov, causes dangerous respiratory infections, which are characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
They are seen in some patients, and in some patients they are seen.
The lungs are one of the most serious symptoms of the disease, and they can rapidly lead to an enlarged respiratory obstruction syndrome.
Although Sars-Kov and Sars-Kov-2 are very close by 82% because of their high nucleotide sequences, they are listed under various branches of the tree in its illicit root.
The Sars-Kov-2 is very contagious compared to the Sars-Kov and Mers-Kov, but it causes a minor disease.
The presence of unmarked SAR-Kov-2 victims has been recorded, and they are likely to contribute to the rapid spread of the disease around the world.
The need for comparison and comparison of the Sars-Kov-2 with the other six HKVs reveals significant similarities and differences.
First, there is a very similar time for echkovoc disease to develop and last.
Sars-Kov-2 follows the qualities of the six others.
The COVID-19 is located between the fear of or the weight of the disease in Sars-Kov and the four Hzkovich (Hzkovich-229E, Hchkov-OC43, Hchkov-HKU1 and Hzkovich-NL63).
On the other hand, the Sars-Kov-2 infection is characterized by a very large number of behaviors, including the undetermined, mid-, or unmarked, social-hecchochoch infection.
On the other hand, although the combination is somewhat different, the COVID-19 is like the cars-cove disease.
Third, the transmission of the Sars-Kov-2 shows impressive trends in socialism and Sars-Kov.
On the one hand, the Sars-Kov-2 distribution is at least as high as the Echkekov, which is spread by social media.
On the other hand, it is not yet established that Sars-Kov-2 will remain in the person and that his traffic capacity will decrease as much as the Sars-Kov and the Mers-Kov.
Sars-Kov-2 can finally be found in a cross-sectional sample.
The use of sar-cove-2 is an essential part of future studies, as is the sar-cove case.
There is a strong desire to see that H.K.K.'s cases are changing.
However, the spread of SAR-Kov-2 qualities, the cause of disease, and the persistence of the disease have been heavily influenced by the most recent spread of COVID-19, including the ongoing spread.
All four community-based HCoVs are well adapted to people.
In another view, it may be true that humans are well adapted to these four echkovos.
In other words, the two ancient Hchkovs could be the remnants of an international epidemic.
Hitchkov, who causes the most pain in the person, and Hchkov’s serious illness have been eliminated.
In order to make this happen, Hchkówch has been able to create a pool of learners that challenge the causes of sufficiently burdensome constraints in humans.
In this case, there is a great chance of getting fully acquainted with people when the Sarce-Kov-2 epidemic lasts a long time and attacks many people.
If it has been well trained, it will be difficult to distinguish between human transmission and other disease control measures.
For a number of years, four community-based Kovochs have repeatedly been reported in the state population, resulting in a common cold for those who are resistant to a birth disease.
These viruses do not want a major collection of animals.
On the other hand, sars-cove and mars-cove are not very common among the people; they cannot stop spreading.
They need to continue and thrive in their vectors, as well as the chance of the spread of doubting victims, especially through one or more middle and breeding carriers.
Sars-Kov-2 has characteristics similar to those of Sars-Kov/Mars-Kov and the four community-herding Hitchkovos.
At least for the time being, there is a high level of echkov, as is the case with the spread of social violence.
But he is more likely to cause a disease than a community-born Hitchkovoch, and is less likely to cause a disease than a carror-cove, or mer-cove.
It will be seen in the future if he is not fully accustomed to human behavior and is able to pass through human life without being a carrier or a transmissible animal.
Before we explain where Hčkov comes from, we do well to discuss the seasonal, natural, connected, and supportive divorces and expressions of his qualities.
If its ends are closely related to the former origins, then an animal is like a Hitchkov-transposition carrier.
The virus that is passed through is very congenial to the Son of Man, and is widely accepted.
In the same way as I am: the saver shall keep Hitchkov continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, sufferers are naturally infected and carried with the Hitchkov virus or the parent's virus.
On the other hand, if Hchkov entered in a new form before entering the person or in a married area, he or she would not be well equipped with a new carrier, and they are often the cause of the disease.
This carrier can serve as a zootic source of infection contamination and play a role in the rapid spread of the virus and transmits it to people to increase the level of infection.
Unless he has done so in some measure within this temporary carrier, Hitchkov can continue to be a disease that destroys the entire population.
On the contrary, HKOV can adapt to their average bearer and can also create long-term epidemics.
And this shall be the middleman, which shall bear the burden of the natural vessels.
Epidemiological talent has shown a history of contact with animals connected to the capital of the sars.
Unlike the entire population, the study indicated that animal merchants were more like anti-Sars-cove IgG.
Pugoma larvata and Rakón Shoes were found with viruses that are very similar to sars-cove, first in the wild market.
This was indirectly supported by the absence of any additional vessel after all the marketers had been removed.
But before you touch the animal market from outside or out of zoos, animals such as cats are listed as non-sar-coves, not as medium-satellite carriers.
The fact that 80 % of the different species of mammals, especially in the gullet market, have anti-sar-cove antibiotics cannot be isolated from the fact that different species of mammals transmit and exacerbate sar-cove.
These sars-coves are not a carrier.
The evidence of the seed shows that bats and mice are the main reservoirs of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs, mostly as well as those of alpha-CoVs.
These nightbirds are shown in the order of the anti-Sars-cove antibody and the Serr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 gene.
This and other nightbirds share with Sars-Kov 88-92% nucleoside sequences.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new theory of infectious diseases in bats.
Although many species have been found in bats, there is nothing different from a live virus except one WIV1 class.
People's angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (SII) is known to be in possession of sars-cove.
WIV1 is designed to use a sample of bats and people's S.C.E.S.
Amazingly, SARS patients have not been able to satisfy WIV1.
WIV1 represents 95% of the species of sars-cove that is the closest in the night to replace a nucleotogen.
Although the two viruses differ enormously from the homology, it is believed that overall WIV1 is not the direct source of the sars-cove virus and that bats are not the direct bearer of the sars-cove.
Mers-Kovn brings the virus to the same group as the Bat Kov-HKU4 and the Kov-HKU5 bat.
The nightbird's Cove-Hickey4 and Mers-Kov use a similar patient's DPP4.
Arena Polymerez, based on Erenene, is a mer-cove sequence that is in the corresponding line of descent to the Kovch House, which has been accused of being in Europe and in the soil.
So far, there is no living Mars-Kov bird in the wild.
Mers-Kov and his close relative Bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of the nucleotide sulphon.
So the nightbird may not be directly carrying the mars-cove.
On the other hand, studies carried out in the Middle East show that Arab camels, unlike the mares-kows, stand for an anti-antagonist body, which, if it were the middle of the spectrum, would mean that they are like camels in many African countries.
Live Mers-Kov, a virus similar to the one discovered in Sussau, is the most visible and transmitting camels that distinguish themselves from Arab nasal fluids.
In Labratori research, the experimental camels were generally treated with lower symptoms but with higher viral transmission.
The issue to be settled is that infected camels release the virus not only from the respiratory tract but also from the feces, which is the main way they release the virus from the bats.
However, the causes of Mares' disease, which have so far been questioned, are not visible on camels, and it is estimated that the transmission of the disease to the human person or unknown species and the emergence of the unknown species are due to Mers-Kov.
Sars-Kov-2 Carinopus Aphinus shares 96.2% of the nucleotide sulfate with the nightbirds13.
Like Sars-Kov and Mers-Kov, Sars-Kov-2 and RTG13, it is difficult to imagine the relationship.
This means that nightbirds may not be the closest carrier to the sars-cove-2, unless there are similar nightbirds in the future.
Perhaps, being pregnant and transmissible animals of the Sars-Kov-2, they were killed inside a seafood super-market, and many of the root causes of the COVID-19 related to this, which showed that they had not yet been transmitted from animals to humans.
Recent studies on metagenomics show that the least endangered pangolin (Manis Jevanica) mammals may be carrying an ancient beta-kov-2 contact with sars-coves.
These Novel Pangulin COV Genomes share 85-92% of the nucleotide equation with Sars-Kov-2.
However, at their level of nucleoside13, 90 % of yours is closely related to antrig13.
In the disease-resilient class, the sars-kov-2-like viruses include two sub-strains, one of which is closely associated with the RBD of 97.4% amino acid sequence.
Although in the first order of the salon, the genome is wide, it is obvious that it is in contrast with the Sares-Kov-2 and RatG13 RBDs.
A previous study of diseased pungents found a virus contiguous sample in the lungs, which is similar to the Sars-Kov-2.
This study has taken various assembly methods and preparations to create a total length of about 86.3% of the virus's pre-incidence genome.
We cannot deny that Pongolin can be a species of sar-cove-2.
However, there is no evidence that the Sars-Kov-2 and the Sares-Kov-2 sequence are now directly linked to the Sars-Kov-2 sequence.
In addition, the distance between the Sars-Kov-2 and the RTG13 is less than that between the Sars-Kov-2 and the Sans-Kov-2 and the Sans-Kov-2.
Nightbirds, pangolines and other mammals continue to be a permanent route of change in sars-cove-2.
However, high-Homology advances have been found in RBDs at your home, and it is associated with beta-coves, sars-cove-2 and RTG13, which are connected to the Sars-cove-2 and Pangolin Sars-Kov-2.
The high degree of similarity between the pangolin sars-kov-2 and the pangolin RBDs (adhesives at the end of the attachment) between the beta-kow and the sars-kov-2 is differently guided by a selected, deep-shrink change.
Counter-counsel thought of the third wild animal in the wild was seen between the Sars-Kov-2 relative of Pongolin and the RatG13 by the second-community.
The combination is as widespread as the change in pressure as the heil is among the beta-covetous.
The Hussaneu is at the beginning of the Sars-Kov-2 zootic.
In addition to Hchkov, who is a major cause of disease, Hchkov-229E, Hchkov-OC43, Hchkov-NL63 and Hchkov-HKU1 were studying the location of Hchkov-229E, Hchkov-OC43, Hchkov-NL63 and Hchkov-HKU1
Falojanic evidence suggests that the two Hchkov-NL63 and Hchkov-229E probably originated in Lilt Waff Kovech, and the Hchkov-HKU1 family found viruses in rats.
ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge Cove) has shown a close connection with Hitchkov-NEL63, which is seen in North America's blackbird.
On the other hand, while Hchkov-229I is related to another night bird in Ghana named Hiphosidos/GanaKwam/199/2008, camels are also considered to be medium bearers.
To make our understanding of Hitchkov from animals is clearly covered in pictures 1 and 2 of the table.
Pyelogenetic analysis and historical evidence of the transmission of Hitchkovoch events.
About 1890, when Hchkov-Ossy43 was transmitted to domestic animals to attack, a respiratory epidemic was recorded.
The distribution of Hitchkov-229E is not quite clear among the seeds.
Bat Alfa-Kovs, who is close to Hčkov-229E, has been found.
Among them is Alpaca Alpha-Kov.
A number of lines of information support the direct transmission of the virus from the bats to humans.
First, people may contact nightbirds rather than alpacas.
Instead, people have not been in close contact with the Alpacas.
Second, the bat that met with Hitchkov-229E is not the cause and cause of the disease at night, and Alpaca Alpha-Kov has been the cause of the epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, Alpak Alpha-COV was found in wild animals.
So we should not stop believing that the Apacas may have met with Hchkov-229E and met Alfa-Kov from people.
Indeed, a wild dog's disease is a direct source of human-related viruses, including viruses, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
So it is not surprising that bats can pass Hitchkov-229IN directly to people.
As an alternative, a bat’s alpha-covetous can carry viruses such as Mers-Kov, alpacas, and Arab camels.
Mers-Kov can serve as a good example of a disease transmitted to a variety of species because it flows from camel to camel species.
The origin of the Mers-Kov period was first known as the nightbirds, and it was reinforced by successive discoveries.
It is obvious that nightbirds create a number of collections for the exchange of species and transmissions of species of species.
Long-term, long-term, great gathering, close contact and hard flying conditions for nightbirds to “enrich virus” in a good way.
Mers-Kov, on the other hand, had camels for a number of years.
They are well equipped for these camels, which have been transformed from the weight of the middle to the carrying of the permanent and natural reserves.
Mers-Kov retains a low degree of change in these animals when it causes a moderate disease.
It is a rare occurrence of disease in humans, and people remain so vulnerable to this mer-kov as long as there is no limit to the spread of the disease.
The sars-cove-2 distribution of camels is different from that of the Pongoles.
Pangolin beta - Kovoch is particularly highly health - conscious among the pangolines.
They can be the last carriers for beta-coves to meet with SARS-2, as is the case with Sars-Kov Keith.
A number of chances of transmitting sar-cove-2 to humans need to be controlled in future studies and beyond.
At first, nightbirds may be carriers of the sars-cove-2 virus and the like of the sars-cove-2.
By feeding animals or by mining coals, human children can share the same ecological structure with a few bats.
Second, the Pangolin carriers and the Sars-Kov-2 virus are new.
It is the time when men are caught with the virus, when they kill and feed wild animals.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, can be exposed to sar-cove-2.
The treatment of pets and wild animals is permitted for antibodys (antibodis).
A third, as mentioned above, may have been a third species in the Sarce-Kov-2 remodeling and adaptation process, which has been linked to the nightbirds and the pangolines.
The search for an animal source of Sars-Kov-2 is still under way.
Unlike animal-loaders, the three main causes of the virus are essential for the development of cocaine across the borders of the whole organism.
First come the measure of the glare from a high point of view in the anaesthetics of the anesthetic.
Compared to other single-combined RNA viruses, the estimated volume of Kovoc change can be assigned to novel carriers, replacing an average of ~10-4 instead of an average of ~10-4 instead of an average of ~2 in 2 places from "media" to "high" levels.
Kovoch has exsoriboliculis, and this destruction results in extremely high changes in the marine environment and inability to reduce or continue.
Amazingly, the same remedesvir niculotoid is known as Cove's oppression, which is being maintained by this hypertribonocules and RNA-resilient RNA polymers.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-sars-cove-2 agents examined in clinical trials.
But, in million times, the capacity to breed Kovech is greater than their load.
Also, when Kovoch is not well adapted to the carrier, the rate of mutation is often high.
Compared with sars-cove, which has a high degree of foreign exchange, Sars-cove-2 has a very low degree of verbal exchange, which is a sign of a high level of humanization.
Perhaps he had already become accustomed to another bearer, who is near to men.
In addition to the Sars-Kov-2, Mars-Kov also looks at it, and this has been practiced on one-shoe camels.
On the one hand, genetic Drift vaccine and anti-viral vaccine will not succeed quickly in SAR-Kov-2.
Second, the wide-ranging Arenea Genome in Kovoch releases additional plasticism into the development of the gynano by nature and recombination, which increases the chance of joint evolution for the species to develop when conditions are favorable, thus enabling the Novel Coronavirus to occur.
This is supported by a number of specific features of reading and by proteins that have been introduced to end 3′ and end 3′.
"Threeth: Kovech RNA can suddenly and repeatedly duplicate and exchange itself with a special "copy-choice" method."
Here is the time of the Kove RNA version, which often occurs in the form of a loader, which is used as a blender.
At the same height and at the same time, the genomic subs can regroup together to create a new cove.
Natural regrouping was found at HHKOV1 and HKOV-OC43, and at night at SL-CoV and BatCoV-HKU9 at night.
A carrier’s contact with a virus
Along with the above three viral causes, there is another crucial and influential factor for the distribution of the burden species.
The reinsertion of Sars-Kov is taken as an example, and this shows evidence of a positive selection during the events that will pass through the seed.
Based on my contrast analysis, the sars-kovich, the sars-kow, and the sars-kow are able to adapt rapidly to various bearers, especially to the changes of S-Protin-ribids.
All in all, RBD, which is found in the Cove S protein outlet, is connected to the cellulator, and the anti-sicker response is widely selected.
RBDW is located on the S1 section of the SRS-Kow, which is connected by ACE2 to the viral entry corridor.
Sear-cove RBD (adhesive end-of-end) has the ability to detect the recipients of ACE2, including the nightbird, the whale, the mouse, and the raccoon, which allows transmission of the virus to the strains.
Also, 6 amino acid wastes have been shown as distinct enemies from humans and from the pure virus, and 4 of them are on the theme of a photo-adhesive device.
Civet Sars-Kov Arbidi (the recipient’s end of the adhesive) has changes in K479 and S487 and has increased the connection of human-assembly protein to the SS2 recipient.
In other words, these two amino acid exchangers may be crucial to enabling the virus to be linked to the person.
The passage of SARS-Kov-2 cells in the same way as SARS-Kov is very interesting.
The 30% difference between Sars-Kov-2 and Sars-Kov can be stopped by the close association of its S-protein with the ACE2 sacrifice unit, which shows S-protein in the S1 unit.
Indeed, the KREI-IM study suggests that this adhesive has a 10- to 20-fold greater binding than that between the people of ACE2 and SRS.
To transmit a sar-cove-2, it is necessary to determine which one of the main receivers is required or not.
Amazingly, Hitchkovich-NL63 adheres to ACE2 but they are with another S.
There are many others who accept echkov, such as aminopeptides NC to echkov-229E, and 9-O-aceticated maleic acid to Hchkov-Ossy43.
After being passed through the wildebeests of the animals they carried, they played a great role in the successful adaptation of this kovch to the people.
In addition to cellulaire recipients, the results of the spread of the Hitchkov species are guided by other bearers and other reasons.
The species of rats with human and night weights, a hemp of one camel and long-faced mice can limit the transmission of these carrier proteins to species.
To have a successful species cross-border, Hčkov has to take over the host's asylum issues and write down the host's hosts.
In this regard, we are the only ones who decide, distinguish and assign to the sea about the vital viral carrier.
The use of wisdom-level technology can be useful if you use the sars-kow-2-channel to test the specific causes and causes of the CRISPR.
The Rise of Novel Hitchkovich: Back to the Beginnings
Nightbirds have a great chance of occurring to Novel Kovoch.
In this case, nightbirds serve as Hitchkovochs.
In addition, rapid change and re-arrangement serve as two stages in this few elongation.
For example, it has great potential to change the state of the virus by identifying novell protein cells.
Among the sar-cove proteins, the state of human adaptation has been found to be necessary for the OARF8, although, as was the case with the sar-cove-related bats, they have come in for the introduction of various OARF8 proteins.
The disappearance of SAR-COVOC 29-nucleotide has been found in the most isolated efforts of the first time in human history.
This spray produces a well-trained breeding crop by dividing ORF8a and ORF8b into ORF8.
In addition, Sars-Kov Khalif and Gamma-Kovs-Kovch can have a historical relationship because tiny particles are found in RNA-reliance in RNA-polymeres.
Refractory sites are also seen in Nsp9, mostly Nsp10, and Nsp14.
Similarly, the variety of species that took place on one of Saudi Arabia's teats showed that the Mers-Kov epidemic had created a combination of events.
There was a combination of Sars-Kov and Mers-Kov, another Czech confederation, which was a time when their genes were reconnected to other Kovoch animals.
The choice of a person, especially if he or she is in the immune system of a powerful carrier, is a matter of great caution, since he or she may be able to produce an unexpected injection of the virus from the transmission of the virus.
One example of these injuries is the reduction of the full length of the HCCP-229I protein load of OARF4; this means that two nucleotoids are lost.
OREF4 connected to Hitchkov-229I has been detected by nightbirds and camel viruses, and the introduction of the alpaca alpha-cove is shown by the change in cover.
The last, the Novel Hitchkovich's evolution is also driven by the electoral pressure in the storage tanks.
When nightbirds hit a covetch, they show it with no sign or little sign; they show that there is no match between nightbirds and covets.
Nightbirds have been shown to adapt to the covi in an ecological and physical way.
For example: During the night, the blind bird is less able to show signs of the disease than it is before.
On the other hand, the largest number of histopathological signs is low, since the weight of natural killer cell cells under the wings of a bird is prevented from growing at the top of the NKG2/CD94.
In addition, high oxygen reaction (ROS) activity of higher nightbirds can cause stress to the Kovoch user or damage reading again in the egolibonukulus; thus, a selection pressure for the virus causes a major disease when it enters a new carrier.
More disease - causing fibers can also grow by mixing, which leads to new proteins or proteins to adapt to the needs of the carrier.
So, the third of the last two years of Novel Hitchkov is not a coincidence.
COVCH is not the main carrier of night birds and camels, nor is it the cause of disease.
And so shall they be hungry, when they have not received the answer of a strong carrier's disease.
Here is why the unmarked carriers are seen and why they cause serious infections to people.
The most serious symptoms of the disease are the high incidence of sytokine on the site where there is a highly alert response to the disease and a strong response to the disease, and the more severe the symptoms are, the worse the lung injury is.
In contrast, the response of the signal carriers was lower than that of Cove.
A response to resistance may have similar anti-sars-kov-2 methods with beneficial results.
Interferon’s response is different from that of bats.
Therefore, at least one third of the people involved should be able to manage I-interferon at the beginning of the SAR-cove-2 infection.
In addition, the onset of NLRP3 infilmasom is lacking in night birds.
In this case, waiting for NLRP3 enzyme can be used to treat COVID-19 from MCC950.
In general, Sars-Kov and Mers-Kov have followed the origins of Sars-Kov-2.
The bat-coves night has been found to be 95 % of the klotoid-component, while the other is the sar-cove-2 and 96% of the solo-necrotoid-shared nightbird-cove.
But marketers and other animals have a virus similar to sar-cove; there are still close carriers of sar-cove-2.
Amazingly, the pangolin beta-covetous has been found to be a cars-cove-2 homologus, which can be the closest to the carrier of the sars-covet or the pangolin beta-covech to the final sars-cove-2 gains.
Although there are questions, there is no evidence to support the idea that the sar-cove-2 is being thought of or that the person is a failure.
Kovech has returned to his attention because of the recent outbreak of the Sars-Kov-2 epidemic.
The study of Jehovah’s Witnesses in bats and other animals has greatly changed our understanding of the importance of the origins of chocophobic disease and of animal carriers.
Sars-Kov, Mers-Kov and Sars-Kov-2 have been shown to be the source of nightbirds and to be transmitted to people by medium carriers.
The Sars-Kov infection would have been halted if markets had been closed and the lawyers killed because of public contact on the market.
Similarly, taking into account the presence of many species of the sars-cove-2-related Pongolin beta-covetous, it is necessary to remove the peoples of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from the wet market in order to prevent the transmission of the disease agent to the person.
However, sars-cove-2 will be transmitted to the person by means of pangulin and other animals, without transmission or future study of how it is transmitted.
On the other hand, there was a long way to go with a Shean camel of Mers-Kov.
These camels are used to transport, meat, milk, soap and leather products to the local community.
From the Middle East to Africa, they are widespread.
So it is not possible to paint all camels as in the market of wild animals to prevent the spread of sars-cove and sars-cove-2 in China.
In order to stop the frequent epidemic of Mers, a comprehensive route is necessary, and it is useful to get effective vaccines to protect the camel from mer-kow, along with other infectious measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new strains can occur that cause epidemics.
A variety of zootic coves are moving in the wild.
In particular, the bats, who are able to cause disease, are very different.
Together again, these Sonotic Kok has many chances that new Kovch will be highly infectious and/or that in the future they will be lethal to the people.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, wild animals must not be used for food in some parts of China.
In view of the dangers of concrete, mercere and COVID-19, there is a need for high-preparation and full-time therapy.
Indeed, many viruses have been on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in the natural state of mind until there is a condition that is suitable for distribution.
Although bats have many chances of transmitting viruses, there is less contact with bats and other wild animals who know how to avoid them.
Continued monitoring of mammals is essential for better understanding of the genetics of the covoine and its natural bearers, which proves the value of preventing transmission from animal to human disease and future epidemics.
To sum up, the most effective way to prevent the outbreak of a virus is to avoid the biological origin of the disease - causing viruses.
There are many small objects that are being added to the sars-cove-2.
If the nightbird transmits seed to the pangolin, there is a need for a study of what the nightbird and the pangolin are like.
Second, if nightbirds play a more direct role in human transmission of the virus, it should be known how humans can interact with nightbirds.
Third, it should be made clear how a third mammal can be connected to other species, including real people, bats, and panglins.
Finally, many mammals, including domestic animals, can be exposed to sar-cove-2, and both should be infected and researched.
If nightbirds, pangulins, or other animals are known in nature as sars-cove-2 or similar viruses.
Further research in this area explains the sars-cove-2 rotational course in animals, as well as ways of preventing and controlling COVID-19 in humans.
The COVID-19 case and the unconfirmed case need to be judged
On February 6, 2020, our teams published rapid counselling to investigate and treat infection of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which provides our experience and provides a good opportunity worldwide to fight the epidemic.
But Corona's disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our knowledge and alertness continue to grow gradually through ongoing research and clinical practice.
In this letter we presented the new diagnostic examination and medical guidance provided by the People's Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, which answered our opinion in our guidance and provided us with the new criteria for examination and medical guidance for COVID-19 (Seventh Root).
In December 2019, Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was infected, the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the severe respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (Sars-cove-2), now officially known as Coronavirus.
In March 11, 2020, WHO designated the COVID-19 Global Epidemic.
To fight SARS-CoV-2, our team prepared rapid counselling and published on-line military medical research in February 06, 2020.
Since its publication, it has been very interesting.
But note that COVID-19 is a new disease, based on current research and clinical practice, our understanding and knowledge are gradually increasing, so the diagnostic and medical techniques will be improved in a row.
For example, in the People's Republic of China, the National Health Committee (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) issued seven editions from January 16 to March 3, 2020, with some titles changing dramatically.
He has now accepted our direction, and they have made a simple presentation based on their clinical practice.
Their work brings new evidence to our guidance, and it is a useful and useful reward for this epidemic around the world.
We support this vital action, and we express our thanks.
However, according to the COVID-19 (seventh experiment) and recent studies, their roots are based on recent testing and medical guidelines.
According to the seventh edition (March 3x2020), for an overall examination of the suspected case, two clinical descriptions must be provided to ensure that the three clinical epidemiologicals will have to be included, unless it is clear:
Epidemiological history: (1) within 14 days prior to the onset of the disease, the COVID-19 cases reported on in the water city and its environment, or on other issues of COVID-19, (2) the history of travel or presence, (2) the history of contact with infectious issues (with an aluminium acid test), (3) the history of contact with patients in sick patients (for example, at home, in the office, on the day/house...) in the small areas of the city and the environment, or in other communities associated with COVID-19, or the history of contact with fever or respiratory symptoms, (4) the collection of confirmed cases (for example, at home, at home, on the day/home...).
Clinical descriptions: (1) fever and/or respiratory signs; (2) with the main image characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) with regular, reduced, or first-time reduced lymphocyte counts.
An examination of the confirmed case should be based on the following suspicions: (1) for SARS-COV-2 the actual PCR test positive; (2) the overall genetic sequence of the known virus showing high behaviour to the known Novel Coron virus; (3) the serum examination of a certain IgM anti-human and to the IgG anti-Sars-Cov-2 anti-human anti-Sars-Cov test positive, or from the Sars-Cov-2 specified IgG Antibody from negativ to positive, or more than 4 times as much as the recovery level over time.
Nucleic acid has been added to the second and third versions (Janwary 22x2020) to the actual-time PCR test for respiratory or blood samples.
The blood sample was added to the fourth (January 27x2020) and fifth (February 8x2020) editions. Then the seroological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These adjustments, based on the further work of the investigators, are a good nuclear acid test tool for rapid testing, and a blood sample of the respiratory organs, which can be used to add various samples to the apparatus and to produce special anti-human results within the established standard.
In addition, there is a great deal of more and more that we are concerned about paying attention to patients who show signs and don't show signs of an emergency.
Therefore, because people who do not have clinical signs are considered a small threat, Zhou et al. will have to be renewed.
In addition to the system, clinical exercises and studies should be checked.
To sum up, we invite readers to comment, for there is direct evidence.
“Unforeseen” and “unverified charges”, we advise them to investigate, follow new rules and obey their country of origin.
Our company has kept our instruction from time to time to help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths by COVID-19
Yesterday, because of COVID-19, Bangladesh confirmed that five new deaths were recorded that day.
This is the highest amount of death recorded in one day because of the virus.
Until yesterday, Bangladesh’s epidemiology, IEDCR, has reported 114 medically active and 33-year-old cases of injuries.
The death of 17 men is recorded in all.
In the summary of the online news, Dr. Merjday Sabri and Flora, director of IEDCR, said that four of the dead and one woman are in their turn.
According to Dr. Marjaday, two patients over 60 years of age are between 51 and 60 and a 41 - 50 years of age.
He said, "Two of his sons came from Dachah."
On March 11 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared CDID-19 an epidemic.
The hospital official, Jalal Saipur Rahman, the director of the Benigali Anti-corruption Commission, who had been under surveillance at the Kwait Mittree Hospital, announced that they were the local news service for Andulu Egensi.
On Saturday, in a video announcement, Bangladesh's road and bridge transport minister Obaidul Quader said that it would close up to the next Saturday, beyond what was originally planned for public transport.
This public transport closure started on March 26, and is planned to stop on Saturday, April 4.
Transport -- medical, fuel and food -- was still permitted.
COVID-19 was first registered in Bangladesh on March 8, and was the wife of two people who had returned from Italy.
Since March 19, these three have recovered.
The number of victims of SARS-CoV-2 in the world is over a million
On Thursday, the total number of victims of SARS-CoV-2 is more than one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 deaths have been associated with a coronary disease.
The first corona virus-related death was observed in Malawi, where it was confirmed that there were the first victims.
North Korea has been one of the few countries that since Thursday have been free of coronary virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced yesterday that, at April 4, 0800 UTC, a total of 1,051,635 victims, including 79,332 cases, were found within the twenty-four hours of the day after the day of central Europe.
In the United States, at least 5,900 people have died and more than 244 thousand have been diagnosed with coronary virus.
CBS News reported on Johns Hopekins University information, which killed more than 1,000 people in America on Wednesday because of Coron and virus infection.
Around the world, countries have announced that they have decided to take firm measures to curb the spread of the disease.

Australia’s stores have reduced the quantity of toilet paper in one business
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian store chains reduced the sales limits to two and one package on all national stores.
And Aldi van Pack introduced the boundary on Monday.
These limits were placed on the links of financial indices and Facebook sites.
Consumers reportedly collected goods because of fear of COVID-19 and because they thought that there could be a specific stay.
On Wednesday, the Woolworths sent out a package to purchase the toilet paper/softs to be taken home.
These changes followed in the order of March 4 and 5 the previous four-packed package introduced by the Wolworths and Coles.
Coles, in a press release on March 8, called it “an unexpected” Tuesday in the Facebook Book on the four-prohibited program “in an hour and still selling many stores” and“ Never before seen”.
Last week, according to the spokesman for the Wolworths, a salesman showed a "high increase".
The Costco store in Canberra reduced the permitted size of last week to two locks.
To reduce the stock, Coles has added larger packages from suppliers and delivery orders, and Wallers has in turn ordered additional items for sale, and ALDI has prepared special sales for a planned Wednesday.
Rusel Zimerman, director of the company's retailer’s business, said that the sales wanted to increase, but the local council’s restrictions on the arrival of a truck made it difficult.
As providers and others look forward to the delivery of different filters, the cost of production is expected to decrease.
On Monday, the Aldi announced that certain warehouses were not going through a special day after Stok's release.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer of the University of Technology, said that the stores are full of sales items at night.
The toilet paper/soft is a large item, which makes it a small number in the classrooms and when it is sold, a wide-ranging platform is created, creating a sense of lack.
"As ABC records, "Colls and Wallers have many objects on the shelf, a toilet Sanitazer and a towel can reduce the confusion that occurs if too much is done," says Russell Szmerman.
The cutter said last Wednesday that he was about to end their collection of toilet paper.
Kimberley-Clark, Knex toilet software, and SOLARIS paper are used to build this garbage collection, which is based on a News.com.au report that 24/7 works to support supplies.
The state-of-the-state website Domain.com reports some property sellers on the first free-on-cleaning article in Melbourne, which offers paper/softs for the last day of the long week, since the governments are on vacation.
Darwin's skilled edition of the NT News included an eight-page edition of Thursday, to be used as a tear and toilet paper.
At first, they refused to impose restrictions, and on March 3, they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions to purchases based on a report from ABC Australia.
Russell Zimmerman’s Masks, Sunitazer, dry materials, handwashing and flour have added to the demand for other products.
Similarly, outside of Australia, British Online Oakek Supermarquet announced that only 12 prisons were sold on Sunday.
WHO declared COVID-19 a global epidemic
Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) has now declared COVID-19 transmissions to be a global epidemic of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The word “panemek” is not just about what quantity it is, but about what quantity it is, and what quantity it is about to spread.
"All countries can still change the course of this epidemic."
"The director of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanum, did what Jesus said: "If countries have investigated, if they have, if they have, if they have been able to search, if they have responded to the people."
In view of the seriousness and seriousness of the illness, we place great emphasis on appropriate action.
"In the former US Department of Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Tom Freiden, the basis of the epidemic has been called the "Unknown" "of the epidemic."
"There was no respiratory virus other than influenza in the February of February in the CNN's comments," he said, "from the occurrence to the next global spread."
"Do Jesus show the same view that he said, "We have not seen an epidemic of the virus."
"We've never seen an epidemic that can be controlled before," he said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has followed a decision to call your new epidemic an emergency to the international threat of public health.
Dr. Anthony Faussi of the American Institute of National Allergens and Transmissible Diseases says: “The spread of the disease is getting deeper into the community.
Since Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there are 126,000 COVID-19 cases around the world, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronary virus epidemic is spreading, and it is coming from the major respiratory corn virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was known later, China, December 2019, and January 2020 was declared an unprecedented public health threat by March 11, 2020.
April 10x2020, an estimated 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries, with an estimated 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
It is estimated that the figure is 4% in China, and in the rest of the world it will be 13.04% in Algeria until 08% in New Zealand.
Hemorrhagic fever, cough, and respiratory problems are the main signs.
Additions include neomonia and urgent respiratory distress syndrome.
From exposure to symptoms, it usually lasts for five days, but this may be two to forty-four days.
There is no known vaccine or anti-viral therapy for this.
The main causes are advertising and supportive care, which involves washing the hands of counseling measures, covering the mouth, keeping someone else safe, and keeping them out of their way for those who think they have been injured.
Officials around the world have responded by applying travel limits, quarantines, time limits, workplace hazard numbers, and the closure of fascists.
The epidemic has resulted in severe international socio-economic stress, sports, religious, political and cultural provisions being prolonged and repealed, resulting in large-scale savings in panic shopping.
In 193 countries, schools and universities in the environment or on an international scale have been closed, affecting a total of 99.4 percent of students.
There is hatred and isolation among citizens from China, South and East Asia and other countries that have seen the virus because of the spread of accurate information about the virus on Online.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced as a result of reduced travel and heavy industrial closures.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (in the capital of the state of Huabi), launched an investigation into the unknown phenomenon in January 2020 by means of an undiscovered anti-Neumonian phenomenon on December 31, 2019.
Most events are related to the wholesale market for natural food, and it is estimated that the virus has a zootic origin.
The virus that led to the spread is the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to the heart of the night birds, the gonavirs, and the SARS-CoV. The person with the first symptoms of the disease has been infected with the disease on 1 December 2019, and that individual has no relation to a wet market assignment.
Two thirds of all cases seen in the early 2019 Wassassian were related to the market.
Back to November 17, 2019, South China’s Moring Post reported that the first 55-year-old São Paulo in Kobe State was found at the site. According to WHO’s record of February 26, 2020, new cases were being reduced in China and, unlike in Italy, Iran and South Korea, there was an increase in print.
There may be many minor cases, especially among those with low health care.
On April 26, a few cases were recorded among young people under 19 years of age, holding about 2.4% of the world’s cases. Patrick Valance, the U.S.
The cases are for COVID-19 and for those who have been investigated and for whom the official protocol has been confirmed to be positive.
On 23 March, there were no more than 3% of the people surveyed, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland, were without the rules of Belgium.
According to a survey published in France on March 16, 86% of COVID-19 distributions were not known until January 23 in China. These unrecorded distributions were the source of 79% of the disease's registered spread.
The statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of victims in Italy would be higher than the recorded cases.
The first estimate for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
The study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and M fell to 5.7.
The majority of people with COVID-19 recover.
They don't know him. The time to die when one person has seen a sign is from 6 to 41 days, and the most common 14 days.
By April 10, 2020, some 97,000 deaths were recorded in the meeting with COVID-19.
By February 5, 80% of China’s registered deaths were over 60 years old, and 75% had permanent blood circulation and diabetes. The official death rate of COVID-19 was generally based on official protocols, which involved people who had died as positive COVID-19.
The death toll can be increased by COVID-19, not including those who died without questioning, such as housenuts, home - to - house medicines, and so on.
In Italy, half of Italy’s gifts were more than 4-5 times higher than COVID’s official death rate during the global epidemic.
“We know that the USC is underestimated” (CDC), “we know that the word “management” is underestimated,” and “we know that underestimated reports of this nature occur occasionally during the epidemic, just as in 2009 the H1N1 Swain spread was on special H1N1 distribution. The first water-confirmed death of Keith occurred on January 9, 2020.”
The first death was created in the Philippines on February 1, China, and the first death on February 14, France, outside Asia.
Just as January 28, death was recorded outside China in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On March 13, every continent reported death in more than 40 countries and states except Antarctica, and various measures have been taken jointly to measure the death toll.
These numbers vary in the environment, but since then they have been under pressure by the number of examinations, the quality of health services, the medical and election choices, when the epidemic has occurred, and people's diets, such as age, sex and general health.
According to statistics at the University of Johns Hopkins, until April 10, 2020 the total death toll of 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) was 6.0%.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, the level of death in the Keith-Keys decreased from 17.3% (A.A. since January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (A.A. after February 1, 2020). Other measures include the level of CFR, which shows the number of people who have passed through the disease, and the level of infection (IFR) that last their lives show the number of people (examined and unexamined).
These statistics are not time-bound, and if a particular population is infected, they will be followed by a certain population on average by a specific procedure.
Many scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for a certain number of people.
It is estimated that from 0.1% to 0.39% of deaths caused by this epidemic are at the heart of Oxford University’s health system.
The first consideration of this ring is the COVID-19 test conducted in Germany and a CFR-based statistical study.
According to the WHO, the epidemic can be controlled.
Not only can it be difficult to say with certainty how high the epidemic is and how long it lasts but it can also vary from place to place.
Penn State University Marsage Pen, “remains visible, and the infection epidemic remains the same, and it gets fewer and less of the infected. ”
But when will this be as it is, and now it is impossible to imagine."
"The Chinese government's leading health adviser, Zihong Nashan, argues that if all countries move to follow the advice of the World Health Organization (WHO) on measures to curb the spread of the virus, "it may stop by January".
“On March 17, London’s Clean and Tropical Medicine and Adam Kucharsky SARS-CoV-2,” he said, “is seen repeatedly for a year or two.”
"There is a need for a vaccine (perhaps 18 days or more)"
"William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University says, "I think it's difficult to say that this virus is completely gone" and that it can come back every year and be turned into a seasonal disease."
The damage to return is determined on the basis of a combination of mymutitions and DNA.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may not be unique in terms of people who are infected.
Two common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
A few common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory fluid generation (acta), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headaches, tremors, relapses, an urgent blood transfusion, vomiting or bloating. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 1 out of every 6 people may be seriously ill and unable to breathe.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed emergency symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, constant chest pain or stress, sudden conflict, difficulty walking, and blundering of the face and lips; if these signs are seen, medical attention is given quickly; further spread of disease leads to bad lungs, severe respiratory pressure, breakdown, pollution and death.
Researchers have suggested that some of the infected people probably have no signs, no clinical signs but no confirmed infection, that people who have been infected with confirmed infections should be closely monitored and examined to avoid infection.
The Chinese estimated the contrast to be a few to 44%.
The normal breeding period (the time between the infection and the mark) is from one to 14 days in the region, usually five days. An example of uncertainty, with COVID-19, has lost the sense of smelling a fraction of people, first 30%, then 15%.
Some details of how the virus is transmitted are yet to be revealed.
The disease is centrally transmitted through close contact and in contact with nails, sneezing, or tiny droplets during conversation, and close contact is between 1-2 meters (3-6 feet) and 3-6 feet).
Studies have found that uncovered clay can cause moisture from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some conclude that the virus can be passed on in the stream of speech and that these droplets can remain in the air for a long time.
And they shall be able to rest upon the mouths of them that are near, or to draw them to the lungs.
Cardiopulmonary recovery (CPR) can surgically expose airborne diseases.
Anyone who has a contaminated floor and this skin, including skin, can touch them after touching their eyes, nose or mouth, and spread them.
Despite the so-called threat of cross-border transmission, this threat is very small.
The government of China has denied the oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. At first, the virus appears to be highly transmissible for three days, even though it has no sign and no symptoms, but it can be spread by hand.
Three days before people began to show signs, the disease was confirmed, which showed that the disease could be passed before it was shown.
A very few cases of disease were confirmed in the Laboratory, but similar distributions were found when they were examined without Nikki in other countries.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has made it clear how easily the disease spreads, that it is not entirely obvious that one to three individuals will pass on the disease. The virus can last for hours to days on the floors.
The virus can last for up to four hours, especially on plastics (polypropylene) and 304 on stainless steel.
But this varies from one moisture to another on the temperature. Home animals and other raising animals have also become positive COVID-19.
While there is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, British authorities recommend that their hands be washed, as if they had touched the floor of the infected person.
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a serious respiratory disease of Novel virus, the first of three people with a lung disease that is associated with a serious respiratory disease class in Oahan.
Novel sars-kov-2 virus all features occur in nature with a virus related to a virus: outside the human body, the virus kills soap at home, because soap removes its protective cover. Sars-cove-2 is closely related to the main sars-kov.
It is remembered that there is a beginning of the Zonothk.
According to genetic testing, the corn virus is assigned to two other strains from genetics, the gynaecology virus (lineage B).
At all levels of genome, the other nightbird’s chronovirus (BatCov RAG13) is 96%.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in some of the genetic sequences between PNGs and human viruses.
So far, the entire gene contrast has been found between the Congolese Coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2 that they share about 92% of racial-mal-methral, which is enough to ensure that the PNGs are medium bearers.
The virus infection can be treated on the basis of the signs, but the evidence for the River's Transcript Polymers Chin Reaction (RRT-PCR) or CT images is evidence.
The study of PCR in Wauhan, who compared CT to CT, revealed that CT is more exposed than PCR, but that this is a somewhat lower degree of clarity compared to many other TB and disease processes.
By March 2020, U.S. Radiology College advises that COVID-19 should not be used as a first-line test.
The World Health Organization (WHO) published the first edition in France on January 17 of a revised RNA screening process for SARS-CoV-2.
The experiment uses the response chain (rRT-PCR) against the actual-time polymerez version.
The examination may be made on a breath, or on a blood sample.
The overall result is within a few hours until one day.
Overall, the examination is carried out by nasal drains, and a sample can be taken from the throat. Many laboratories and organizations are preparing serological tests, which are different from the antibiotics.
Since April 6, 2020, none of these have been sufficiently proven to be widely used.
The cyrologic experiment, which was built in the Americas, has been approved only by found-for-accident labs.
Radiographs and calculator tomography (CT) and the character of people with marks are a liquid between the trunk and the lungs, which include a glass of a single shape without a single shape.
The Italian Radiology Community is operating an online image database that shows proven events.
Because of the combination of other infections, such as adenovirus, an unconfirmed PCR image is limited in its ability to distinguish COVID-19 from a PCR.
A major study in China compared the TCT chest with PCR and considered it to be a quick and more careful means of screening for epidemics, although an image is a little different to the disease.
Artificial intelligence - TC - TC - TN - has been developed to detect visible features of the virus on radiographs and City.
Overall good hygiene, hand washing, preventing the eyes, nose, or mouth from touching and squeezing, as well as putting the sophistication directly into a garbage bin.
Victims are advised to wear a sergical bracelet before going to a public place.
Physical restraints are also advised to prevent the transmission of disease. Many governments have advised against all unnecessary travel between and from countries where the spread of disease has spread.
But in many parts of the world, the virus has reached the level of spread in the community.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community, and some members of the community do not know where and how it is infected. Health - care workers who take care of the potential exposure to the disease are advised to be sensitive to formal and standard precautions, to be careful and to be alert. It is an important way to check whether there is physical contact with the infected person, to ensure that health authorities are informed of the source of the disease and to prevent transmission of the disease.
The use of mobile phone information by the government has caused personal fears, along with Amenity International and over 100 other organizations, to call for such surveillance.
A number of mobile apps are about to be used on a video set, and in April 7, 2020, more professionals are about to use them as well.
If users are close to a person who has been tested positive for COVID-19, they will receive a message. Misconceptions about how to prevent infections are spreading, such as washing the nose and washing the mouth.
There is no vaccine available for COVID-19, although many organizations are working to create it.
Washing the hands is advised to reduce the spread of the disease.
For at least 20 seconds, the CDC advises people to wash their hands with soap and water, especially after they go to the bathroom or when they openly rot; before eating: touch the nose, touch, or bite.
This is because the virus dies outside the body by fasting and washing.
Where soap and water are not available, the CDC advised the use of 60% alcohol in the hands.
WHO advises people not to touch their eyes, noses or mouth with unwashed hands.
In many solutions (made for iron in one minute), from 62–71% ethanol, 50–10% propopellol, 0.1% sodium hypochloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidon-iodine can be cleaned.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chrohexidin gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC advises that COVID’s environment is a service environment; it is suspected or verified in such places as office or child labor; it needs to be cleaned with drugs that destroy the virus; it needs to be washed, it is a common use environment; it needs to be used to clean up the virus.
Health organizations have advised people to cover their mouths and noses with a folded arm or a net and to cast away any net immediately.
Sergical practice is only for those who are ill-treated, because the reason is that the virus is spread far and wide, and people are told, synapses and Silas limit the spread of the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has given guidelines on when and how to use our shirt.
"On the basis of Stephen Griffin, a biologist at the University of Ligs, "the use of a pins/tips can reduce the condition of people's face contact, thus preventing a major source of infection that could be created by hands that are not properly washed."
While healthy people should not wear a front and back cover with those who support the COVID-19, they are advised by the T.D.C., although it is good to wear a front and nose cover and they are aware of it.
Many countries have begun to encourage the use of their people’s front fins.
In the United States, CDC’s advice is to make frontal masks that are not used for medical purposes. China also recommends using single-use medical masks, especially when people are in close contact with other people.
When using public transport or staying in crowded areas, he recommends that a sergical mask be made.
Thailand’s health officers are encouraging people to wear and wash clothes every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia refused to go out into the street without wearing a skirt or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam ordered all citizens to protect themselves and others by wearing a front cover when going out to public places.
The Austrian government has forced anyone who enters into a junkie store to wear a frontal coat.
Israel asked for a covering of mouth and nose, when all its citizens went out.
Taiwan has been producing tens of millions of feet a day since the end of March, and has ordered train passengers and city bus users to use April 1 as their front legs.
Panama was forcing all those who were going out to go to the front, and she was encouraging those who could not afford to do what was done in the house.
Frontal branches have been widely distributed in Japan, North Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social isolation (so-called physical isolation) includes the protection of the immune system and reduces the spread of the disease by reducing contact between individuals.
The methods include identification and retention; travel ban; you shut down schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and entry centres.
By sitting in a house, by limiting travel, by not going to a busy place, by saying good-bye to individuals, by physically keeping their heads away from others.
Many governments are now promoting community isolation in the territories affected by the epidemic and are making it an obligation to do so.
The U.S. body of government and health has been consulted to reduce the number of gatherings from 250 (without any known COVID-19) to 50, from which to 10 people.
“On March 22, 2020, Germany prohibited more than two people from getting together: older people and those who look at the condition of the sick, heart disease, respiratory disease, blood loss, immune disorders, and serious illnesses and other factors, such as old age and cardiovascular disease, have replaced the CDC’s advice with the word “social isolation” in the “physical isolation” at the end of March, which is responsible for reducing social ties over the Internet or remoteness.”
The use of the term social isolation refers to those who should participate in a total social hatred, rather than counseling them to keep in touch with others by means of alternative means. Some authorities have given sexual health guidelines for use during an international epidemic.
These include sex only with a person who lives together and has no signs of the virus or the virus.
It is recommended that those who are suspected of being infected with the disease and who are caught by the COVID-19 sit at home alone.
Health Agencys have provided specific self-sustaining guidelines, and many governments recommend that people live in a place where the virus has occurred.
Strong self-sustaining instructions have been given to the most threatened groups.
Those who are likely to be at risk with the COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to the country or region where the virus was spread are advised to stay in the Ras-lito for 14 days since the last day of exposure.
The methods used to control the distribution are to prevent, prevent and reduce.
Banning the movement takes place in the early stages of the epidemic, and it is designed to introduce new ways of identifying and identifying the infected and reducing the spread of the rest of society.
If the spread of the disease cannot be curbed, attempts will be taken to reduce its spread and to cope with the consequences of health care and community.
The combination of steps can be taken.
He would like to reduce the basic number of fertility to below 1 and take more serious steps to reverse the global epidemic. One part of controlling the infectious disease is reducing the spread of the epidemic, known as the epidemic.
This allows more time for vaccines and treatments by ensuring that health service providers are not overburdened.
The most effective way to control the epidemic is to shut down schools, cancel programs for which people gather; to participate in society to bring about the acceptance of such prohibitions; and to clean up sufficient measures. When the epidemic hits a high point in China, they have taken strong steps to curb the epidemic.
Other countries have taken various steps to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced a majority of people to the investigation and to the identification of their seats, and has also produced ads when people are involved in the activities of contaminated people.
Singapore has repeatedly punished those who have not done this to support the understanding that they have isolated their heads for a time.
Taiwan’s frontal Mask has increased its production and distribution, showing Great Britain and the United States of America that a reduction (reducing the epidemic but reducing the spread) and control (closing the epidemic’s growth) have serious forces.
While the use of better policies reduces the first health problem by 2/3, death is halved by half, but thousands of deaths and health systems show that there is a lot of problem.
As long as the virus spreads in humans, it may be preferable to use oppression, but it has to wait (or wait for the vaccine, if it comes first), for the spread to return quickly.
Long-standing intervention to curb the invasion leads to a social and fraternal crisis.
There are no specific anti-viral medicines permitted for COVID-19, but there have been efforts to develop, including screening of common medicines.
Taking prescription-free drugs, drinking liquids, and rest can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on his weight, he may need oxygen therapy, blood transfusions, and respiratory support.
The use of steroids can lead to worse results.
Many permitted sites for the treatment of viral diseases are being examined for COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has also stated that some "traditional and homemade medicines" can provide relief from SARS-CoV-19 symptoms.
For COVID-19 patients, raising the health needs and providing health care is a basic measure of prevention of the spread of the disease, says WHO.
ECDC and WHO have provided guidelines for hospitals and primary health-care services, including increased capacity of COVID-19 screening and increased number of breathing machines and beds, where possible, for the elimination of procedures, the identification of COVID-19 positive patients and the training of staff and staff and the training of patients with disabilities and the increase in the number of breathing machines and beds.
There are many dreams about where the first event (patient zero) came from.
First on December 1, 2019, Koronovaris's case was water, Kobe, China.
Within a month, the levels of goronavirus in Hawaii have gradually decreased.
Most of these were connected to the seafood wholesale market in Hawaii, which is in addition to the direct sales of animals, and one of these types of biomimetic viruses comes from these types of animals. In other words, it is a zoonotic origin. An unknown cause in December 26 was seen in the pneumonia clinic, and Dr Zhang Jixian was treated by Zhang Jixian, who was informed on December 27 by the district hospital of Huan Jiang Giang DC.
"A.A. December 30, a group of doctors at the Wohan Central Hospital for their colleagues "SARS - Coronavirous like Coronavir."
Eight of the Nazi doctors, including Li Wenliang, were given a false report by police warning: The other, Ai Fen, was given the discipline of her superior, who was told that you had spread the word.
After the Wahn Municipal Health Commission, the Wahn Health Commission announced 31 December and the WHO.
The number of cases of unknown pneumonia was reported to the health authorities in the water for early January, and the number of cases doubled during the first phase of the distribution, every seven and a half days.
Early in January 2020, it helped spread the virus to other parts of China.
On January 20, China reported some 140 new injuries in one day, with two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Then, by January 20, 2020, official information from the United States showed 6,174 people showing the mark. On March 26, the United States had more confirmed than China and Italy. April 9,2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been registered internationally, and more than 97,000 people had died and more than 364,000 had recovered.
About 200 countries and provinces have at least one case.

Laboratory tests use some of the methods used for the respiratory tract’s corneal disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the related SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the methods used to detect antibiotics that respond to this infection.
The virus contained in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR and can detect the RNA virus.
This test is limited, and it is useful to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV-2.
It is a means of identifying very recent or emerging pollutants.
The identification of the Antibods (serology) helps to investigate and monitor people.
Antibodi tests show how many people have the disease, including how many people have the mark but how little or no to report it.
The correct level of death and the ability to prevent the disease can be known from this test.
Because of limited research work, no country in March 2020 is sure how much there is in the population.
Until March 23, any country has not examined its population for more than 3%, and there is a significant difference between the country and the country.
This separation has a greater potential to have a significant impact on death rates, since it is done in some countries than it is in some countries.
At the same time, it is possible to examine a sample found in RRT-PCR, using the same time time of time as the RRT-PCR.
The results are in a time of a few hours to two days.
Only during the first week of the disease will the test of RT-PCR be reliable when we take a sample of the fluid in the throat.
The virus can then multiply from the throat in the lungs.
An alternative sample device can be used for contaminated people in the second week, using a catheter or a salinity (removing) from the Dip Erweis.
One of the first PCR screenings was based in Berlin in January 2020, and the result was Charité. The same time, the same time response to the polymers chain (rRT-PCR) reversed, and the International Health Organization (WHO) distributed 250,000 surveys.
The United Kingdom prepared a review in January 23, 2020. The South Korean organization Kogenebiotech prepared a PCR-based clinical test tool (SARS-CoV-2) on January 28, 2020.
“E” in all viruses, and for SARS-CoV-2, the BGI group in China is one of the first companies to seek emergency benefits from the National Health Products Administration of China. The SARS-CoV-2, which is the basis for the PCR, is the CDC of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) at the same time, the RT-PCR Agency for the Community Health Laboratory, which distributes internationally.
Of the three random tests, an inaccurate result was found in the ancient regenerative system, and an error in the analysis of CDC occurred in Atlanta, where an average of 100 samples per day were successfully performed in the entire month of February 2020.

March 21/2020 likewise found EUA from the FDA and took 45 minutes.
FDA’s emphasis on isotrman’s nucleic acid indicates that technology should be used in a PCR replacement licence.
Since this variable temperature does not require a cycle, positive results will be achieved in up to five minutes and negative results in up to 13 minutes.
In the United States, there are some 18,000 machines at the present time, and Abbott speeds up the production of 50,000 tests a day. The test using the monoclonal antagonism is directly linked to the Novel Coron virus (N protein) and is hoped to show the result within 15 to 20 minutes, as is the rapid flu test.

A typical feature of City is the distribution of Mlylobar’s two Earth mirrores to partners, not upset and behind.
The underpressed weight of this disease will grow when we change the presence of this disease.
In the first point, a study comparing water PCR to CT shows that CT is more receptive than PCR, but that most of its image properties are of the same nature as pneumonia and disease.
In March 2020, U.S. Radiology College "CT should not be used for the first time by COVID-19 testing", and in March 2020 the CDC recommends that the first PCR test be used.
Disease prevention is an antibiotic product that includes IgM and IgG.
Since these signs began 7 days or more, people who have been showing signs may be tested at central laboratories (CLT) or at a point of contact (PoCT).
In most clinical experiments, the HY Sruput systems can perform these tests, and the amount of their presence will be determined by the size of the output in each system.
A blood sample is commonly used for CLT, but Cyrillic samples can be used to detect a response to disease.
The most common blood sample for POC is the injection of a needle.
Contrary to PCR methods, no start-up is necessary. On March 26, 2020, 29 agencies announced to the EGTT as necessary have now been able to disseminate anti-human tests.
On April 7, 2020, on the basis of an emergency permit, only one FBI test was granted. At the end of 2020, Euroimun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Dignostics IgG and IgA obtained a European permit to identify antibodies in blood samples.

Following the flood, 12 cities all over China were opened, including Schensen, Tayangi, Beijing, and Shanghai.
March 4 2020 saw a skilled mass examination of 50,000 patients a day. Opin Sores Multiplex Designs was released by the Origami Assays, using only 93 tests to test 1122 COVID19 patients. These balanced designs can be done in small experiments and do not require robots.
In the month of March, the shortage of testing substances and the shortage of European Unions, including the UK and the United States, became a major challenge in the process of examining the public.
This led some writers to examine some diagnostics, i.e. at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes, to release and further test the RNAs. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was more self-examined than any other country.
"This includes the whole population of the laboratory group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" laboratory in China). "

A variety of diagnostics incorporate the virus into the Ilama, produced in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has taken the production of German tools for itself to countries that have low incomes and are unable to establish their own.
The German organizer was organized on January 17, 2020, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not prepared until January 28, which delayed examinations in the United Chinese states, and the United States had problems at the time of the outbreak of the epidemic, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide adequate research tools and advice to health professionals.
In contrast, according to experts, the potential for extensive testing in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of Novel Coron and virus.
The South Korean government has often been building up its own research capacity in the Labratorioche sector for many years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that the COVID-19 epidemic be speeded up and tested to reduce the spread of the epidemic, and the demand for the high spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of HIV tests and chemical needs to be lacking.
In March 2020, China announced that there were problems with the accuracy of their tools.
The CDC scans in the United States had a "problem" and the government had removed the red tape that restricted private examinations. Spain had purchased tests from the Chinese organization Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but the results were incorrect.
According to the organization, the wrong results may be due to missing samples or misusing the tools.
According to the Spanish Ministry of Investigation, misdirected devices are replaced by a different test tool provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. The Czech Republic has produced 80% of its own research tools, and Slovakia has purchased 1.2 million of its own research tools, and they have provided misinformed information.

Researchers working in the city of Vă2 Italy conducted two round-trip checks on all 3,400 people in Italy, with the first recorded death of COVID-19, in a total of ten days.
About half of the positive people had no sign of anything, and all the known events were in the custody.
Because of restrictions on community travel, new infections have been halted.
By searching for a high line of communication, establishing and maintaining travel boundaries, the 2020 Coron and the virus epidemic has spread at a much lower speed than in other developed countries, but no measures have been taken to close up extremely heavy restaurants and welfare organizations.
A lot of vacancies were canceled, and Singapore also began to advise residents to stay home until March 28, but after a vacation, the schools opened up on March 23.
Many other countries have managed to control the epidemic by high contact surveillance, limited travel, investigation, and identification, but with limited national activity in Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that did more research than they died may be less likely to be caught, perhaps because these countries may be able to distinguish between simple and unmarked.
WHO recommends that national laboratories with experience in the conduct of the first five positive samples of COVID-19 and ten negative samples of COVID-19 be sent to one of the 16 screening centres of WHO.

In view of the 100 people surveyed at the following table, the Posetiv pillar is under the influence of the country’s research policy.
The country that examines only people in the hospital has a high percentage of the population, which, although marked, does not have to be changed.
Hand washing (or hand cleaning), also known as hand cleaning, is a hand cleaning that is used to remove dust, fats, microbes, or other nonessentials.
Washing the hands with soap during certain “specific times of the day” prevents the spread of many diseases, such as vomiting and cholera, which are transmitted to the mouth by hands that are not washed.
For example: If people do not wash their eyes, nose, or mouth before they touch them (mucus cells), they may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or common colds.
During the day, the following five critical opportunities to wash hands with soap include: before and after using the toilet, after cleaning the lower room, or after changing a diper, before and after eating the baby and before and after eating food, before and after handling raw meat, fish, or chicken meat.
Without water and soap, hands can be cleaned with ash. WHO recommends washing hands:
Before preparing, preparing and preparing food.
Before and after he took care of a sick man.
And after they had cleansed the child that came out of the house, whether he had changed, or had used a toilet.
After your nose is washed, chewed, or scratched.
After the animal has been replaced, eaten, or touched by animal waste.
The cleanliness of the medical hand is a routine of hygiene associated with medical and procedural procedures.
Washing hands before monitoring or treating medication can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main purpose of hand washing is to clean up disease - causing organisms (bacterial, viral, or disease - causing) and potentially harmful or disease - causing chemicals.
This is especially important for those who prepare food or do medical work, but it is also a useful experience for the general public.
Washing the hands has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, gonavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of vomiting; and reducing respiratory infections.
and plans to reduce the death of a baby at home.
According to a 2013 study, improved hand washing habits can result in minor improvements in the height of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, simple marine changes, such as soap washing the hands of children’s deaths associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, can be reduced.
This simple step can reduce the level of death caused by these diseases by 50%.
Interventions promoting hand washing can reduce the risk of one-third of the leaching conditions, which is comparable to providing clean water to low-income areas.
It can link the 48% reduction of the hands to soap washing. Smiling is the only effective and easy way to prevent the leaching in the home, in homes, and in societies around the world.
ARI is a major cause of death every year, killing an estimated 1.8 million children under five years of age.
About 3.5 million children die each year from a bout of vomiting and pneumonia.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap, before eating and using the toilet, can save more lives than any single vaccine or intervention, reduce the death to half of the lynching and severe respiratory infection, and reduce the death to a quarter.
Hand washing is often accompanied by other clean and sanitary measures, such as water, sanitation and personal hygiene (WASH).
Washing hands also protects them from contagious skin diseases transmitted through direct contact.
The small damage to hand washing can lead to skin damage due to drying.
According to a 2012 study in Denmark, excessive washing can lead to skin disease called handbending or handcuffing, which is particularly common among health-care workers.
The frequent washing of the hands is also one of the symptoms of OCD.
To reduce the spread of disease, there are five critical times in the day that soap and soap should be washed, after using the bathroom (water, pot), after cleaning the lower room (purity change), before eating the baby, before eating and before preparing meals and after handling raw meat or fish or chicken meat.
In another way, before and after treating a cut or wound: if they bite, after they have touched or swollen your nose, then the proper method of washing your hands, including after touching the waste of animals or after handling animals, and after touching the waste, will need to be used to prevent the spread of disease, including the spread of disease.
In many countries he said, "The measure of washing a low hand with soap is the measure of washing."
According to a 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries, an average of 38.7% of people in the US have the habit of washing at home. A 2014 study of Saudi Arabia shows that it has a higher share of 97 percent. The average number of middle - aged Americans is 77 percent and the lowest in China is 23 percent.
In the Philippines, the “Required Health Care Program” is an example of action to raise children’s health and education.
It is a major measure of this national tax that has been introduced twice in a year by the constant washing of hands by soap and washing, by the constant use of a floridad spraying of teeth.
In Indonesia, it has been successfully applied.
The removal of micro-organisms from the skin is improved by adding water to soaps or liquid soaps.
The main task of soap and liquid cleaners is to reduce and deaden barriers.
The fats and proteins that form the organic soils are not easily removed by water, and they are an inefficient leather cleaner.
However, cleaning is aided by a balanced stream of water....
Dry soap can be reused, and it can contain bacteria derived from previous use.
A few studies that compared the movement of contaminated solid soaps and bacteria have concluded that they do not cause much trouble because they clear the germs of their remains.
The CDC continues to say: “The liquid soap is the best way to distribute hand-controlled controls. ”
Anti-bacterial soaps have been widely promoted in a society that promotes healthy habits.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of antibiotics or antibiotics that are produced chooses the cells that are resistant to antibiotics in nature.
But anti-bacterial soaps contain a common anti-bacterial carrier, such as Tricus, which contains a wide-ranging list of cells.
So, even if some antibiotics are not selected for anti-bacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they thought they would be.
In addition to skin protection, advanced forms may have such as a PH controller, anti-antibiotics, and additional skin freezers (alovera, vitamins, twins, plant constituents) that are as effective as anti-bacterials (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), as the general analysis from the University of Human Health shows.
Heat water is not enough to kill bacteria that are suitable for hand washing.
Bacteria grows very rapidly (37 °C).
However, hot and soapy water is more effective in removing the soil and the natural oils that hold the bacteria than cold, soapy water.
However, contrary to popular belief, as scientific studies show, the use of hot water in our hands has nothing to do with reducing the microbial pressure.
A hand-cleaning or an antiseptic is an alternative that is not based on water.
In the late 1990's and early 21st century, options for non-alcoholic and water-based hand-cleaning (Alco-alcoholic, anesthetic, or hand-cleaning) became popular.
Most of them were designed with a heavy agent, such as a carbomer (occleric acid polymer), to reduce exposure to gel, or to reduce the use of dust and alcohol.
Adding a mixture of hydrogen peroxide increases anti-toasian activity, and at least 60 to 95% of those with alcohol are effective germ killers.
Alcoholism kills bacteria, multidrug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
70% of the alcohol disabling is done in the hands after 30 seconds of hand-on-hand operation, which removes bacteria from hands (3.5 reduction, similar to 35 decibels) 99.97% and between 99.999% and 99.999% (4 to 5 reduction). It removes 7 bacteria from hands by 1 minute.
Alcohol-containing hand-cleanings are not fully effective in eliminating the virus (or, Norwich) that normally causes the most infectious gastrointestinal disease, and hand-washing or alcohol-washed should be used to thoroughly dry or cover both hands.
All fingers receive about 30 seconds of fluid, foam, or gel, until the front and back of all fingers dry.
Both finger ends should be washed thoroughly, with both hands rubbed. The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention advises the use of a handloaf when it is clear that the hand is broken.
The increased use of these agents is based on ease of use and rapid killing of small creatures, but they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Alcohol-based hand-cleanings can cause dry skin if they are not included in the application.
The effect of alcohol drying can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and/or other salinizing oils to the dye.
In clinical trials, alcohol-tolerant toilets have resulted in much less skin anger and drying of soaps or anti-anti-anti-septic soaps.
An allergic reaction to skin disease, bone disease or alcohol intolerance, or the characteristics of alcohol in the handshake, is less likely to be an allergic reaction.
The tendency to touch skin diseases that heal is superior to that of soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless genes do not clean up the hands of organic materials, but they are easily destroyed.
That is why it is said that hand-syntheses are not sufficient to prevent the spread of multi-disease pathogens because they can still be left in the hands.
The effectiveness of the alcohol-free hand sandwiches is mainly based on foods and spices, and they have low levels of alcohol and alcohol.
More recently, it has been shown that with more and less effective benzaquinium chloride (BCF) than alcohol, the effectiveness of benzaquinium chloride (BCF) has been reduced.
Many people in low-income communities are unable to buy soap and replace it with ash or soil.
Soap or soil can be more effective than water, but it can be less effective than soap.
One of the concerns is that soil or ashes can increase the spread of disease rather than reduce the disease contaminated by a microorganism.
Like soap, ash is a pesticide agent because it is a water solution.
When there is no soap, the World Health Organization (WHO) ash or sand is advised as an alternative.
To prevent the spread of disease, the proper hand washing, which is advised by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, includes the following steps:
Let them plow their hands with warm or cold water.
It is the advice of running water, which can be contaminated, which does not seem to cause any difference in the temperature of the water.
They hit the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails with a lot of soap.
Soap removes germs from the skin and people wash their hands thoroughly, as studies show.
Let them seek for at least 20 seconds.
It creates a formula to remove germs from the skin and removes a lot of germs from the smell for a long time.
Let them wash themselves thoroughly in running water.
Washing in a pool can again pollute the hand.
Let them confound themselves with pure cloth, or let it dry with wind.
The wet hands and the flutters are more easily contaminated by germs. The areas most often forgotten are the big toe, the cheek, the middle of the fingers and the bottom of the fingers.
Man’s fragile nails and cleavage of fingernails can cause tiny insects.
To prevent the hands from drying, the use of a washing lot is recommended; dry skin can lead to skin damage that may increase the chance of transmission.
"There may be a variety of low-cost options for the hand-washing of running water and/or soap in areas where there is no room, such as: - "Tipic-taps" and "Tipips" and other small-scale options for water-scaling."
Tip-tape is a simple hand-made technology using a rope and a small amount of water and soap barrel.
Although effective hand drying is an essential part of hand cleaning, there is some debate about the most effective drying in public baths.
The increasing volume of research indicates that paper foil is cleaner than the electric dryers in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted at the University of Westminster in London, supported by a paper sheet industry supported by the European tasis symposium air dryers, the hot air dryers, and the most modern jet air standards.
The total number of bacteria found after washing and drying hands in the hot air increased on average on fingers by 194% and on hands by 254%.
Drying of the jet-air system showed a 42% increase over the average total bacterial count and 15% increase over the fingerpads.
After washing the hands and drying the paper, the total number of bacteria decreased to 76% on average to the size of the fingers and decreased to 77% on the hands. Because of each type of drying method, scientists conducted tests to determine whether other users of the bathroom and the bathroom were likely to pollute the environment.
The air dryer, 180 m/s (650 km/h), was capable of dissolving micro-organisms from the hands and the tool and other users of the bathroom and the bathroom as well as the bathroom at a distance of up to 10 feet (2 m).
The use of a hot air dryer spreads a tiny thawsian from the dryer to a distance of up to six feet [0.25 m].
Paper dryers have shown no signs of the spread of micro-organisms. A number of hand-drying methods were assessed in the 2005 study on T Inside Product Umwalt.
After the hands dry, the following changes have been observed in the bacterial count.
There were many hand dryers, compared with the drying of paper towels.
And it shall be another alternative to wash hand-cleaning when they journey in the absence of soap and water.
Alcohol must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hakim Ignaz Semelwes, a Hungarian, has long been responsible for the prevention of disease in the hospital environment (in 1846).
Hospital workers have electronic devices that remind them to wash when they forget to wash their hands.
With regard to the use of them, he found a study of the extent of disease.
Medical hand-washing is performed for at least 15 seconds and is performed using soap and water or gel to spread and smell each part of the hands.
The hands shall smell with the toes.
If there is refuse in the fingernails, it can be used to remove it.
Since germs may remain in the water in the hands, it is important to clean them thoroughly and dry them with clean cloth.
When it is dried, use a paper towel to close the water (and open any exits as necessary).
This prevents the hands from being contaminated again from those aspects.
"The purpose of hand washing in the environment in health care is to eliminate and prevent the transmissive effects of germs ("germs") related to it."
According to New England’s Journal of Medicine, in most areas, hand washing is considered an unacceptable practice, and a large number of doctors and nurses forget to wash their hands before contacting their patients, thus distributing small cells.
According to one study, the correct hand washing and other simple procedures have reduced the number of blood distributions related to a catheter by 66 percent. WHO published an article showing regular hand washing and hand washing in health - care areas.
The organization’s manual on hand integrity can also be found on the public’s website.
An important valuation was made at the Italian Ital.
If there is a need for a description of the regulation of control, commercial weapons can measure and verify the purity of the hands.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said, "Five times."
After exposure to blood/real liquids
Before pollution is eliminated, and
After the patient's care, the addition of anti-bacterial chemicals to soap ( "sick" or "anti-anti-anti-synthetic" soaps) shows the hygiene of the hand.
This may be necessary prior to the operation of an operation or internal structures in which biotic resistant organisms are very widespread. To perform the operation, you need to have your hands opened and closed, your hands washed, dry towels, some chlorhexidine or iodine, and a dry brush to smell, and other bacterial cleaners.
All of them must go down with ornaments.
This usually requires 2 "6 minutes" to wash hands and wrists up to a cubit.
Long-term search (10 minutes) is not necessary.
And it shall be, when the weaning is in the time of the weaning, that there shall be no water in the weaver, that it be returned into the hands.
After the hand washing is finished, his hands are covered with clean cloth and a surgical coat is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands or use handwashing before and after caring for a sick person.
Hospitals have found that the most important factor in controlling staphylococal infections, hand cleaning, is 20% of the primary use in washing, and hand cleaning increases by more than 35%.
The level of bacterial infectious disease in foods is more than three times higher than in the case of regular soap. On average, the use of hands in an anti-bacterial soap compared with the use of an anti-bacterial soap on an anti-bacterial basis reduces the bacterial pollution by 26% over the anti-bacterial soap.
But H1N1 influenza A virus and chloride diphtheria are more effective than alcohol-based hand cleaners to reduce the virus and chloride. Inhaling interventions to improve hand-cleaning in health institutions can include education for workers, an alcohol-based handwashing, and written and oral notes for workers.
Further research is needed to see which of these interventions is most effective in various health-care settings.
In developing countries, soap washing is seen as a crucial means of salinity, good health, and good nutrition.
However, a lack of safe water supply, soap, or handwashing at people's homes, schools, and workplaces makes global hand washing more challenging.
For example, although there are low-cost options for the construction of hand-washing stations, in most rural Africa there are fewer hand-baths that are close to every private or public toilet.
However, lower hand washing than soap or water shortages can also be the result of recorded practices.
The advertising and teaching of soap and soap can influence the decisions of the police, increase awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to lasting change in the sea for the people.
For this to work effectively, control and evaluation are necessary.
A regular evaluation of 70 studies has found that community-based approaches to hand washing in LMICs are effective and social advertising campaigns are ineffective. One example of the introduction of hand washing in homes is the "third-star presentation" of UNICEF, which encourages students to take less expensive steps to ensure that their hands are washed with soap from other clean standards.
When low standards are met, schools can grow from one to three stars.
Building handshake stations may be a part of campaigns to advertise diseases and children’s deaths.
Another example of the international hand-washing campaign that is trying to bring about marine change is the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) - sponsored by the Coronavirus epidemic of 2019 - 2020.
A few studies estimate the overall cost of washing hands in developing countries in relation to DALYs.
However, one study found that encouraging hand washing with soap is more effective than other water and sanitation measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for injured people, such as the mother of a newborn or hospital patient, is first known in the middle of the 19th century by two hands: Viena, an Hungarian doctor working in Hungary, Ignaz Semmelweis, and "the founder of modern nervous system" Florence Nightingale.
At the time, many people believed that infections were caused by the bad odors known as mayas.
In the 1980 ’ s, food epidemics and health - related infections made the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more conscious of hand hygiene as a crucial way to prevent the spread of the disease.
In 2009, the Swine virus epidemic and the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States helped to increase the awareness in many countries of the need for soap and soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters with "accurate hand washing techniques" were hung near hand-baths near public toilets and buildings and airfields.
For one thing, the phrase “washing the hand ” means to say that he is not willing to take responsibility or to be an accomplice.
In Matthew's Gospel, Pontius Pilate was the author of the Bible in which he had washed his hands from the cross, but in some English communities he was used a broad term.
In Shakespeare’s MacBees, Mrs. McBeth begins to wash her hands vigorously in order to clean up the intended color of her criminal conscience for crimes committed and motivated by her husband.
He also found that people often value washing their hands and washing their hands more than others, remembering or meditating on immoral practices.
Moreover, after such meditation, they are less likely to participate in other "cleaning" measures, such as voluntary hand washing.
Religions require hand washing for clean and meaningful purposes: official hand washing, the use of soap to wash hands, the use of water without hand washing, with many powers, and this is the Baha'i, Hindu, Tevila and Netilia, which includes Islam, in Judaism, in Lavabo and in Islam, especially after all acts have been done.
Hindus, Judaism, and Islam use toilets to wash hands.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require hand washing before and after each meal.
Workplace Danger Control for COVID-19
COVID-19 has the ability to control workplace security techniques for the 2019 Coron and Viral Disease (COVID-19).
The right workplace emergency control is based on the location and nature of the job, and the risk of risk testing of sources, community distribution, and the production of COVID-19 will be determined on the basis of threats
According to U.S. Operational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs are low-risk jobs with community and working partners, which is why basic measures to prevent infection — such as hand washing, if sick — need to be kept in their homes, breathing processes, and routine cleaning and infection removal work.
Middle - risk jobs are people who have direct contact with people who are unknown or suspected of having COVID-19 but who are likely to be contaminated by continuous traffic or international travel.
This includes people from the community, such as a school, those who travel in areas with a high population, and those who go to high places.
This group should be equipped with an emergency control device, a basic immune system, a high - quality air filtering system, and a personal safety device, if the person has COVID-19.
OSHA considers that serious threats to the "known" or suspected person are at high risk of being exposed to COVID-19 or suspected of serious accidents, and when employees conduct air operations, they increase the risk of exposure to COVID-19 from those who are known or suspected of having COVID-19.
For these workers, accurate disaster numbers include engineering controls, such as positive respiratory pressure, and personal protective equipment for their work.
The COVID-19 epidemic can have a powerful impact on the workplace.
Workers may lose their job because of sickness, the fear of injury, and the fear of confrontation.
Businesses may change, which includes what products are needed and how they are purchased (possibly through the use of a small hour or on average by someone who is driving or driving by car).
Finally, high levels of COVID-19 can be hampered by the dispatch of items. The preparedness and response of epidemics can be used to take protective measures.
There are plans that relate to many workplaces and types of work, such as spring vulnerability, threats to the home and the community, as well as the fact that every worker’s fears are related to age-old and serious health problems.
They also explain plans for possible cases of epidemics and epidemics that are necessary to prevent those disasters.
Infectious diseases may be national or regional.
The aims of the epidemic are to reduce labour distribution, to prevent people at risk of health problems, to protect business and to reduce negative impact on other parts of the chain.
In the place where the business is, he shall determine the response of the disease to the seriousness of the disease.
Emergency control systems are effectively used to control safety and group threats.
In places where COVID-19 disasters cannot be avoided, the most effective methods of control are engineering numbers, which are ultimately supported by personal protective devices under administrative control.
Engineering numbers may be a cost-effective method to distinguish workers from work-related accidents, which is not based on the worker's character.
Administrative numbers are a change in employment policies or processes, a change in employment, or a change in employment.
The effectiveness of the Watchtower’s own equipment is less important than engineering and administrative control, but it helps to reduce some conflicts.
All types of personal protective materials must be used on the basis of the worker, as appropriate, the choice (e.g.: filters), the correct and appropriate examination, repair and replacement of personal protective materials, and the proper removal, cleaning, collection, or disposal of pollution.
According to U.S. Official Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs are connected to low-risk communities and other colleagues.
The basic preventive measures for all workplaces are repeatedly and deep, if they are ill, to advise people to stay at home, to cover breathing and breathing, to prepare sophistication and garbage, to be prepared for telephone work and to keep quiet, to encourage workers to refrain from using other people’s weapons and to establish a series of workrooms.
A key step in protecting workers, customers, and others in the workplace is to identify quickly and put individuals who may have been contaminated.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) need to stay at home until they are 24 hours late, but they must not use any medication that reduces or alters any of the symptoms.
According to OSHA, mid-risk jobs are often close - knit, up to six feet (1.8 m) in length, where people who are suspected of or have no COVID-19 need close jobs, but who have recently traveled in a country with a high level of COVID-19 distribution, which is likely to be caused by the continued transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
This includes school, high population levels, and other high-tech shop operators. This includes employees connected to these and high-risk groups, encouraging high-risk groups to remain in the home of workers with high-risk engineering numbers, changing air quality, breathing levels, deciding on a regular skiff, setting up non-essential trips and stopping traffic out of COVID-19, emergency planning, responding to these and high-risk groups on job-related threats, and changing face-to-face meetings on security issues, training, protective clothing and equipment and how to use them in such a way that they need to stop non-essential trips from the premises created by COVID-19, emergency planning, emergency planning, response to the threat of work-related for these groups, and the protection of the privacy of the COVID-19, and the security of the COVID-19 sections and the protection of the privacy of the front and security of the environment.
The workers of this threat group rarely use their breaths.
To protect the sick workers and other passengers on the plane, a person must be able to distinguish the sick person from a distance of 6 feet, to serve the sick person, and to give him a front leg to the front of the plane.
When flying workers are host to a sick passenger, or when they have touched discharges or contaminated bodies, they must drown a single-use reservoir, and the sick traveler must use an additional personal security device if he has a persistent fever, cough, or breathing problem.
Gloves and other things that can be disposed of should be placed in a biohazard bag and then cleaned and contaminated. When commercial operators, including ships and other passenger ships, are sick, they include moving for a while, isolation and alerting. If there is a fire or other signs on the ship, immediately inform the medical center on the ship.
The best way to do this is to have it done in the room of the person who has been given specific health care. The CDC advises short-term closure and clean-up or clean-up of infection if the contaminated person has entered a school building and social distribution.
When there is low to middle social distribution, such as the cancellation of travel programs, the dispersal of meetings, and other activities such as school attendance, the cessation of assemblies held in the state of Quair or cathedral, the expansion of the distance between borders, the change of arrival and take-off hours, the prohibition of non-essential visitors and the identification of private offices for children showing the mark.
In addition to social isolation, long-term school closures can be seen as an option in the community.
Law enforcement officials who have to contact individuals arrested or suspected of being arrested on COVID-19 are advised to follow similar guidelines, such as emergency medical techniques, including proper personal protective equipment.
If a close relationship occurs during a difficult hour, employees should clean their work belts and devices with spray or wipes before using household appliances, and must keep and remove PPE used for the operation they are in place.
OSHA shows that some health care and cremation workers are at high or very high risk of being exposed.
Works at high risk are vulnerable to health care, support, labyrinth and known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This is a serious threat, and workers work with workers who work on aerosol - producing processes or who suspect samples of COVID-19 patients.
Air-scaling procedures, ventilation, salinization, bronchoscopy, and some dental procedures and examinations or protective meetings.
Highly sensitive cremation tasks include the work of covid-19-hourly cremation workers who are suspected of having been killed by COVID-19, and the manufacture of autopsies from Hanun means that these people are highly vulnerable.
A special negative face breath assistant may be needed for some health care or for a dead body.
Samples need to be taken at biosecurity level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) advises patients to stay in a limited storage area on the basis of suspected COVID-19: In addition to PPE, they are suspected to be six feet away and to use OSH-CoV-2 in combination with people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those who work in small - sized air vents.
In the United States, NIOSH has permitted the breathing of the N95 frontal gland, or should be used in an overall manner, a written respiratory protection program that includes an assessment of fitness, training, and health examinations.
Other types of breathing devices provide great protection and increase working comfort. WHO does not fully support coverage, and COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, which is transmitted by body fluids.
WHO recommends that only workers who check the entrances should have a repair lock.
It advises COVID-19 patients to use the presence of people who take care of the COVID-19 or of patients who do not take off the air, WHO sergical machin, an anaesthetic or front shelter, and side effects.
From the operation of the air conditioning process, the spine will be replaced by N95 or FFP2.
With regard to the global inadequate supply of PPE, WHO points out that the reduction of PPE needs is due only to people who have to take direct care of telemedicines, physical limits, i.e. by means of clean windows, to use personal protective materials only for one limited operation, and to people who do not have access to personal protective equipment without having to take out a breathing device, to provide personal protective materials, to control chains and to show signs.

Issue: [Covid-19] To ease the burden and prepare for the future
Date/time dispatch: March 14/2020, 00:24 UTC
Authorization holder: CC0: No legal right
In this month we have found ourselves in a different situation.
The COVID-19 epidemic has made our human relationship clear, and it is an indication of the seriousness we have for each other.
Although we do not have an example of his duties, our best response is to achieve universal commitment, cooperation, and community-building in this centrally located organization.
The friendship we have seen on e-mails, phone calls, and chat rooms among our employees is an assurance of how we can be able to work with the greatest of the wonderful people.
I consider myself worthy to know you all as a fellow worker.
Last week someone told me how much he appreciated our good news.
How meaningful it is for us to return to Wikipedia and this crucial goal to be on-line and to all people is a big sign.
This will be your job, if you take the place, if our colleagues are paid or if our community is safe.
Now, as never before, Wikipedia is looking for information.
This is not only what we do but also how we do it.
This mission and your role is so important that we will have to make some major adjustments to how we work together since the coming week.
Adjustments in Our Conduct and Life - Style
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the C-group met last night to discuss our steps and programmes for the coming days and months.
In that talk, we have been thinking about what will be the right answer to what we face and what we will do to make our organization continue.
We wanted to remove great anxiety and to continue our mission for a long time.
If they want to call back, there's no problem.
All employees, workers and temporary workers:
The hour of work required of us skill shall be four hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until the time is clear in the future.
We don't say it's a vacation time — if they can follow the normal working hours and work extra hours, you can benefit from the mission.
But it is impossible to imagine where you are going now, and if you need to take care of your family, go to a store, or go to a nursing home, your security is our priority.
We will not follow your watch.
If you believe it, don't work.
This is not necessary, but we will say to him.
No sick day or PTO is required - to inform the management employee and only to ensure that your teams have key work parts covering by reviewing calendars and manuals.
(If the outcome of the Covid-19 tests is positive, please provide support and assure Brian that your administration has given you the proper attention.)
Men shall be paid in full every hour.
And before we said so, we continue to give what we have to our contractors and Avat workers.
Every man shall be paid in the hour of their regular work.
And if they cannot lay the foundation for sickness, it shall include it.
If they want to work, we'll help you.
Many people use work to pass on their anxieties around them without delay.
The work we do can have great results, especially at such times.
This is again about caring for yourself.
Our question is, What should we wait for and what we can do to prepare by speaking with the governor?
Some tasks are considered necessary.
There are some things we need to continue to do.
SRE, HR, forgett and security and fund-raising groups (from among others) perform a crucial task that may require additional support.
In all parts of the world, we start a process that will allow us to do what is right now and to focus on what is necessary for our family.
We all have a lot of work to do, and we all focus on what we really need.
Delays are no longer harmful.
We don't plan to double the working hours to complete any delayed tasks after this epidemic has passed.
They do not currently expect him to work overtime to meet unrealistic limits.
We accept that things have changed, and we work to keep new ones and time lines in place.
What happens to the APP?
To adapt to our new reality and working hours, we need to adjust our 2020-2021 calendar plan to succeed.
Almana is asked to extend our plan of 2019 - 2020, which gives workers the order in which they are required to take care of themselves, their families, and so on. This will satisfy the needs of those who want to set less hours.
This extension of time significantly reduces the current planning pressure and pressure on the entire organization.
The following week, we will inform our staff of the Board, and we will let representatives and groups know immediately what the next level is as soon as we have received the information.
We are now grateful for the guidance of the APP group.
Office conditions, conflicts, and cleaning
Last week, we discovered that one of our colleagues, who had founded the SF, may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, from a high level of caution, we hired workers to the San Francisco office.
They have freed each hospital bed from infection, using a combination of the virus used to remove the virus, including its host and our server banks.
The building is built by using products that protect the security of tenants.
When we decide to return, we have faith that the office will be fully prepared.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, and they have shared the COVID-19 process with our DCs.
Over the past week, I have followed Sanfrancescu's direction to start our D.C. office entirely from house to house.
As some of our NYC employees know, we are also giving a rent talk in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but they can be delayed.
Some of our fellow workers are working from their own house for the first time.
They know that long - term colleagues can make adjustments, and they want to give you some advice:
The length of the meetings shall be limited to one or two hours.
If longer periods are needed, consider how it can be done for many days to divide small periods.
Make the meeting clear, have an agenda and send in advance the reading materials.
Make video durable, which includes such devices as Google Docs and Zoom, which promotes direct cooperation and communication.
There should be a person who conducts each meeting, controls the chat rooms, and helps to get a list of speakers and notes (or notes taken in collaboration).
If they want a suitable earphone, send an e-mail to support technology.
Let them use thy security charges for the profit of accusations.
They will mix #remotes channel to discuss existing tasks with your colleagues
With the guidance of the Ergonomees, which was based on the Webbinar, the Human Helicopter Group is looking for ways to handle the ever-increasing work in the founder.
Last week, we asked community aid recipients to cancel their participation in the Wikimedia Fund, who are like Edittons, and this is until the WHO tells us that the epidemic is over.
We have taught them that we understand that we can make it difficult for them to meet the previously agreed relief agreement, and no one will be punished for delaying or changing these goals.
In the coming week, we will have an additional guide cell, Wikamania, and other regional and limited social conferences.
Not only is the quality of the international community a matter of sadness but it is also a relief because of the clear vision of the community, the Wikimedia, and others who are focused on the crisis.
In our discussion of the future, CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki, and the mother-in-law is able to control the pressure on the community and to maintain contact with them.
Keeping a Close Look at Things Related to COVID-19
Next Thursday 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for the Special Workers' Meeting.
We use this time to share new information, answer your questions, and destroy our relationship.
We are here together, and we help as much as we can.
At this time, you can find information about this e-mail and other COVID-19-related information on the Office Wiki.
CRT enables these pages to be at the same location as all the new information.
In addition, we are working to maintain contact with the labour force, and this is for those in the most affected countries.
If you need help with travel, arrival, main line of work or covert duty, or any other matter, please do not speak with them in order to inform CRT and work with them.
We are here to provide support and to fulfill it as necessary.
If there is a need to be careful about secret wine, let the Bryan Judan-man's mail be sent to the director of the operation.
None of these changes should be seen as having failed us.
But at this time it is recognized that our deeds and our idols ought to be corrected in a way we have not seen before.
One step is to support each other and to support each other so that we can continue to work together, to support our activities, and to provide the services we need to support each other.
Our appointed foundation will be our watch at the right time.
Now is the time to support one another and create open places for the next few weeks and months to come.
All of you are crucial for this to be true, and all of you want to protect yourself and your families better when necessary.
Now, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Catherine CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, James V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), as well as the steering group (Grant I, Heather W, Jamie V, Janen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
An enzyme (ACE2) contains an enzyme in the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 makes it a promising drug target for treating the disease of the blood vessels by reducing the amount of Angola-II and by adding Ang (1-7) to the activity of a related neurotensin converting enzyme (ACE). ACE2 serves as a starting point for some of the viruses to cells.
The enzyme in man is also often referred to as hace2.
Angrostin-enzyme 2 is a zinc containing iron on the floor of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein is assigned to the N-terminal peptidase M2 gora and C-terminal colectrin renal amino acid-transmitting group.
ACE2 is once a transmissible type I, and it is on the floor of the lungs and other internal parts of the body because of the enzyme’s alert domain.
ACE2 is cut off from the inside of the cell by another enzyme, called shedas, which is released into the circulation of the blood and finally forms into the urine as a dying protein.
ACE2 is found in most parts of the body: ACE2 is mainly in the lungs of type II alveolar cells, in most parts of the intestines, in the blood vessels, and in the blood vessels of the blood vessels, which are made up of soft muscle cells.
ACE2 mRNA is an explicit Serbian cortex, stratrum, hypothalamus, and brain cells.
The main act of ACE2 is to be a relative balance for ACE2.
ACE angiotensin I binds to vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 breaks down amino acid phenylalanine (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and makes it hydrolyse (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH) hydrolyse.
ACE2 can destroy [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, aplein, neurotensin, dinorphin A and grelin.
ACE2 also controls the transporter, SLC6A19, and has been known to be involved in prayer.
Like transmembrene protein, ACE2 is used as the primary entry point for certain corals and viruses for cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that creates SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)
Especially, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 allow S1 cell droplets to be attached to the ACE2 enzyme cell and the enzymes to the enzyme in the cells.
This introduction process, which is currently based on research, has led some to think that it can help fight the infection by reducing the ACE2 level in the cell.
But a number of professional communities and control bodies advise that the formal ACE inhibitor and ARB should continue their treatment.
According to a strategic evaluation and analysis published by the USA on July 11, 2012, the use of ACE agencies compared with controls had a 34% reduction in the incidence of pneumonia.
"The risk of lung infection was also similar to that of patients treated with ACE influenza, which was highly susceptible to pneumonia, particularly those in the brain and heart attack.
ACE’s use of murderers has also been used in connection with the death of neomony, and its effects have been lower than that of the whole of Namibia. ”
Mankind’s ACE2 (rhACE2) cell is estimated to be a new treatment for urgent pneumonia, and the respiratory problem caused by liposcarid respiratory failure improves the release of pneumonia and oxygen on the axens.
Man’s rhACE2 half life is about 10 hours, and the beginning of the process is in addition to 24 hours (time) and 30 minutes.
According to many findings, it can be a promising medicine for diseases with elevated rhACE2 classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors). It has been evaluated in clinical trials to treat severe respiratory stress.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications designed to help track or search for people who may have contact with the infected person.
A number of applications have been prepared or made with the help of public government support in certain government departments and territories.
Several sections have been prepared to build up communication tracking.
In particular, there have been personal concerns about the principles established to monitor geographical location.
A small intervention option includes using the Ethiopian symbols to register the user in close proximity to other mobile phones.
In April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they were working together to work together on the tools of the Olympics and to work together in Android and iOS printing systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has set up a telephone service to inform citizens of COVID-19.
More than 200 Chinese cities have been employed.
It is an open-source community built in the environment, and it is given to the government "Stokoruna in Northern Macedonia to pursue confrontation with people infected with the disease and to respond quickly"
The application is made by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since 14 April 2020, its application has been waiting for permission to sit in Google Play Story and Apple App Store.
"A.A. April 12 days states that the government's search for knowledge is at a high level of progress, and within weeks it will start work similarly in Ireland and France ("StopCovid")."
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the project of tradeTogether and BlueTrace, in Singapore. Russia intends to introduce to the COVID-19 patients in Moscow to the application of geofensing.
Ros Anderson, professor of safety engineering at Cambridge University, listed many problems, including the fact that the use of lying results and practices is restricted to a small part of the population.
"Stupid or harmful" "coronavirus" applications have set limits on the use of apple in which types of organization can be used to solve threats, which would limit it only to "ordinary" or "ordinary" organisations.
Google and Amazon have followed similar limits.
Personal rights defenders expressed concern about the implications of extensive surveillance of the koruna virus, especially the fact that the foundation for the fight against the global epidemic of the koruna virus has been broken once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for limits on such surveillance.
The organizations have announced eight cases on government projects:
"Furthers must be "legal, necessary and compatible":
The lengths of control and surveillance shall be a female paragraph;

This means that they are useful beyond the disease they are immune to.
A further examination is seeking to register 4,170 health - care workers in Australia.
Vaccines in progress may not be safe or effective.
Research into the efficacy of COVID-19-related animal models shows that there is a need for time using living bio-security viruses, and that there is an unprecedented cooperation for the use of standard safety procedures, such as ACE2 transgenic rats, other experimental animals, and other non-human monkeys.
The vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
Until 2020, there will be no medication or vaccine for SARS, which has seen its safety and effectiveness in humans.
Based on research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the U.S.
At the time of MERS’ illness, he was convinced that the current SARS research could prepare a useful measure vaccine and bring about a treatment for MERS-CoV.
March 2020 was the completion of one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine in humans, and three others in progress, all of which were viral vaccines, two equivalent-tortures (ChAdox1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media styles have raised the idea that there is a conspiracy that requires virus from the back of COVID-19 and a known vaccine already exists.
Texts from various social media websites point to the possession of innovative record-keeping documents, such as SARS Coronavirus, for other gonads and vaccines.
Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a infectious disease caused by a serious respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common signs include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from the onset of symptoms to the next five days may range from two to forty - four days.
Although most of the issues have a milder symptoms, some improvements have been made to the lungs and the large body parts of the virus.
Since April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in over 210 countries and states, and more than 153,000 have been killed.
More than 568,000 people have recovered from the disease, mainly by sneezing, painting, or talking about the virus during human relationships.
These droplets come out when they breathe, and often they fall on the ground or on a body rather than on long distances.
Humans can also touch contaminated land by touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can last up to 72 hours in dry areas.
In the first three days after the onset of symptoms, the symptoms are highly contagious, although they can be transmitted from the nasoparengel (rRT-PCR) before and after the onset of the disease.
Those who doubt that we have the virus are advised to use the veils of their caregivers.
Advice for the use of the public at large may differ, some authorities advise them to indicate their use, others to use, and others to use.
At present, there is no vaccine or special antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
The spread of the disease has been recorded in most territories of the World Health Organization (WHO).
People infected with the virus may be symptoms of flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue and respiratory failure.
Emergency symptoms include respiratory problems, constant chest pain or pressure, confusion, resuscitation, and the color of the face or lips. If these symptoms appear, medical attention is advised immediately.
The symptoms of upper respiratory organs are often seen as sneezing, nasal or sore throat.
Signs of stomach symptoms, such as nausea, nausea and vomiting, have been seen throughout the century.
In China some issues were first addressed only in the form of closures and disabilities.
In some cases, the disease can lead to lung disease, body organs and death.
This shall be called the time of the sight of the disease.
COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can be two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who show signs show signs within 11.5 days of the date of infection.
The role of those who fail to show these signs in the spread has not yet been fully understood, but if the first evidence indicates they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The number of people who do not show symptoms is now unknown and is being studied, and as reported by the KCDC, 20 percent of the cases found are not known at the hospital.
The National Commission of Health of China included first issues, including personal matters, on April 1, 130 (78%) of the 166 infections of that day were of the same kind during the test.
Both can carry large-scale viral loads.
Singing out loud brings out more drops than normal.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered salinity results in droplets up to 15 feet (15 feet) below the ground.
Although the virus is not generally air-generated, the National Academy of Sciences has been able to transmit bioaerosol and aircrews have been able to give positive results to the HIV virus on its extra-human route.
Some medical processes, such as machiking and heart pressure (CPR), can cause respiratory breath to enter the air and spread through air.
It is believed that this risk is low, despite threats that can be spread on average. The virus is highly contagious when people show symptoms.
While the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is not as clear as the spread of the disease itself, one person, in general, pollutes two to three others. The virus lives for hours and days in dry areas.
The virus was particularly detected in the Card Board for up to one day in plastics (polypphylin) and iron (AISI 304) and up to 99% in copper.
This, however, varies according to the amount of moisture and temperature.
Soap products lower, destroy, and free them from skin and other materials.
Other solutions, such as benzalkinium chloride and chlohedidin gluconate (an antisurgery), were not effective. In the Hong Kong study, two days after hospital treatment began, intermediate samples were taken.
The first of the six patients showed the highest viral load in the five; the sixth showed the highest viral load on the second day.
A serious emergency respiratory disease of the Corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new major emergency respiratory disease of the colona virus. First in the water, people who are isolated from a serious respiratory disorder of the three people are associated with the lung disease.
The NOVEL SARS-CoV-2 virus all properties occur in natural chronavirides.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by a home soap, and it breaks the protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the first SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most harmful parts of the COVID-19, because the virus is found in the lungs by the host cells of the most frequent of the II alveolar cells, the enzyme enzyme enzyme enzyme enzyme (ACE2).
To meet ACE2 and enter the host cell, the virus uses a special form of peploomer (peplomer).
The most frequent cases of heart attack were the 12 percent of those who were admitted to the hospital in the water, China.
During the development of the disease, the symptoms of cardiovascular syndrome are high because of the strategic response and immune system problems, but serious myocardial injury is related to ACE2 recipients in the heart.
ACE2 recipients are shown in a high degree in the heart and participate in the work of the heart.
In COVID-19 patients with COVID-19 infections, there was a high blood pressure (31%) and a hormonal reabsorbing gland (25%), and they could also be related to a poor prostate.
Although SARS-COV-2 has an effect on the respiratory tract, it has signs of artificial blood pressure in patients with severe COVID-19.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-confidential T-cells have been shown to be connected to the development of mononotes and severe pulmonary pathology caused by the N-6-intestination of COVID-19 patients.
Lymphatic infections have also been reported on my remains.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a number of test protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is an instant-correct polymers response chain (rRT-PCR).
The test is carried out on breath samples held in a nasopharyngeal swab, but a sample of the nasal gland or acta can also be used.
The results shall be within a few hours, even two days.
Blood tests may be used, but these two weeks apart require two samples of blood, and the results are of little value.
Chinese scientists have been able to publish a series of tests (PCR) to enable the labs worldwide to develop independent polymersson (PCR) tests in order to investigate infections infected with the virus.
Since April 4, 2020, anti-viral tests (which can detect infections and if a person had previously been infected) have been in progress, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese’s experience with the investigation shows that only 60 to 70% are accurate.
At the end of the month, the US FDA U.S.A. approved the test for initial testing on March 21st, which indicated ways to detect infections in clinical behavior and influenza.
Two-story, two-story ground-glass spaces are common in the past, with back, back and back distribution.
The prevalence of sub-malarial superiority, crazy tumors (with changing alveolars) and the strengthening of the Lombular Capital can be seen as the disease gets worse.
There is little information about microcalibres and the process of changes in COVID-19.
A major pathological examination of corpses:
macrocoupe-pleurisy, pericarditis, pneumonia and pneumonia
Four types of pneumonia can be known:
Lower pneumonia: pneumonia, hyperplasia, worm bites, lymphoseptics, and the formation of a large cell in the middle of the lungs
A severe lung disease (DDA) is spreading with the spread of alveolar oxidase.
DAD is a cause of severe respiratory problems (ARDS) and severe hypothermia.
The cure of pneumonia: Alveolar pits exposes the lungs to a central rudimentary fracture
blood:-extended intravascular blood coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic response
Protective measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, removing crowded areas, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and maintaining good respiratory control and keeping your eyes, nose, or mouth clean.
The CDC recommends using the interior of the cervix if there is no nasal cord or nasal cord when they are bitten or dislocated by the CDC.
It shall be advised to do right, after any boiling, or smoldering, and to do right.
The CDC advises the use of front covers in public organizations to limit the spread of the disease to those who carry the disease. Social exclusion strategies are a strategy that helps reduce contact with infected people in large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and eliminating major public meetings.
Remote instructions include keeping people at least 6 feet (1.8) apart.
"No medicine is known to be effective in preventing COVID-19. As the vaccine is not expected until 2021, COVID-19 is trying to reduce the epidemic of the disease, known as "prolonging the spread of the virus".
The CDC also advises individuals to wash their hands in soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially when they go to the bathroom or when their hands are clearly dirty, before and after touching the nose and squeezing or eating.
Only when soap and water are not readily available does WHO recommend the use of an alcohol-based hand wash containing at least 60% alcohol. It has offered two formulas for environmental production in areas where hand-snitezers are not available.
Anti-toasian activity is derived from itanol or isosophanole in these formulas.
The hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacteria from the glands in alcohol, which is “not an active substance by the hand of antypsy”.
Glycerol is like a humectant.
People apply liquid medicine, oxygen support, and other essential organs affected, as well as financial support that can be used to support them.
The CDC advises those who believe that they have a virus to wear a light frontal fin.
Ephroacler’s membrane has been used for oxygen (ECMO) to solve respiratory problems, but benefits are still being seen.
To improve the prevention of disease, they promote personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet.
Supportive treatments for people with mild first symptoms may be useful. WHO and China’s National Health Commission have issued plans to care for hospitalized people on COVID-19.
Doctors and doctors of the U.S. respiratory system who treat patients have respected medical advice from various genes to use IBCC as a free source.
There is no special treatment for COVID-19 until April 2020.
For tests, some physicians advise on the abuprofen papatamol (acmenonone) to use the first line of service.
When performing air - generated procedures, such as subcellulars or air - vents, care must be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus.
In addition to using regular precautionary measures, precautionary measures, and air precautions, CDCs who take care of people with COVID-19 advise that the person be placed in the air-borne infection escape department (IIR).
The advised March: PPE clothing, respiratory or facial features, eye protection, and side care. Also, breathings are preferred (more than the front cover) when found.
N95 breath weapons have been approved for industry groups, but FDA has allowed them to be used under emergency licenses (EUA).
They are designed to protect from air particles, such as dust, but the effectiveness of a specific biological agent does not guarantee a service outside the product description.
When there are no skirts, the CDC recommends that they use frontal shields or that they use homemade skirts as a last resort.
The majority of COVID-19 injuries are not as serious as the need for both mechanical air transport and wine options, but the small number of injuries are very small.
For individuals with respiratory problems related to COVID-19, respiratory activity is being actively studied in the hospital, and the symptoms can be eliminated by a high flow of nose or a positive two - step air pressure.
It is not known whether one of these will bring the same benefit to his chronic illness.
Because some doctors limit the distribution of air particulates compared to a higher nasal vent, some doctors choose a mechanical respiration device when they are available. They are most common among adults over 60 years of age, especially over 80 years of age.
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per soul, which has limited the ability of the health system to control the sudden increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who need hospitalized care.
A survey in China revealed that 5% of the population in high-care schools needed air park support, and 1.4% died.
In China, 30% of those in the hospital who were caught in COVID-19 enter the ISS.
As the emergency respiratory syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and becomes more difficult, mechanical air becomes more complex.
Air pressure control plants that add to conditions and high PEEP need to increase oxygen supply when they reduce respiratory and respiratory damage.
There may not be a high level of PeEP on any of the remaining air ventilators.
The study of possible treatments was launched in January 2020, and a number of antiviral medicines are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems very promising.
Although they may take new medicines to develop by 2021, many of the drugs under examination have already been approved for other uses or are already under high-risk scrutiny.
Antivirus drugs can be tested against people with severe disease.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed to participate in efficiency and safety experiments on good and effective medical methods, and the FDA granted temporary FDA permission when the individual’s life was in serious or immediate danger.
He did not examine the clinical studies needed to show that the disease was healthy and effective.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile operation to cope with the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and identification number.
The application can be used to access 'close contact' information, so it varies the risk of being exposed to the disease.
Each user can also examine the situation of other three users.
If an accident occurs, its application not only alerts environmental health authorities to isolation but also alerts them to face-to-face analyses of mobile phones, facial recognition technology, cell phone surveillance and the intelligence of people infected with the disease. It has been found in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
March 2020 enabled the Government of Israel to trace mobile phone information to people who were thought to be infected by the Koruna virus.
It has been taken to identify and protect those who are related to the disease.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also shared information with Robert Koch Institute, a federal government agency of Germany, on a strengthened telephone environment to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has applied facial recognition technology to identify escapeors.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Galera has announced that “40% of people have continued to move in any way, ” says mobile phone operators.
The German government conducted a 48-hour study on Saturday and Sunday with over 42,000 participants.
Also, President Kersty Kaljulid of Estonia has made an international call for innovative solutions to the spread of the Coron virus.
Individuals may be subjected to isolation, travel restrictions, side effects of medicine or the threat of infection.
BBC Rory O'Connor reported that “social isolation, loneliness, health distress, stress and economic collapse are a complete wave that harms people's mental health and well-being”.
Other common respiratory symptoms, such as common common colds, can take a lower course without seeing a few or any signs.
Lower issues usually recover within two weeks, but serious or serious illnesses can take from three to six weeks to recover.
Based on similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, expectant women may be more likely to be infected with severe infections for COVID-19, but for COVID-19 without information. In some people, COVID-19 may result in pneumonia.
In the most affected, COVID-19 is a rapid respiratory problem, which results in a sudden breakdown of the respiratory system (ARDS).
The problems associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, unhealthy abdominal cord and heart, kidney and liver.
Unhealthy diets, especially the increase in prostate time, 6% of those who went to the hospital in connection with COVID-19, and an unusual kidney function was seen in 4% of this group.
An estimated 20 to 30% of people close to COVID-19 show elevated liver enzymes (transmines).
According to the same report, the average time between the first symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were spent in the hospital.
But patients who moved to ICU had an average of seven days between hospital beds and death.
In the past, there were about 14 days in the six - to 41 - day period, from the mid - middle of the study of the early signs to the death.
In a study conducted by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, there was an increase of 2.8% in the deaths of men and 1.7% in the deaths of women.
The historical examination of the lungs shows damage to both lungs by the detection of cellular fibroxide.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed on neocytes.
The emergency image of the lungs seems to be the AARDS.
In China, among the deaths reported by the National Health Commission, it has been reported to be 11.8%, a heart disease with high heart rate, or a heart condition.
According to data from the United States in March, 89 percent of those in the hospital had pre-existing conditions: the existence of mental and physical disorders, the social and economic impact of the region, and death.
Death is different because of these regional differences, but it can also be caused by salaried problems.
He may count the number of deaths by counting the minimum.
But since death is caused by past events, the current level of death is estimated to be low.
Smokers may be more than 1.4 times more likely to have serious symptoms than COVID-19, and compared to cigarette smokers, they may need some care or approximately 2.4 times more.
The Hong Kong Hospital official found that the lung capacity had been reduced from 20% to 30% in some people who recovered from the disease, and that the body was injured by a scan.
This can lead to symptoms of disease after recovery.
It is not known that, until March 2020, the United Nations will provide effective and long-term resistance to those who will be cured of the disease.
The incidence of the disease is based on the nature of another virus, but positive tests of the virus have been reported after the recovery of COVID-19.
It is believed that these issues will get worse rather than worse.
The virus is thought to be a natural and animal source of infection by natural means.
The exact origin is unknown, but the spread of infection will be fully transmitted from person to person by December 2019.
The first 41 confirmed studies of COVID, published in Lanet in January 2020, indicate that the day of the onset of symptoms is December 1, 2019.
The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that the first symptoms have occurred since December 8th, 2019.
Various steps have been taken together to measure the amount of death.
These numbers vary according to age and age, and they influence the degree of experience, the quality of health care, the options for medicine, the first epidemic, and the general nature of society, such as age, sex, and health.
By the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by Labratori gave the emergency ICD-10 code U07.1 and SARS-CoV-2 to the clinical or related disease study code U07.2, which reflects the number of people diagnosed in a specific time-space combination of deaths.
According to Johns Hopkins University Statistics, since April 17, 2020 the worldwide death toll has been 6.9% (153,822 2,240,191).
The number varies in number, and other steps include one-hundredth (patients and untreated) of individuals who have been diagnosed with the disease, and one-hundredth of those who die of the disease.
And these statistics are not limited to a certain time limit until they have decided on the issue of vaccination.
Although not all people are infected with the disease, the existence of anti-foreign systems can provide information on how many people are infected with the disease.
80 (1.7%) people died in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with 4600 inhabitants at the centre of the epidemic in Italy.
The disease spread in Bangladesh through the Carneval arrangements, and the relatively small death to young people, so the deaths of COVID-19 may not have been regularly assigned to them.
In addition, the German health system did not go too far.
As estimated by blood donors, 3% of the Netherlands may have antibodis.
69 (0.004% of the population) has been found to be dead from COVID-19.
The magnitude of the epidemic is different for men and women.
In China and Italy, the death toll is high.
The greatest danger for men is in their 50 ’ s, and the gap between men and women is close to 90.
In China, men's deaths were 2.8 percent and women 1.7 percent.
The true causes of this gender difference are unknown, but they can be one reason for race, race, and the sea.
In contrast to women and men, the incidence of death in men, such as low blood pressure, can be a factor in increasing the level of death rate.
In Europe, 57% of those infected are men, 72% are men who died of COVID-19.
Until May 2020, the US government is not following the sexual information related to COVID-19 infections.
Studies show that men and women, such as Ibola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, are different.
A large number of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) will be named "COVID-19" on February 11, 2020.
The World Health Organization (WHO) director general, Theodore Adhanum, said that carbon Corona, the virus, the disease, and 19 people were first identified when the disease epidemic was identified: December 31/2019.
In line with international advice to prevent discrimination, his name was chosen for a specific geographical area (e.g. China), to prevent the beavers of animals or groups of people. The COVID-19 virus is called a major emergency respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses the term “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus” in public media.
"The disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coron and virus".
The virus and its disease were commonly referred to as “coronavirus” and “Wohanas virus” in water, where China was the first to occur.
In January 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) advised that in 2020-nCov and 2019-nCoV, emergency respiratory disease should serve as temporary names for the virus and the virus, according to the 2015 directive.
The name COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 was February 11, 2020.
Because of the limitations of the regular supply chains, some digital producers are printing health-care materials, such as nasal glands and air - conditioning cells.
In one example, when an Italian hospital was able to deliver as much time as the provider could, the first one day of one night, the first one was printed with the 100 Valvotes needed by the mine nurse.
From the time of the rise of COVID-19, the origins of the disease, balance, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease have been spread quickly on the Internet.
It seems that people have the ability to spread the virus to other animals.
The study did not find evidence of virus proliferation in pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is no medicine or vaccine to treat the disease.
On the COVID-19, an international research on vaccines and medicines is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
With the most effective promise of the World Health Organization in March, the World Health Organization (WHO) set up a “Solidarity Test ” to evaluate the effects of four new antibiotics.
There is no vaccine, but various genes are actively developing vaccine candidates.
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have already been used in SARS-CoV because both use an ACE2 receiver to enter cells.
Three methods of vaccination are under investigation.
First, researchers aim to create an overall virus vaccine.
If this virus is used, alert or dead, the human body is responding to a new COVID-19 immune response.
A second strategy, a sub-vaccination, is aimed at creating a vaccine that detects immune systems in certain parts of the virus.
On the subject of SARS - CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the ACE2 virus host.
The third method is a new method for creating DNA or RNA vaccines.
Test vaccines should be tested for safety and efficacy. The first clinical trial of vaccinations in Cytyl for 16 days 2020 was started on four volunteers.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code derived from the virus that exposes it to the disease. It has been presented as an susceptible anti-personnel antibody to the SARS-COV-2 vaccine preparation, but this is controversial.
More than 300 clinical experiments have been under way since April 2020.
The previously approved treatments for malaria, including four approved studies, including seven hydrochloroquin or chloroquine, were under review.
Most of the re-used anti-viral drugs do Chinese research, which was reported in April at the end of nine chapters III in several countries.
At the end of the year 2020, clinical development of COVID-19 and the clinical development of candidates for drugs was conducted. REFLOVIRE, Chloroquin and Hydrochlorokine, LOPEVIA / RUTANAVIRE and LOPENAVIR/RUDONAVIR, with their home, are evaluating a number of long-term antiviral medicines for COVID-19.
There is real evidence of cost-effectiveness up to March 2020.
Clinical improvement was seen in patients who were treated in a compassionate-use storage facility.
Clinical experiments are under way in the United States, China, and Italy, where Chlorokine, who had previously been used to treat malaria, was first studied in China in February 2020.
However, calls have been made for an evaluation of research.
Korea and China’s health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology has indicated that, although it is recommended to take one gram a day, it can be extremely dangerous and deadly twice a day.
On March 28, 2020, the choice of doctors for people on COVID 19 issued a permit for the use of hydroclotin and chloroxine. In addition to the 7th Chinese edition, the instructions for the use of intervion, Rivavirin, or Umphenoviran include the use of COVID-19.
According to the initial data, the high levels of Rivavirin SARS-CoV-2 are necessary to control the vitreousity of the SARS-CoV-2.
After showing low pressure concentration for SARS-CoV-2, Nitazoxanide was advised to be used as an add-on to the Vivo study. Studies have shown that the high protein consumption of TMPRSS 2 is essential for the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to the ACE2 recipient.
Chloroquine and hydrochlorochlorine with or without arthromycin have major limits that the community has found not to host these treatments without further study. Oseltamivir does not inherit SARS-CoV-2 in Vitro and has no role in the COVID-19 treatment.
In later stages of massive COVID-19, the sytokine storm can be complex.
After a small study, Tocilizumab has been incorporated into the National Commission of Health in China into medical guidelines.
An unexpected 2nd national experiment is taking place in Italy after he has shown good results for people with serious illness.
In order to identify the Yutokin storm, it is intended to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death on the part of those who have been injured.
Interleukin-6 was relatively acceptable to the FBI based on studies based on the recovery of tytotoxin viral syndrome, published in 2017 in CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no controlled information that Toklizi has permitted CRS to be an effective treatment.
The investigation is being carried out that patients who recover from COVID-19 are advised to give vaccine to those who are exposed to their own immune system and those who have collected antibodies.
This strategy has produced unconvincing results for SARS experience.
Viral neutrality / control is an envisaged measure that can mediate the defense on SARS-CoV-2.
However, other methods, such as antiseptic cellular cytotoxins and / or physiocytosis, may be available.
The use of non-direct anti-foreign systems, such as monoclonal antibodies, is limited.
The production of a diseased spine, which is part of the blood’s flow and contains antibodies that are unique to this virus, may increase the speed of feeding.
Coronavirus disease, a related syndrome
Hekim Li Wenliang, who died of COVID-19 after developing an awareness of the spread of the virus at the central hospital.
