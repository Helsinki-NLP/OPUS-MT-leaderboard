Members of Parliament in Wales are afraid to look like girlfriends.
Some members of the Parliament were disturbed by the proposal to change their position from AMs to MWPs (member of the Welsh Parliament).
This fear has arisen following plans to change the name of the House of Laws to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of parliament in all the political rainbow are concerned that this will invite a joke.
One member of Parliament from the Labour Party said his men were afraid that "it's gonna be "with Twp and Pwp."
For the outside of Wales: in the Wallish, twp means stupid and-- pwp means pkki.
A member of the Parliament of the Feld Kemary Party said that all his friends were "not happy" and offered alternatives.
A member of the Welsh conservative Party said that his friends were "open to proposals" on the change of name, but he noted that the name MWP (the initials of the Walsey Parliamentary member) sounds very similar to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Walish signal w is expressed in a way similar to the expression of the letter and in English in the Yachtshire accent.
The House of Laws Committee, which currently refers to legislation for change of names, said: "The final decision on every word that describes the names of the roles of the members of the House of Laws is of course the decision of the members of the House of Laws themselves."
The Wells Government Act of 2017 gave the Walsey House the authority to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, in which broad support was given for changing the name of the House of legislators to the Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the function title of the members of the Parliament (AMs), the committee recommended that the members of the Welsh Parliament or the heads of WMPs, but the MWP option received most of the support in consulting with the public.
The members of the parliament offer alternative options, but the struggle to achieve Concenzus may cause quite a bit of a headache to the chairman of the committee, Ellen Jones, who is supposed to submit a draft of legislation on the changes in the coming weeks.
The legislation on other changes in the workings of the legislature, including rules for the removal of members of parliament and the structure of the committee system.
The vote of the members of the parliament is that you will eventually determine their title in the legislative debate.
Citizens of Macedonia are going to cards in a wish with a change of the name of the country.
Citizens will vote on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The people’s wish was to try to resolve a decades-old dispute with the neighboring Greece, where there is a province called Macedonia.
Greece has been claiming for a long time that its home in the north is a fence that claims to the territory of Greece and to the return and opposition of Macedonia to the attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, who objected to the wish of the people for a change of name, said he would ignore his findings.
However, those who support the wish of the people, including Prime Minister Zoran Zabe, claim that the change of name is just the price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's church are silenced. The difficulties of the churches are in the Harlem neighborhood.
According to Mr. Adams, "the residents of the old neighborhood were once a bar and a church in every corner."
"Today there are no bars and no churches."
He says it's possible to understand the disappearance of bars.
People's company life is going on differently today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living room where people visit on a regular basis."
As for churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of property won't survive for as long as the church leaders expect, "and sooner or later, they'll find themselves at the starting point again."
According to him, the churches will capture apartment buildings with common homes that house people who are not of the kind who help the neighborhood to maintain a unique character.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and that's why it's going to be more likely that the majority of people who move will join these churches."
The two churches were built by believing communities, before Harlem became the neighborhood of most of its black inhabitants - the Communist Metropolitan Church in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The white Methodist community left in the 1930s.
A black congregation operating in the area became the owner of the building.
The Church of St. Martin moved to a black - believing community under the minister John Howard Johnson, who led a ban on trading on 125th Street, a central shopping street in Harlem, which refused to hire or promote blacks.
Burning in 1939 caused serious damage to the structure, but as part of the plans of the believers under Reverend Johnson to rebuild it, they ordered the construction of the bells.
Priest David Johnson, son of Johnson the Father and heir to the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the Koran “the Bells of the Poor. ”
The expert who played in the interview in July called it "Cultural Treasures" and "Honour Tools Without Replacement".
The expert, Tiffany Inge of Michigan University, also mentioned this as the world's first bell career, which was played by a black musician, Dioncio A. Lind, who later played on the greater theory at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Mariwattr said that St. Martin's church didn't replace him.
What happened at St. Martin's church over the last few months was a complex story of architects and contractors, some of which were brought by the local church leaders, and others by the Episcopal Fathers.
The meeting — which is the governing body of the local faith community — wrote to the bishops in July, explaining her concern that the bishops would “try to roll the expenses ” into the meeting, although the meeting was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors who sent the evangelicals.
Some of the believers complained about the lack of Bible knowledge.
A 13-year-old wound shark in the sound of catching lobsters
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on a Saturday while the boy dived to capture lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, thus giving away official factors.
The attack took place a little before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Assinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV network in San Diego that he'd dived with friends about an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then he ran over there with a group to help bring him to the beach.
Hamel thought at first that it was just the enthusiastically shouting at Lobster's capture, but then he realized that the boy was screaming: “I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
Hamel said that when he got close to the boy, he saw that "every single one of his smuggling bones was pulled away."
"I yelled at everyone out of the water: "There's a shark in the water," added Hamel.
The boy was taken to the Radi Hospital in San Diego, where he was defined as an individual.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked the boy.
The rescue commander Larry Giles said in a press briefing that a shark was identified in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined not to be a dangerous food shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the coast between Ponto Cascad and Suami Bay in Asynitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles stated that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbory's planning to penetrate the market for beautiful products in Britain.
Sainsbory's starting a competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and opening dog store transitions with professional sales women.
As part of a significant initiative to penetrate the UK's beautiful products market, which circulates 2.8 billion trollings a year, and as it continues to grow as sales in fashion and products to the downside house, the vast passage of the beauty products will be checked in 11 stores across the country and if the experiment is successful, they will be added to additional stores next year.
The investment in beautiful products comes at a time when ricketists are going to pick up ways to use spectrum that has been captured by televisions, microwaves and homemade products.
From Sainsbory's said that the company was expected to double its production of its beauty to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time in its history.
Existing product lines of L'Oral, Maybelline and Burt's Bees companies will also win another area with designated brand areas like those in stores such as Boots.
The network also resets its manufacturing line - Botique - so that most products will be vegan-friendly, a feature that is called for by young buyers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop is going to check for privileges in two Sansbory's stores, the first of which was opened in Croyden, South London, last week and the second of which will be opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
shopping online and buying too little food in local comfort stores every day requires more gossip to get people to visit them.
Mike Kane, CEO of Sainsbory's, said that the branches would become more bloody for the dog's stores while the barbage network was trying to fight against the cheap Aldi and Lidl networks with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbory's added Argos' sales points in hundreds of stores as well as a number of habitat points since she bought both networks two years ago, additions to which increased the sales of the container products and made the purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts of the network to revive the beauty product exchanges and its pharmaceuticals have ended in failure.
Sainsbory's tried a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the communication ended after a dispute about how to split the profits from the pharmaceuticals into the prescriptions.
The new strategy comes after the Sainsbory's sold the business of the pharmaceuticals in 281 to Celesio, owner of the Loyds pharmaceutical network for 125 million stars three years ago.
According to Loyds will play a role in the program, by expanding the brands of expensive leather development products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
The business manager of Sainsbory's, Paul Mills-Hicks, said: "We've made a reverse in the appearance and sense of our beautiful products, to improve the environment for the customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained workers who will be available for advice instead.
Our delivery of brands is designed to match all the needs and the long-standing environment and our comfortable locations make us an attractive target for the purchase of beautiful products, in a way that challenges the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is angry after Holly Willaby canceled an 11 million-starling deal.
The TV star Dragons Den, Peter Jones, expressed “wrath” after the television show Holly Willabi canceled an 11 million-dollar deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Mark And Spencer and ITV.
Actually, Willaby doesn't have time for a brand of their house clothes and absorptives.
The two's joint business is similar to the Goop brand of the Guineth Paltro actress.
The 37-year-old This Morning program's presentation announced her departure at Post in Astgram.
Holly Willaby left the planet Dragons Den Peter Jones angry by recently canceling her participation in the expensive lifestyle brand of the two -- to focus on her oil contracts with Mark And Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones responded with anger when the television star announced during a storm meeting on Tuesday in his business offices in Marlo, Buckingham, that because of her new transactions - up to 1.5 Starling - she did not have enough time to dedicate herself to home clothing brands and their belongings.
The two's joint business was similar to the Goop brand of the actor Gwenth Paltrow and was expected to double Willaby's fortune, which was calculated at 11 million stars.
While 37-year-old Willabi published in Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones was on a British flight to one of his guest homes.
According to one source: "Truly was undoubtedly the top priority of Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would provide her with income in the coming decades.
A decision to leave completely surprised all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
The company stores in Marlo are full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that leaving Thes Morning's approach, which is one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost society millions of dollars as a result of massive investments in various products, from mining and candles to household clothes, and the potential for further delaying the launch.
And it could bring a long end to long companies.
Willabi, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
Willabi set up Truly with Cap in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined the Society's president in March.
Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV company.
Willabi will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Annette McPerlin as an I'm A Celibry program of ITV.
A close source to Jones said last night: "We don't respond to his business affairs."

He's been making fun of her criticism. He's won by the newspapers on statements that some of them define as "non-presidential" and that he's so positive about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said "news presenter."
"I didn't make any discharge."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after commending their first meeting in June as a major step in the direction of nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
But the negotiation for the release of a frozen nuclear weapon.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the highest diplomat from North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "welcome response" from the United States to the initial disarmament steps that North Korea has made.
Instead, according to him, the United States continues with sanctions designed to continue the stress.
Trump took a much more optimistic view of his speech in custody.
"We're in great shape with North Korea," he said.
"We almost went to war in front of North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim brought positive results - the cessation of missile tests, the release of prisoners and the return of the remains of American soldiers to their homes.
And he protected his extraordinary approach to the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full stadium, we had about 200 people standing there," Trump said when he pointed right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island and killed hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Lombob, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that there was no need for their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population lost their homes, it was not declared a national disaster, which was a condition for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it's a little challenging," said Mrs. Sombong.
Although Save the Children makes a team that travels to Pallo, it's not clear yet if foreign missionaries can go through the field.
Mr. Sotopo, the spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian authorities are involved in assessing the situation in Pallo to see if more international services are available to contribute to the relief effort.
In the light of earthquakes occurring relentlessly in Indonesia, the country remains unfortunately ill prepared for natural disasters.
While Tsunami shelters were built in Aceha County, they are rare in other coastal areas.
The obvious lack of alarms is likely a warning of tsunamis in Palo, although there is a warning that there has been a loss of life.
Even in the best times, travel between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics more complex.
A hospital ship that protected Lombobok to treat earthquake victims is making its way to Pallo, but it'll take her at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
The improvement of Indonesia’s poor infrastructure was at the center of President Joko Widodu’s election campaign, and he invested a lot of money in roads and railways.
However, Mr. Joko was faced with funding disputes about his reelection next year.
Mr. Jukou also found pressure on classes to continue in Indonesia as a result of the religious fervor of the majority of Muslims in the country.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes in battle between Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using knives, bows and arrows and other domestic weapons.

He jumped the ball to his left and then he kicked around the distance.
The ball flies up and down to the top right of the network.
The ball eventually landed over the gate of Capa Arisbaga that leaped into its passage, and fell into the network.
"I was just trying to get to this position, get to the ball and players like Shak always play ahead as far as possible, so I was just trying to create myself as much time as possible," said Sridge to the LeverpoolFC.com site.
"I saw Kanta and I made one touch and I didn't think too much about it and I just kicked."

From where the murders in Tsunami in Indonesia went up to 832.
From where the earthquake and tsunami killed in Indonesia reached 832, the State Disaster Agency was informed on Sunday morning.
A number of people reportedly trapped in the damage of the 7.5 buildings that had collapsed in the earthquake on Friday and caused waves up to 6 meters high, said the Agency's speaker Sotopo Foro was seen at a press conference.
The city of Palo, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered by the ruins of buildings that have collapsed.

The police opened a murder investigation after a woman's body was found in Bichand this morning, Mercedes.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. on John Street when she was stabbed, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police are calling people from the area who have seen or heard something to turn to.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is in the beginning, but I would like to offend anyone who was near John Street in Birkend and saw or heard something suspicious, approaching us.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken something in a car camera, to approach us -- because the photos may include information vital to our investigation."
A police officer confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkend and that she was found inside a building.
The scene came to the scene this afternoon with friends who thought they knew the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigations continue while the police have announced that they are now in the process of delivering messages to family relatives.

Cromwell's parliamentary statue has become the next target for attacks on memory situations in the struggle around the historical book.
The statue will be a poetic justice in the light of the televised faction that has been carried out by the Portuguese supporters of so many cultural and religious art objects in England.
But the Cromwell Society claims that Mr. Creek's offer is "stupid" and "exciting history".
John Goldsmeth, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "I must not have been in the present controversy over the removal of statues, the character of Oliver Cromwell, who is outside the Westminster Palace, will become a target.
The bombing of the statues of the civil wars in England was not carried out at Cromwell's command and was not carried out by him.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell fell victim to the actions of one of his predecessors, Thomas Cromwell, in the century before.
The impressive representation of Cromwell in the hands of Sir William Hammo Thornycroft is a testimony to an observation of the 19th century and some of the historical character of many who believe that it is still worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmeth said to the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was caught by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as the one who protected the parliament against outside pressure, in his case, of course the Queen.
The question if it's an entirely accurate assessment is the subject of an ongoing historical controversy.
A fact that she has no cause for concern is that the struggle in the middle of the 17th century designed our nation's development later, and Cromwell is one of the identified figures representing one side of the ground at the time.
His accomplishments as the Lord of Protection are also worthy of honor and victory."
A deadly pig that drove a Chinese farmer to death.
Local media sources report that a pig attacked a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
The man, known as his family Yewan, was found dead with a torn artery when he was covered in blood next to the pig den at the market in Lupánshouy in Guigão County, so the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A farmer is preparing to inject pig vaccines into a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Shining, Chiinghai County, China.
According to reports, he traveled on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Unionan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next day his cousin found him dead, and he found out that the door to a pig den was open.
He said Deir was found a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A criminal investigation confirmed that the 250-pound pig had attacked the farmer, according to the report.
"My uncle's legs were full of blood and blood," said his cousin named "Wu", as quoted in the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage show Yuan entering the market on Thursday morning at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Ivan or his cousin.
A marketing manager told Evining News that the pig was locked behind bars and running to prevent him from attacking other people, while the police are collecting evidence in the scene.
It was said that negotiations between Yuan's family were conducted with the market authorities about the compensation for his death.
Although the phenomenon is rare, there have been reports of cases where pigs have attacked humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused human injuries.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound-pound pig caught a farmer in Wales to his tractor until the farmer's wife escaped the animal.
After an organic farmer was caught by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Motifa told CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but the taste of blood could be "trigger".
"They're just playing.
They're like naughty kids, very researcher... They don't mean to hurt you.
We just have to give them the appropriate amount of respect." He said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rains in vast areas of the south-west of the United States.
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa's storm is weakening as it moves above the colder waters on the north coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
However, the storm Rosa will bring the bodies of flooding all over the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States over the next few days.
The winds in the Rosa storm came at a speed of 75 miles an hour, i.e., a hurricane storm in grade 1, and right on Sunday at 5:00 a.m. according to the East Coast clock, the storm center is located at a speed of 620 km south-east of Punta Eugena, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it is beginning to form an ape above the Pacific Ocean, which is heading east toward the east coast of the United States, with a small approach to the peninsula in California on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, starting to push deep tropical north into the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 milligrams of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, tropical wet that will fit in with the coming up with heavy rains in vast areas of the south-west of the United States over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 100 millimetres of rain will cause lightning and endanger landslides in the desert.

The long-term weather forecast shows high risk of higher temperatures than the average in the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people were watching Bert Cavaneau's hearing.
Over 20 million people were watching on Thursday, on six television networks, the fascinating testimony of the Supreme Court candidate, Bert Cavaneau, and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 80s of the previous century, Christine Blazy Ford.
In the meantime, the political debate continued, with news coming in the middle of the regular broadcasts to announce a surprising development on Friday: an agreement expanded by Senator Mariana Jeff Flick, according to which the FBI will conduct a weekly investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Legal Committee that she's 100% sure that Kawano's been makin' her body drunk and trying to raid her during a high school student party.
Quano, mixed testimony, said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
It's likely that the number of viewers was also higher than the 20.4 million watchers reported according to the Nilsen scale.
Nilsen checked the average observation on CBS networks, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nelson usually finds it hard to measure people watching the offices.
For comparison, it's a crowd watching a scale similar to that of the football or Oscar game.
According to Nielsen data, Fox News Channel, France's enthusiastic supporters of the designation of Kawano led out of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day's hearing.
ABC was second placed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC was 2.94 million, MSNBC was 2.89 million and CNN was 2.52 million, according to Nilsen's report.
The level of interest remains high after the hearing.
Senator Flick was the main character of the drama that took place on Friday.
After the office of the late Republican Senator issued a message that he would vote for the appointment of Cavano, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras when a group of protestors yelled at him as he was trying to get into the elevator to get to the hearing of the Legal Committee.
He looked down for a few minutes while the demonstrations were in the air, when all of this was filmed on CNN.
"I'm standing here before you," said one of the women.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are helpless."
Flick said that the survivors posted a message and said, before the elevator door closed, he would say more things at the committee hearing.
The transmission and cable networks all broadcast live a few hours later, when the Legal Committee was about to point out the candidates for the Senate vote.
But Flick said he'd vote in favour of the appointment only on condition that you get an understanding in the F.B.I.'s going to investigate the charges against the candidate over the next week, which the members of the democratic minority called for.
Flick is partly convinced by the conversations he has with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Cones.
After a conversation with Cons and several senators later, Flick made his decision.
Flick's decision had power, because it was clear that Republicans wouldn't have a majority to confirm the appointment of Quano without investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Quano.
Head of the British government, Teresa May, accused visitors who were playing in politics on the subject of blacksite.
Prime Minister Teresa May blamed the authors of her plans to leave the European Union that they were playing in politics with a future of Britain and being hit on the national Internet, in an interview she gave to the Sunday Times.

Mt. Pult ashes on Mexico City
Arguable ash released quickly from the Popocteptal volcano reached the southern neighbourhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the people of Mexico on Saturday to move away quickly from the volcano after the activity on the mountain surface had increased and 183 gas and ash refugees had been registered in 24 hours.
At the center of Nora's a number of noises and tremors.
Photos on social networks showed minute layers of ash cover on car ranges in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Socimilko.
Geophysicists have noted an increased activity on the volcano, which is 70 miles (45 km) southeast of the capital city, since an earthquake at 7.1 hit the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Guiu, has been active since 1994.
A collision between the police and minor alone in the vicinity of the anniversary to vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on a Saturday after independent demonstrators clashed with police forces to spread demonstrations, and thousands more joined demonstrations against the first anniversary of the party's vote on the independence of Catalonia.
A group of masked beads that were confused by the cops to spread demonstrations, lay eggs on the cops and spread paint powder to create black dust clouds on the streets, which are usually hit by tourists.
Controversy broke out later that day when police had to use the gods to get over the demonstrators.
For a few hours, independent support groups that sang “Unforgettable, Unforgettable” were set up in front of the united supporters who called the Spanish People.
In the local press, 14 people were reported to have been treated with minor injuries sustained by the demonstrators.
The tension remained high in the independent areas a year after the people's wish of October 1 was tried legally by the Spanish government, but we will be celebrated by the independent Catalans.
The voters chose to become an independent State in most large votes, although the grip of the vote was low when those who objected to the breakup were mostly blocking the vote.
The government authorities in Catalonia reported that almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the polling throughout the area from taking place in violent conflicts.
Independent groups set up a night camp on Friday to prevent the demonstration of support by the National Police.
The demonstration took place but had to take place in a different course.
Narcisse Terms, a 68-year-old electrician who was involved in a conflict of differences with his wife, said he had lost hope about Catalonia's chance of gaining independence.
Last year we experienced our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy about them voting, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the deadlyly different parties won an important victory, in the elections last December, they had difficulty keeping the momentum this year when many of their most well - known leaders were staying in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial on their part in the organization of the people’s wish and in the footsteps of the declaration of independence.
Juan Foyg, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police support demonstration on his phone, said that the confrontation was fought by politicians on both sides of the March.
"It's getting scary," he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Yonkers, one of the nine little leaders who have been in prison on trial since last year, announced that he would face the election to the European Parliament next year.
“To stand as a candidate for European elections is the best way to acknowledge the barbarity in democratic values and the repression we witnessed from the Spanish government”, he said.
A number of men were arrested after the car broke down at the house.
Three men -- at 33.34 and 39 -- were arrested after a car was killed several times in London.
The event took place on Thursday at around 19:30, according to the British clock.
Detective Bob Belmings said he had damaged the gates as well as the building itself.
It may also be that at some point a sharp arrow was fired into the car.
Manga's kick gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers.
Dolly Manga's first gate to Livingston promised victory
Livingston, who just went up to the league, amazed Rangers and Coach Stephen Jared that it's just his second loss in 18 games as the manager of the Ibrux Club.
Dolly Manga's kick meant a lot because Gary Holt's team moved to a level with the Hebrew instead of the other.
Gerar's group is left with no victory outside the house of the High League, and you will face the leader Harts, who is behind at eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna at the European League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston prolongs the loss sequence at home for six games, and the main coach Holt has not yet experienced a break since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities in front of a weak host group.
Holt's group was supposed to lead long before they slept at a gate, when their directness caused Rangers to have different problems.
Scott Robinson broke in ahead but dragged his experiments before a gate, and then Alan L. Guy could focus his efforts on the wider side only after he slipped in to meet Craig Helgate's infection before the gate.
Hosts were willing to allow Ranger to play ahead of them, knowing that they could be hard on the host group with free kicks.
And that was the way that the famous gate was processed.
Herring's got a free kick and Livingston created an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined in blocking Manga, who carried out a touch and led a gate from the center of the width.
At this point, Herring's been holding the ball, but they found out the house defense was intrusive, and the gateman Liam Kelly was almost unthroated.
This pattern was drawn to the second half, although Alfredo Morlos did have to save Kelly the gate.
Scott Pitnam was hit by the spies of the Rangers Alan MacGregor and Guy touched a large ball with another free kick of Levigston.
Cross-balls continued to enter the area of Livingston and bellow, while two punishment pills -- after the Luke's violation of the replacement Glen Middleton, and one on the hand touch -- were removed.
Mlwingston - surgery
Alstyre Lamont, BBC Scotland at Tony McCurney Stadium
Amazing game and amazing outcome from Livingston.
All the players were excellent, and they kept up with the expectations of this upward movement.
Their game style and the despair of the players have almost never changed since they returned to the leading position, but they have to be given a great deal of credit for the way he's dressed up the team since he arrived.
He had so many stars.
Captain Holkt was awesome, and led an organized defense, while Manga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Waral at high altitudes all along the way.
But Herring's was uninspired.
Although they were pretty good at times under Jarar, they did not meet those standards.
They were missing the final ball -- only once they opened the defense of the home team -- and it was red shot to Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the field.
Homecoming involved in Ardowan Beclan.
There were smiles and blue skies when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on Saturday (September 29,) for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdohan's controversial visit to Germany, whose aim was to repair the relationship between the two NATO member states.
They were the creators of opinions on such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s acceptance of the European Union.
From there Erdowan continued to participate in the opening of a new huge mosque.
Callen is the largest Turkish city outside Turkey.
The police announced the security reasons for the public obstruction of 25,000 people from the mosque front, but many supporters joined in to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors — many of whom are judges — have also heard their voice, protesting the policy lines of Erdowan and the German decision to welcome him to the country.
The opposing protestors reflect the controversy around the guest that some of the Turks in Germany praise as a hero and others protect him as a fan.

A biker was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision took place near the street at Stwood and Evelyn, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city, around 10:15 a.m., according to the British clock.
The driver stopped and the doctors took care of the wound, but the man died instead.
The collision came after another biker was killed in a hit-and-run on Childer Street, about a mile from the scene on Saturday.
The city police said the cops were trying to identify the killing and inform his family members.
Instead of placing barriers and buses on alternative routes, drivers are advised to avoid the area.

And last October, the protest officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious riot where guards were attacked by snoker sticks.
The hurricane, Rosa, threatens to flood down in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It's rare that a tropical sink hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's expected to happen at the beginning of next week, when the rest of the hurricane hurricane Rosa will cross the desert in the south-east and put them in danger of being swept away by lightning.
The National Weather Service has already declared a threat to the floods on Mondays and Tuesdays for the west of Arizona into south-east of Nevada, south-east of California and Italy, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Storm Rosa is expected to cross a direct track over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday with the rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix published a Twitter release that only 10 tropical cicadas have remained in a tropical storm status or a tropical sink within a distance of 322 km of Phoenix since 1950!
The Katrina storm (1967) was a hurricane in the 64-mile range of the Arizona border."
The last models of Arizona's hurricane hurricane center are watching 50 to 100 milligrams of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 millimeters in Arizona's mogulon.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Aborigines, are expected to receive 25 to 50 mm, with a possibility for isolated places to get 50 millimeters.
For those outside the area, there is a danger of flashing, the rain of a Rosa storm may be a blessing because the area has suffered in a form.
Although flooding is a serious danger, some of these rains will be helpful because the Southwest area is currently suffering from a form of condition.
According to U.S. form surveillance, over 40% of Arizona is in a tough form, which is the second category in materials, so reports a Web site.com.
First, a rosa storm route will reach the land across the peninsula in the fraternity of California in Mexico.
Rosa's storm, still in the power of hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 93 miles an hour, is located about 620 miles south of Punta Eugena, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of about 20 miles an hour.
The storm hit colder water in the Pacific, so you're getting weaker.
She is therefore expected to reach the land in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm in the afternoon or the evening of Monday.
Rains across parts of Mexico can be heavy and can cause severe flooding.
A total of 75 to 150 millimeters of rain is expected from Bhaba California to Northwest Sonora, with a chance of up to 250 millimetres, reports a Web site.com.
Then the Rosa storm will continue into Mexico with tropical money, before you reach the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical sink, which will then continue across Arizona into South Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from Rosa, or the rest of it, is heavy rains in Bhala California, southwest Sonora and south-west desert in the United States," the message of the National Center for hurricane.
These rains are expected to cause lightning and to cause life - threatening floods in the desert, and to cause landslides in the mountainous regions.

Trump said that Kawano suffered the guilt and anger of the Democratic Party
"Voice in favour of Judge Quano is a vote to reject the rudeness and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party", said Trump at a stop in Welling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kawano suffered the crimes, the anger of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Quano testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blazy Ford's accusation that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified in the hearing about her charge.
The president said on Saturday that the people of the United States saw the brilliant and the quality and the courage of the Quano that day.
"The vote to confirm the appointment of Judge Quano is a vote to confirm the appointment of one of the most distinguished legal minds of our time, a man of justice with an excellent history of public service", he told the audience his supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred to the appointment of Kavano as he spoke of the importance that Republicans would be able to vote in the middle of the priesthood.
Five more weeks to one of the most important votes in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but actually I am a candidate," he said.
That's why I'm running everywhere to fight for great candidates.
Trump claimed that the democracies are on the mission of "objection and interference".
A senior assistant to the Republican Party told CNN that the first central vote of the Senate on the appointment of Quano is expected to be no later than Friday.
Hundreds of people are killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number is rising.
At least 384 people were killed, many of them were carried off by massive waves crashing on the shores, when a severe earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slawisi, thus officially reported on Saturday.
Many people gathered for the festival on the coast of Palo on Friday, when waves at a height of six feet (18 feet) were crashing on the beach at sunset, and many were dragged to death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake at 7.5.
When the tsunami threat woke up yesterday, people still had their business on the beach and didn't immediately escape, and they fell victim, so said Sotopo Foro Noroho, the director of the BNPB disaster management agency, in the instruction in 'Akata'.
"The tanner did not come by himself, he dragged cars, logs, houses, he hit everything on the ground," Noroho said, adding that the tannery moved on the open sea at a speed of 500 miles (497 miles per hour) before hitting the beach line.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tanami and they survived, he said.
About 16,700 people turned to 24 centers in Pallo.
Air footage published by the Disaster Agency showed destruction to a large number of houses and shops, bridges, courses and a mosque surrounded by water.
A sudden shock continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series kills an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) in Indonesia stated in a message that energy released in the mighty earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb that was directed at Jericho during World War II.
According to him, the city's geography, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Noroho described the destruction as "extreme" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
Some of the victims' bodies were trapped under the ruins of damaged buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Norroho said that the number of deaths and damage could be larger along North Palo with a 300-mile-mile-long coastline, an area called Dungla, and closer to the land earthquake focal point.
The media, "Crushed completely and there's no information" in Dungla, said Noroho.
The Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its people and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy now, but it could get worse a lot more," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticized for not being informed that Tsanami had hurt Pallo, although official agents said that the waves had arrived at the time the warning was published.
In a video on social networks, a man can be seen on a high roof of a building shouting hysterical warnings about the tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes a wall of water crashing on the beach, carrying buildings and cars with it.
The Lord's News Agency couldn't immediately make sure that the photo was authentic.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused extensive power cuts that cut off the communications around Palo and made it difficult for the authorities to match the rescue efforts.
The army began sending transport planes with assistance from Jakarta and other caves, according to the authorities, but the survivors still desperately need food and other essential supplies.
The city's airport is only opened for aid efforts and is closed until October.
President Joko and Diouto were scheduled to visit the extraction centers in Pallo on Sunday.
From where the deaths in Indonesia were rising to more than 800.
It's very difficult.
While the people of the World Vision Dongue arrived safely in the city of Palo, where shelter workers made from a tarpaulin set up in the courtyards of their offices, they passed through scenes of destruction on their way, said Mr. Dusva.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very difficult.
Even while relief groups have begun the unfortunate actions of the disaster relief movement, we have complained that you have not been able to get to the Palo of experienced foreign relief workers.
According to Indonesia's regulations, funds, supplies and people from other countries can begin to be transferred only if the affected area is designated as a national disaster zone.
This thing hasn't been done yet.
"It's still defined as a district-level disaster," said Olya Ariani, speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says, "Okay, it's a national disaster," we can open the door to international assistance, but this status has not yet been announced."
With the second night on Palo after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, missing friends and family were held in hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that set the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy snoops from a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescue men rescued a woman buried under the debris for two days, with her body threatened by her side.
GANDON SOVANDONO, coach of Indonesia's extended parachute team, trained two missing wide parachutes for Asian games, which were completed earlier in Indonesia.
Others of those who were trapped in a visible hotel, including Mr. Mandge, were his disciples.
I'm carrying my own emotional burden, he said.
Mr. Ghandon remembered how in the hours after the news of the collapse of a hotel he saw spread among the large-scale congregation, he eagerly sent letters to the players in Pallo, who took part in the beach festival.
His messages, however, showed only one gray checker instead of a pair of blue marks.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Robbers took $26,750 during the filling of an ATM at the Newport on the Livee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 from a Brinks plant filled with ATM in Newport on the Leve, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver was empty of money at the entertainment center and prepared to get more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarte in a letter.
While he was busy, another man ran behind a breaker and stole a bag with money to fill in the ATM.
Until he saw a number of suspects running away from the scene, according to the message, but the police didn't tell how many people were involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identity is asked to contact the NYPD on 859-292-3680.
Reper changed his name to Ye.
Harper Kenya West changes his name to Ye.
Declaring the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The entity that was known as Kenya West."
And a 41-year-old set has been called "Ye" for a while and he's been using a nickname as his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change comes first on the Satredi Night TV show, where he's expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
He replaced the singer Ariana Granda who canceled her participation because of emotional reasons, so said the planmaker.
In addition, it's about the shortness of his current professional name, and West once said that word has religious meaning for him.
"I think that 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible the word means 'you'," West said earlier this year, when he talked about the name Albumo with the Big Boy radio.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It's gone from Kanye, which means the only one, just a little "Ye" -- just a reflection of the good in his son, the bad in his son, or the confused, everything.
The album is more reflective of who we are."
He's one of those famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Koombs has been known to replace Pafe Dadi, Pee Dadi or Didi, but this year he has declared his preference for the names love and brotherly love.
West’s ex - partner, J.Z., also went through versions of his name with and without a cover and a list.
The President of Mexico committed not to use the army against civilians.
The President-elect of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Oberdor, committed never to use military force against civilians, while the country is approaching 50th anniversary for bloody repression against students.
Lops Oberdor promised on Saturday at the Telalko square that he would never use the army to suppress the Mexican people.
Army forces fired on the non-violent demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when left student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
Lopez Oberdor committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by providing financial support to those studying and opening up public universities for free.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people into criminal gangs.
The United States has to double the funding of artificial intelligence.
As China's work in the field of artificial understanding is progressing, the United States needs to double the amount it invests in research in the field, thus saying the investigator in the field of artificial understanding Ky-po Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His words come after various parts of the U.S. government have published statements on artificial intelligence, even at the time the U.S. government does not have an official artificial intelligence strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented her plan last year: she's looking forward to being number one in an artificial building by 2030.
"Dualizing the research budget in the field of artificial understanding would be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the United States, and we're looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial understanding," he told me.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next major artificial understanding would be achieved in the United States, told me to the CNBC network at the interview this week.
"AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published in the month's edition of the Hoghton Mifflin Harcourt, by the Secretary-General for Innovation Ventures, who spent the most outstanding artificial intelligence company in China: Face++.
In the last 80th century at the University of Carnegie Hotel, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the first U.S. state-of-the-art Serbian player, later serving as senior manager at Microsoft Research and President of Google's China branch.
I've met with previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Agency's robotics challenge for advanced research projects, and asked when you'd be next in line to help identify the next vision people.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, told me.
"It's not China that takes the leading investigators at the Academy, it's the business companies that do it," he told me.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited stars from universities in recent years to work in the field of artificial understanding.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial understanding.
"I think Green Card should automatically be offered a doctor's degree in artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published its artificial understanding program for the next generation.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations in the U.S. Department of Rates, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, I say.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a joint centre and an artificial building, which was designed to involve industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a special committee and an artificial building.
And the month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an artificial understanding initiative under the name AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in research into artificial understanding.
Meanwhile, a U.S. legislation initiative designed to create a National Security and Building Committee has been inactive for months.
The inhabitants of Macedonia make a wish with a question whether to change the name of the country.
On Sunday, the inhabitants of Macedonia make a wish with a question whether to change her name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, a step that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that prevented her from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its neighbour from the north is in a line that claims to the territory of Greece and to the fact that it was assigned to NATO and the European Union.
The two states signed a deal in June based on the average new name, but opposers of the Muslims claim that the change would damage the ethnic identity of the majority of the Saudi population in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote on the wish of the people and on a campaign to ban them, questioning whether the number of voters would stand at a minimum of 50% required for the wish of the people to be valid.
The question in the ballot is as follows: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the European Union with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Those who support the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zabe, claim that it is a price worth paying for that Macedonia, which is one of the countries created by the break-up of Yugoslavia, can join bodies like the European Union and NATO.
"I came today to point out the future of the country for young people in Macedonia so that they could live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safe life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgesbecka in Scophia.
Although the people's wish is not legally binding, the members of the parliament said that they would obey the results of the vote to make it a concordant.
To change the name will require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Elections Committee said there were no irregularities right at 13:00.
However, only 16% of voters stood, compared to 34% in the last election to the Parliament in 2016, of which 66% were voting.
"I came to vote because of my kids, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Jose Tanbsky, voting in the capital city of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zabe, his wife, Zureka, and his son Dukko complete their ballot in Stromica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, in the wish of the people of Macedonia for a change in the name of the country, which will open the door to NATO and the European Union.
At the front of the Parliamentary House in Skopje, 54-year-old Demir Kaverdrov made a small stage and chairs in front of the tents that had been set up who had violated the wishes of the people.
"We're in favour of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join an antique head, not through the server's entrance," said Kaverdkov.
"We're a poor country, but we have respect.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zabee said that NATO companies would bring the most necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour of more than 80% of our citizens supporting the European Union and NATO," said Zabe after he voted.
He said that a positive outcome would be our future security.
A survey published on Monday by the Macedonia Policy Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the people's wish - less than the required participation.
Another wish, carried out by the TV network, found that 57 of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they'd vote yes.
In order for the people's wish to succeed, the percentage of voters must be at least 50% plus one.
A failure of the wish would be the first significant loss of the pro-west government policy since it took power in May last year.
Video: Manchester City player, Sageo Aguero, heading through the whole Bryton defense to score a gate
Savourio Aguru and Sterling's harbingers broke Bryton's defense at the 2-0 Manchester City victory on Saturday at the Mehshad Stadium in Mashster, England.
It seemed that Aguarro was easy to cover the gate.
An Argentine pioneer got a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Bryton's defense players, before entering the open field.
At this point Aguarro found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one shield before he got to run a few more shields on Briton's wide border.
And then he kicked a left handboat, and he found Sterling.
The English pioneer used his first wide touch to deliver the ball back to Guaru, which kicks at the right foot beats Bryton's portal, Matthew Ryan, with a ball on the right side of the network.
Aguarro has problems with his feet, said a director of the Manchester City Writing.
We agreed he'd play about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he's a portal lamb at the same time."
But it was Sterling that gave "the power of the sky" the advantage of starting with the superhero.
This gate came in the second minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Bryton's territory during this.
He sent a great cross-ball along the right wing to Leroy Sana.
Sana ran the ball before he led Sterling towards the far corner.
A blue player in the sky pushed the ball into the network right before he surfed out of the field.
Manster City will face fashions at the League of Nations on Tuesday at 12:55 a.m. at Rain-Kar Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play Spoiler in front of the Rockis.
With the Enciónles coming out of the Playoff competition, there was no good reason to force another start.
But a scraper that is very competitive, hoping to win on Sunday in front of Colorado Rockis, but only if it still has consequences for the playoff for the Rockies, leading one game on the Los Angeles Dougers at the NL West League.
The Rockies have at least sprayed themselves a place of open card with a 5-2 win on the Nessenals on Friday night, but they haven't promised themselves the first place at home.
"Although we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the viewers and the other team will play the highest level probably at any point I'm dealing with this year.
"Why don't I want to deal with it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the start of Sunday, but according to reports, they tend to let the Sherzer serve in such a situation.
Sherzer, it'll be his 34th start.
Washington's right-hand presentation is a record of 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 damages in 220 rounds 2/3 season.
Trump, there's a stop in West Virginia.
The President pointed out the situation around his elected candidate for the Supreme Court, Bert Quano, while he spoke of the importance that Republicans would be able to vote in the middle of the priesthood.
“ Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five more weeks for the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the most, most of it-- I don't run, but actually I do run, and that's why I run everywhere and struggle for great candidates," he said.
Trump kept saying, "You see this terrible group of extremists, you see it happening right now.
And if you're determined to take back the power by whatever means is required, you see the convictions, the loathings.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run to get power and control, that's what they want is power and control, we're not gonna give it to them."
Democrats are, he says, on the mission of "objection and intrusion".
And you've seen it over the last four days, he said, and he called the democracies angry, wicked, arrogant and dishonest.
He mentioned the leader of the minority on the Senate Legal Committee, the Democratic Senator Diane Pinstein, who had attracted the audience's level of contempt.
Remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, uh, what.
No, uh, I waited until -- it was really a bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a floristic place.
She can't stand those who express their opinion.
When the Momentum movement operators at my local party branch voted to dissipate me, it wasn't a big surprise.
After all, I'm the last in the line of Members of Parliament from the Libre to be told that they're not welcome, and only because we've expressed our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way because she was actively opposed to anti-antimism.
In my case, the decision to expel me was visiting me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe — for the most part — the subjects similar to those of which Mrs. Jeremy did not agree with previous party leaders.
On the Eastern Nottingham Liber Party meeting on Friday, it was said, "We want the meeting to be inclusive and pragmatic."
For most of my eight years as a local member of parliament from the Librarian Party, the General Committee meetings on Friday night were exactly like this.
At present, however, it is not the happiness of many of the meetings and the promise of “kinder, more gentle” politics that has been forgotten long ago, if it ever began.
It turns out more and more that the Lybour Party is not tolerant of different views, and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to lead the party.
This situation began shortly after Jeremy was elected to the head of the party, when colleagues who had previously thought we shared a similar political viewpoint began to expect him to make an appointment and take positions that I would never agree to — whether about national security or about one European market.
Every time I speak to the public -- and it doesn't really matter what I say -- it's coming right up to the abuse of social network evidence with rejection calls, the devolution of the politics of the center and the readings I don't have to be in the Libre Party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more lucky than my colleague, because the notes that I'm meant to make tend to be political.
I'm used to the professionalism and determination of the same colleagues who face a daily wave of racial abuse but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this age in politics is how levels of abuse have become a matter of routine.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Liberian Party must cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we've been in the same ploristic place, and with every "independence" decision or change of choice at all, the party becomes more difficult.
Over the past two years, I've had the pleasure of keeping my mouth shut, not being so loud and then I'll be fine.
But that's not what I got into politics for.
Since I joined the Libor Party 32 years ago as a school student, I have been noiseed by the neglect of the Tacher government which has almost broken down my public school class, looking for how to fight for better social services for those who need them the most — whether as a local councillor or a government official.
I've never hidden my political opinions, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could in any way confuse my political positions and issues with my current leadership.
For those who made the decision on Friday, all I have to say is that while the country is crawling towards Burksite to harm our families, businesses and public service, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Libre.
But to be honest, the one message I have is not to move Momentum in Nottingham, but to my chosen public, whether they're members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of rejection threats or political benefits will stop me from acting in a way that I believe serves most of all of your interests.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbleached Air to the top
Two last freshs slightly reduced the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Air deserves to win the wonderful and wonderful game that was held today at the Scotch High League.
They're now at the top of the table, the only unconquerable side of the teenager.
In the end, it was their best defense, as well as taking a lot more risks, playing for the house team, and coach Peter Morchie had all the reasons to be happy.
"We've been testing our games so far, and we're still unconquerable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christy of the Melrose Group said, "Lair deserves all the credit, they've taken better risks than we do."
Grant Anderson's Trey on the 14th minute, which was played by Fraser Clemo, put Air in the lead position, but a yellow card for the Scottland Rory Hughes team that was released to the game by Horiors enabled Maruz to get points and Jason Bagot caught Trey not Homer.
Clemo brought up Air's lead with a felony, before it's half past half, is a lamb and then Mer Trey Solo to get 17-5 at half an air.
But Melrose opened the second half well and the Trey of Patrick Anguerson, which was said by Gott, narrowed the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay because of a serious injury to Rodrech Knut, which was taken away from the loonka, and began with the game's renewal, Air raised the gap through the Tray of Stafford McDowell, which was said by Clemo.
Filling Air Blair MacParson's place, then a yellow card, and again, Melrose used the other person with Trey who didn't Homer's Bruce Colleen, at the end of a series of tremendous pressure.
But the house team recovered, and when Strong Titchinson got a yellow card on a bulletless clemo attack, the penalty line, MacPrison Tach Down behind Air's advanced bulk.
Clemo Hammer, as he did almost again from his return to the game, after Kyle Roy Ass kicked David Armstrong's box and sent the Greg Henry to the sixth Trey of the house.
Star Still Game seems ready for a new career in restaurants.
Star Still Game, Ford Kirnan, seems ready to move to the restaurant branch after he found out he was designated manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in BBC's popular program, which he writes and answers, along with his old roommate, Greg Hepley.
The couple announced that the next 9th season would be the final season of the program, and it appears that Kirnan is planning a life after Creling.
According to official records, he's the director of Adriftmoren Limited.
The actor refused to respond to the story, although the source of the Scotch San implied that Kirnan was looking for ways to get into the prosperous restaurant business in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia that can't find the sea.
Sailors at the Navy command are wrapped up in a few ships in Bella-Paz.
Public buildings take off a blue-sea flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon carry the password: "The sea is ours by right.
It's our duty to sue him back."
Throughout Bolivia, where there is no sea, the memory of a shoreline lost in favour of Chile in bloody conflicts over resources in the 19th century is still alive -- as is the chemistry to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes may have been held for decades, while Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court on October 1 after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and he's obviously expecting a positive attitude to be shown," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will make a decision by the International Court on the basis of large consensus across the country, in the hope that the Hague Court will decide in the interest of Bolivia’s demand that after decades of interrupted calls, Chile will be required to negotiate a sovereign approach to Bolivia.
Bolivia's native state-of-the-art, Ou Morales, who faced a controversial struggle for re-election next year, had a lot of decision to make on Monday.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised at the end of August.
But translators think there's not much chance that the court will be in the favor of Bolivia -- and that even if it decides for its own good, it won't matter much.
The United Nations court sitting in Hagg has no authority to grant Chilean territory, stating that it will not determine the results of possible calls.
The fact that the International Court's statement came only six weeks after the agreed arguments were heard indicates that the case was "not complex", but Paz Zarata, a Chilean international court expert.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's claims, they may have been weakened by even the last four years.
"The sea access issue was kidnapped by the current government of Bolivia," said Zarata.
The war history of Morales has destroyed all the rest of Chile’s goodwill.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will keep talking, but it will be very difficult to have discussions after that.
Both states haven't changed between ambassadors since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodriguez Valz, a representative of Bolivia Hagg, rejected the idea that court disclosure was abnormally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a great opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and to put an end to 139 years of disputes for the benefit of both sides, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, is using the issue of the sea as a political leverage.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific", he added.
"Stop is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear damage will not happen unless it can trust the United States.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong, said I'd like you never to unload the nuclear weapon first if she can't trust Washington.
Ree spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two rival countries.
It appears that the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompau, is on the threshold of a reopening of diplomatic contacts on nuclear weapons that have reached a dead end more than three months after the Singapore summit with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Rey said it was a dream in Asfamia to think that the further sanctions and resistance of the United States to declare the end of the Korean war would force North Korea to kneel.
The United States is afraid to agree to a declaration without North Korea first taking significant steps towards the release of nuclear weapons.
They're Kim and they're the president of the United States, Donald Trump, interested in the second summit.
However, there is considerable doubt that North Korea is serious about the violation of its nuclear weapon position, where it is likely to see the only way to protect its safety.
Pompey's planning to visit Pyongyang next month to make a second summit between Kim and Trump.
A fashion show in Paris reveals the new tarnd in giant hats on its way to expensive stores everywhere.
The solution will be found for anyone who wants to expand the hat collection or get full protection from the sun.
The designers, Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a line of huge, crazy head coverings for their SS19 collusion, in a fashion show that slammed the fashion scene in Paris.
Unfractory hats have been wearing the summer instagram, and these designers have brought their extraordinary works to the fashion show track.
Valentino's most prominent item was an excessive-colored hat on large-scale winged winged fly-like hat covering the heads of the models.
Other handcuffs of a large size included clumsy promises, a magic hat and even anaesthetics -- but they weren't meant to protect the head from the cold.
Tom Brown also revealed a weird mask selection-- check in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks included stitching lips and blood for Hannibal Lecter than for Hot Kutor.
One piece mentioned a sail mask including Norkel and glasses, and another looked like a melted ice cream cup.
And those who want to continue with a huge-scale fashion saying -- their time has come.
Fabricists watch the giant hills make their way to the fancy stores everywhere.
The giant hats are the next hit after the Bomba's, the straw hat with a half-foot-knives in front of everyone's head, from Mariana to Emily Ritayowski.
Lybel Calt behind the very non-partite hat that predicted the social networks that gave birth to another large piece of craft on the course -- a key purse almost as big as the one of the seaweed model that carried it.
A burnt-colored medical bag, with a thick, white skin, was the most prominent item in the SS19 collection of Jaline La Rivira in Paris.
A Stileist known as Luke Armitag said to FEMAIL: "I'm watching big hats and big seabags come to the stores next summer -- because the design made a huge impression and it would be hard to ignore the demand for super-size Exosores."
John Edward: Language skills essential to the world’s citizens
The Independent Schools of Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this lasts in 2018 with a further collection of outstanding test results, which is supported by personal and group success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, which are represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), allow for the best level of service for students and parents.
Independent schools are eager to prepare their students for another and higher education, for their chosen career as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector capable of planning and developing a program of personal adaptation, we discover modern languages that continue to be popularized as a desirable field of study at school.
Nelson Mandela said: "When you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes into his head.
Speaking to a man in his own language, it went into his heart."
It's an important reminder that we can't rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the last test this year, languages are at the top of tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who have learned foreign languages have achieved a high A score.
The data collected from the 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students achieved higher grades A in Mandarinian, as well as 72% of those in German, 69% of those in French and 63% of those in Spanish.
These data show that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Today, language as a subject of choice is viewed at the same level as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the school programs of the independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the British Council for Employment and Skills found that, among the reasons that employers mentioned coded to fill available posts, 17% of the population would be deprived of language skills.
Thus, to a greater or lesser extent, language skills are essential to preparing students for future careers.
At present, language demands for future employment opportunities are essential in the world of globalization.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he learns a second language, he will have a significant advantage in the future because of this lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries is automatically stable, a person who is in advantage of competitors.
According to a 2013 YoGov survey involving more than 4,000 adults in Britain, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language at a level that was sufficient for a conversation, and French was the only language in which there was a double-count number of speakers, 15 percent.
That is why it is important to invest in language instruction for children today.
Knowledge in many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, every school will be different about the languages we learn.
Some of the schools will focus more on the classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most thoughtable for Britain in a forward-looking way to change the 20th century, such as Mandrian and Japanese.
No matter what the child's interest is, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in the independent schools with a teacher team that specializes in the field.
The Independent Schools of Scotland are obliged to provide a school environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, in any future.
Today, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the nation, so this fact needs to be expressed in education.
Indeed, it should be seen in modern languages as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland’s children.
It's the time order.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools
LeBron is expected to play for the first time in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait was over for fans who waited to see LeBron James playing for the first time on the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James would play the pre-season game in front of the Denver was hit on Sunday in San Diego.
But a few minutes ago, he'll be playing.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48", written on the official Lakers website.
Lakers Mike Trudle wrote on Twitter that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games of Lakers.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Tramp's stop time in West Virginia, Utiv channel
President Donald Trump opens an election wash tonight in Welling, Virginia.
This is the first of five planned arrests of Trump this week, including those in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While voting for his appointment to the Supreme Court judge, Trump wants to build support for the election of the approaching middle priest, because the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
What time is Trump's arrest in West Virginia tonight and how can she be watched online?
Trump's arrest in Welling, West Virginia, is scheduled to start at 19:00, according to the East Coast clock, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can be seen in a tramp stop in West Virginia on the Internet in a direct flow through Utiv.
Trump is likely to refer to the hearings that took place this week for High Court candidate Bert Quano, and they have become stylish around the charges of inappropriate sexual conduct and following the rejection of the vote in Saint-Sent week while the FBI is investigating the charges.
But the main objective of this arrest wash is to help Republicans face the challenges of November to gain some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's election headquarters said that the objective of these five arrests next week is “to motivate volunteers and support the time that Republicans try to protect and expand most of their possession of St. and the House of Representatives”, according to Ritters.
Congressional control is so critical to his agenda, until the President is willing to visit as many countries as possible with the introduction to the crowded election season, he told Reiter that he was speaking on Trump's election trip that he had asked to remain anonymous there.
The arrest tonight, scheduled to take place at the Wesbankko Stadium in Welling, could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract a press coverage from the Pittsburgh press, to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the country where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for St. Virginia from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who's retarded in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to improve his situation in the polls," said Simon Heider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reiter.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows right to struggle to keep the hope for the only games on Sunday.
After three one-sided scans, the four games on Sunday afternoon are probably exactly what Ryder Cup needs.
Momentum's driving loot is a fully created concept of sports, but the players really believe in it, and never more than in competitions like this.
So where do they think we're gonna find the munatom now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so you can see a little mumentum," said Gern Speth at the end of a day.
Europe has, of course, four forward points with 12 more in the game.
But the Americans, as Speth says, feel a little bit of wind in the sails, and they have a lot to encourage, and not the last in the form of a sofa and Justin Thomas playing together all day long, and each of them broadcast three points out of four.
Speth was a killer from Hetty to Green and is a personal leader.
The noises of joy increased as his round continued, when he drowned a critical Pat to win the game four-square and Thomas went down two after two.
His Pat who won the 15on game won a similar shout, the kind that shows that he believes the American team still has hope.
"Really, you just have to dig deep and worry only about your own game," said Speth.
That's all that's left for each of those players to do.
18 rocks to leave a seal.
The only players with more than a few points 'and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinary and Tommy Fletwood, the unincited leading story of the Ryder Cup.
The weird pair, but the charming ones of Europe are four out of four and all are praised.
"Molliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit over the device on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the buggies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and nine on Friday morning.
The same round, and the way that their energy appears to flow to and from the enthusiastic crowd, is based on the fact that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Flletwood or Molinari to sign the potential European victory with the sun going to be placed on the golf field Le Golf National.
They'd better both at the same time in different waves.
However, it's too early to talk about European fame.
The doll and Tasson Web Simpson ended up with Sergeio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he shot Alex Noren.
Bogey and two times the nine fronts dropped the Spanish and the bandits into a hole that they didn't get close to getting out of.
However, there's no one on Sunday to help you get out of the hole.
It's interesting to look closely at the four bullets and fours because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change into an eye.
Europe has played better as a group so far and significantly led towards the last day, but this fourth tooth has shown that the American team is filled with a spirit of fighting that some, mostly within the United States, have questioned.
Europe leads 10-6 towards the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is in a healthy strain towards the last day of the Ryder Cup after completing the four-ball and four-year-old games on Saturday at 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired couple Tommy Flettewood Warnsko Molinari led the change with two victories over the struggling tiger Woods, and has thus far brought the gap to four points in Le Golf National.
The European side players of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to protect the cup lost in Heislettin two years ago, ruled in front of the Americans who missed the four-ball games this morning, bringing the series to 3.
The American players showed a lot more resistance in the four games, and they won two games, but they couldn't close the gap.
To keep holding the Cup, Jim Forrick's friends need eight points out of the only 12 games.
Fletwood is the first European rocket to win four points in a row, while he and Molinary, who won the name "Molwood" after an extraordinary weekend, are just the second pair to win four points of their opening games in Ryder Cup's history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball games, they continued in a remarkable harmony together to defeat the complete Woods and the American rookie Bryson D'Chembao with a more remarkable result of 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed random outbreaks of excellence, but so far he's lost 19 out of 29 games of four and four, and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting during the morning four-ball games, came back to join Henrik Stanson in the quadruplets to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coca, who ranks first and third in the world.
Yet, not everything went easily to European players in the pleasant weather and the mild spirit of the south-west of Paris.
The most prominent winner three times is Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas, who set the threshold for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a two-and-a-one victory over John Ram from Spain and Ian Polter in the four-ball games and later returned to defeat Fletter and Rory from Clroy 4 and 3 in the four-games, after losing the first two bodies.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup group back from a negative four-point gap to the only games, although as the players in the Cup, Forrick's people just need a bag to keep holding the Cup.
However, after two days of standing in second place, it seems that the attack against them on Sunday is beyond their ability.
North Korea says, "No way," she won't break apart from one-sided kiss without trust.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea announced on Saturday that further sanctions would deepen her trust in the United States and that there is no way the State would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under these circumstances.
Rey Young Ho announced at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "considerably good will" in the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear missile tests, the launch of the nuclear test site and the commitment not to develop any further nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see any consistent response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we can't be sure about our national protection and under such conditions in no way and we won't unload ourselves unilaterally from a nuclear weapon."
While Sherry repeated the known complaints of North Korea about the US's resistance to nuclear detonation, that North Korea will be rewarded while taking step-by-step steps, his statement seems important because it has not refused nuclear explosion, as North Korea has done before.
Ri referred to the joint announcement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first peak in history between a United States president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim committed himself to the "nuclear break-up of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to protect the security of North Korea.
North Korea requested an official end to the Korean War, which took place in 1950-1953, but the United States said that North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States has also opposed readings to reduce international sanctions on North Korea.
The U.S. insists on "a first nuclear release" and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goal in a path of willfulness, and even objects to "announcing the end of war", says Ri.
“ The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is a dream in the asthma of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is the dirty sanctions deepen our lack of trust."
Ri never mentioned the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the President of the United States highlighted in his speech earlier in the week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader, Mon Jia-Non, in the last five months, adding: “If the other side of the nuclear issue was South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
However, Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's, so he told the General Assembly of the United Nations that the U.S. Earth attack on North Korea's missiles is inevitable after Mr. President of Evil Trump called Kim Rocket Man on the suicide mission.
Last year at the UN, Trump, who threatened North Korea's total destruction last year, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said that there was still a lot more work to do and that the sanctions must remain in the cloud until the North Korean nuclear fire.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a defined time frame for it, and he added, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claimed that the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for steps taken.
However, the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompau, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with determination and without interruption until we achieve a complete and universal final nuclear denuclearization."
The Security Council has supported one of the sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block the financing of its ballistic and nuclear missile plans.
Pompey met with Ree at the United Nations General Assembly and later said he'd be visiting Pyongyang again next month to prepare the next summit.
Pompey already visited North Korea three times a year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left E pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for putting "Gangster demands".
North Korea promised a meeting with the Moon of the month to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear facility, if the United States were to take "corresponding steps".
He said Kim told him that the "corresponding steps" in which he was interested included security assurances for which Trump committed himself in Singapore, as well as changes in the direction of normalization of the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to rest enough.
A new Harvard university course this year teaches participants how to sleep more, trying to fight the culture of Match and the expansion of learning by staying awake all night with caffeine.
An academic study found that students at university No. 1 in the world often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kessler, professor of sleep sciences at Harvard Medical School and an expert at the Brigham And Women's Hospital, planned the course, whose assessment is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to open the course after a lecture about the effect of sleep deprivation on education.
"At the end of the talk, one girl approached me and said: 'Why are they just telling me this now, in my last year of school?'
She said no one's ever told her about the importance of sleeping -- which surprised me," he said to the telly newspaper.
The course, which is passed for the first time this year, explains to students the principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall condition.
Paul Breira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and senior director of health services at the University, said that the university had decided to open the course after finding out that students had suffered from severe insomnia during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive missions.
In one part, there is a picture of a dorm room, where students press coffee baskets, curtains, sports clothes and books -- to get explanations of the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of sleeping habits.
In another part, it tells participants how persistent sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a map of campus, if interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of the students between night and night.
But we think they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know the effects of choosing cigarettes," added Professor Cizzler.
A culture of pride about sleepless night success still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students make sleep deprivation increasingly difficult.
Concern for sufficient sleep, and good sleep, must be the secret weapon of every student to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid weight lifting, because sleep deprivation leads the brain to hunger, so we're hungry all the time.
Raymond Soo, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Zizler design the course after attending one of his first years in Harvard.
He said that the course made his eyes shine and moved him to encourage an entire campus course.
The next step, as he hopes, will be to ask all students for advanced descriptions to complete a similar instruction program before joining the competition institution.
Professor Ciselle recommends that students check the possibility of targeting a clock when it is time to go to sleep, not just when it is time to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of a blue light that emits electronic consents and LED light, which can break the ceramic rhythm and thus cause problems in the coma.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rings: gate of a terrible manga to Jared's players
The Rangers took another attack of losing the game except when Dolly Manga caused Stephen Jared's rebel players to defeat 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrux players have been hoping to win their first win in the game except since February 1-4 in St. John’ston, but Gary Holt’s team has lost only Gerard B18 and has left the team at eight points after the awarding Harts team at the top of the Scottish Supreme League.
Manga attacked seven minutes before the middle and it didn't seem like herring's players were gonna be equal.
While Herring's now landing in sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and immediately after the Hebrew at the gate.
And maybe wait for another Rangers Debel after the Kwan Kalum Spence needs to be treated for a head injury after the item was probably thrown off the offer.
Jared had eight shifts in a group that passed by Air into the middle of the final in the Taffard Cup.
Holt, however, went up with the same 11 Livingston players who made a point of Hartz last week, and he could have had a wish from the way his players beat the opponents anyway.
Herring'rs may have controlled the ball holding, but Livingston did more with the ball he had in their hands.
They almost killed the second minute when Manga sent a bullet to Scott Patman that kicked to Alan McGregor's gate, but the middle-field player kicked the ball too far.
Then a deep, free kick of Kegan Jacob found Captain Craig Alekt, but his shield Alan Leigh could only kick out of the Koran.
Herring did take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their last third game.
Alfredo Morlos certainly thought that he had to decide for himself what he had committed after a quarter of a game, when he and Steven Wills ran into a collision, but Judge Stephen T.
Herring's only managed to kick twice to the gate in the first half, but the Abrax Leam Kelly Bellem easily got Sana Colivali's infection and Obi Jeremiah's weak kick.
While the opening of Livingston on the 34th minute was contrary to the way the game was conducted, no one would deny that they deserved it at least for their hard work.
Herring's failed again in dealing with Jacob's deep free ball.
Scott Artfield did not respond at the time that Declan Gallagher transferred the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept a cool mood in his transfer to Manga for a simple ending.
Jared did a half-time job when he replaced Collebely with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a direct effect when the extreme/blowing bullet to Morlos but Kelly the Marx ran from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to force the host group to play exactly the kind of game he liked, as Guy and Luket continued to send long bullets.
Holt’s group could have increased the lead at other stages, but McGregor was well equipped to prevent Jacob’s experience before it got worse.
Herring's alternate player Glenn Middleton was further charged with moving in front of Jacobs, but Thompson was ignored again.
You're making up Mona Gaeger.
And now stand out of Godship of "Sundday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and continue... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilham was born in Germany.
Gier developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, a invention that eventually led to a device known as Mona Giger.
Since then, the device has become a medium in science, but in 1950 it also became a medium in pop culture because of the film "Bells of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans became two strange mornings/scientists:
Man: "What the hell is this thing?"
Rogers: "This is Mona Giger, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put your ears together, you can really hear the effects of the radioactivity on the atoms in the minerals."
Evans: "Oh, my God, it's really bombing now!"
The Hans Giger went to his world in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live after him.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and eliminate them.
Immunization teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells as part of treatment
The method includes the extraction of vaccine cells from the patient, and the replacement of cells in the lab.
Then the cells can "see" protein common to many types of cancer and then they're curious back to the patient.
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who has been treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells, has been gone for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, the replacement of cells in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2 that is common to many types of cancer, and then the injection of cells back into the patient.
Professor J. Brazovsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Battsda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "Reindulging the development of a number of cancers", including cancer of the demon, disease, vision, and gastrointestinal tract, explained Professor Barzophy.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has been able to treat a type of blood cancer.
Kenya West entered a speech in support of the Trump, when he was head of a MAGA hat, after showing up at SNL.
It wasn't taken in a pretty eye.
Kenya West responded to the poaching at the studio during a confused performance at the St. Nate's program, praising the President of the United States Donald Trump and saying that he would run for the presidency in 2020.
After performing his third song on the show, called "Gossip Town", during which he wore a Mace America Great hat, he broke a statement against the democracies and repeated his support in a tramp.
"So many times I talk to white people who say, "How can you love Trump, is he racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL's episode began with an evaluation of Matt Damon's failure, where the Hollywood star mocked Bert Quano's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee, regarding charges of sexual assault brought by Christine Blazy Ford.
Although the argument was not broadcast on the show, the thing was uploaded to social networks by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to roll West in advertising this thing.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had put behind the scenes on the hat he was wearing.
"They attacked me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go to the stage with that hat on your head."
They attacked me!
And then they said I'm in a dark place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West kept saying, "You want to see the dark place?" saying he was wearing my Superman hat, 'cause that means no one can tell me what to do.
Try to show love."
His words were read contempt at least twice by the audience, and it seemed that SNL team members were embarrassed, a Variety report, and one of them told the newspaper: "Shut of silence fell in the entire studio."
West is being added to the program as a last-minute turn in place of the song singer Ariana Granda, whose ex-wife, Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West many hundreds when he performed the song I love it when he was dressed as a Perier bottle.
West has been supported by the head of the TPUSA conservative team, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest souls: thanks for not giving in to the crowd."
But the Accolalia Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter West, "Be who he is and it's totally wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward (by buying music or betraying it or supporting its "art") that I think is an effort and dissemination of ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, the Raper announced Twitter that he had changed his name, and said that now he's the "who used to be known as West Canyon".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Didi, Papi and P Didi.
Another rapper, Snoop Doc, held the name Snoof Lyon, and, of course, the famous musician Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist who was known in the past as Krylins.
A charge of attempted murder following a stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Biafra.
The suspect is expected to appear in the courthouse of Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
The star of the series of throne games, Keith Harrington, attacks the toxic maleity.
Kite Rinton is known for his role as John Snow, the sword-flow of the series of violent marine fantasy games of the throne.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the Matchu hero's stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen often convey to young children the message that they must be tough to respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought that something went wrong and wondered how to deal with the problem of poisonous masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Keith, who recently married another star in the throne games, Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, admitted that he was very upset about treating this kind of thing.
"Man, I feel very upset right now -- where did we make a mistake about masculinity?" He said.
"What do we teach men in their growing period, from the point of view of the problem we're witnessing to now?"
Keith thinks that the TV may be partly responsible for raising toxic men because of the very human characters she's presenting.
He continued: “What comes from within? What will we learn from outside?
What do we learn from the TV, and on the street, that makes young kids feel they have to be on this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the greatest questions of our time -- how does it change?
'Cause there's no doubt something went wrong for young men."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not participate in any series of follow-up or a series of inherited throne games after the conclusion of the series next summer, saying that he was finished with battle fields and horses.
From November Keith will be reprinted to the play of a real Sam Shepherd West, who will tell the story of a movie producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently found out he saw that he had met his wife Rose as the best thing that ever happened as a result of the throne games.
"I knew my wife in the series, so that's how this series gave me my future family, and my life from that moment on," he said.
Rose played the role of Jagwright, the theme of John Snow's love, in the fantasy series won the Amy Prize.
The two of us married in June 2018 in the Lesley family yard in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% rise in new cases
China has declared a 14% drain on a number of civilians living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are sick, so they have been given official health care.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been infected as a result of having sex, which is a change to the past.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, according to official health factors in China at a conference in Union County.
However, depending on the year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000.
The HIV transmission as a result of sexual intercourse is a burning problem in the Chinese U.S.
Homosexuality ceased to be against the law in China in 1997, but it was said that the abortion against LATmen was extensive.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of infection are the result of insufficient protection in relation to these sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has guaranteed universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her team leaked information about a republican senator and protects the "dangerous lies" and "conspiration theories"
The American Senator Maxine Waters rejected the charges on Saturday that a member of her team had published personal information about three American senators on the senator's Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic Senator of L.A. estimated that the charges were broken down by websites and visited by "extreme right".
"Falses, lies, and other detestable lies," said Waters in the Twitter announcement.
According to the reports, the information that was published included the residence addresses and telephone numbers of the American Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both of them from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, and was published by an unknown person at the Capitol Hill during the hearing before the Senate Committee on sexual misconduct charges not filed against the Supreme Court judge, Bert Quano.
The leak took place a while after the three senators asked Kavano.
Reserved websites, such as Gateway Pundit and Redstate, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was linked to Waters' office and published information on a member of Waters' team, according to the Hill report.
"This baseless charge is totally wrong and a complete lie", added Waters.
"My teammate - his identity and personal details were exposed and his safety was affected by these false accusations and errors - in no way was responsible for leaking this information.
This base-less guilt is totally wrong and a total lie."
Watters' announcement was rapid online criticism, including from the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleicher.
That's an angry denial, wrote Fleischer.
“ It shows that she does not have the weather required of members of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he can't react in anger.
He's not allowed to react in a crash.
He can't question the motives of the defendants.
He has to be calm and calm."
It seemed that Fleisher was comparing Waters' response to the interrogation of the dictatorships against Judge Quano, who accused visitors who seemed too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to defeat Waters in the middle of the priesthood, also raised his thoughts on Twitter.
Big if it's true, he wrote on Twitter.
In her announcement, Waters said that the survivor had turned to the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these false claims.
"We'll make sure the criminals are found out" is the attraction that they'll be judged for all their destructive and dangerous actions against my crew members.
Johny English 3.0 '-- a weak spy parody in the back of Roan Atkinson'
Today, it is acceptable to look for meanings about Burksite in every new movie with a British perspective, and it does seem to fit this resurrection of the Johny English series of action projects that started there in 2003 with Johnny English and woke up back to life in 2011 with Johnny English coming back.
Is an ironic self-stealing about how worthless we are will become the new export opportunity of our country?
In any case, Johnny Ingelish the Solomonite with the open eye and the rubbery face has had another chance to break things down — and his name represents more than a wide-ranging comedy made for filmmakers in non-English-speaking countries.
He's, of course, the stupid English agent, who, although his weird face-to-dark-warming position seems a bit like a clauzo, a little bit of a master between and more of this guy who contributes a single to the pleasure of the fire trucks in the opening text of the Olympics in London in 2012.
It is also based primarily on the mysterious international traveler who played Atkinson in television ads that are forgotten to Barkycard, leaving chaos behind.
There's one or two nice minutes in Johnny English's latest edition.
I liked the part where Johnny English approached the helicopter when he was wearing a middle - class armor, and the propeller would ring for a second on his helmet.
Atkinson demonstrates his existing physical abilities, but Homer feels pretty weak and strangely unnecessary, especially because the "recent" type of spy movies like 007 and an impossible mission themselves now includes a comedy component.
The humor feels like it's turning children instead of adults, and because of Johnny English's mad adventures, it's less brilliant and focused on the jokes of Atkinson's popular movie like Mr. Ben's.
The film story starts when a great danger threatens Britain.
A computer hacker into the British spying super-secret Internet, exposing the identity of all British agents in the field, alarmed by the chief agent -- unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a proud, battle-like head of government who already suffers the complete collapse of a popular political loss: Emma Thompson does her best to play the role of Teresa May, but she has nothing to do with the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy has been exposed, she'll have to bring someone back from paying.
And that means Johnny English Herbani himself, now employed as a school manager at a prestigious institution, but gives unofficial classes on how to be a hidden spy: some good jokes here, when English offers a school rock college.
English is brought back to Whitewall for emergency briefing and brings together his former assistant to the Buff sufferer, who is again playing Ben Miller.
Buff is now a man married to a submarine chief, in the role of an annoying class queen on which Vico Padredine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's secret service income to a terrible complex are returning to operation, with a beautiful Pham-pattal in the form of a Boltuba Opalia playing the same olga Corilenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is in a dangerous position under the magic of a billionaire of charismatic technology who claims to be able to solve the problems of Britain’s evil computer, Jason Vulta, at the age of Jake Lacey.
In England and Buff, they start in their Academy that is more than a pair of clowns: under the cover of waiters, they are making a huge French restaurant fire; they are making an Andreamosis when they run away in the fancy Vulta's yacht; and Ingelish is totally anarchist in his attempt to use a similar reality assessment to learn about the inner structure of Walta's house.
There is no doubt that all efforts are being made to lead to the last sequence, but despite the affections and the indignities, it has a sense of TV for children.
Pretty mid-level.
Like the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help but think: Can the British movie industry not give Rwan Atkinson a role that really does justice with his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it's making a plan for the British to work four days a week, but get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbin's Leavor Party is considering a revolutionary plan that the British will work four days a week - but will receive payment for five days.
According to reports, the party wants company leaders to transfer savings as a result of an artificial understanding revolution (AI) to employees in the form of another day's rest.
I mean, employees will have a three-day weekend, and they'll still get the same salary.
Sources say that the idea fits the economic agenda of the company and its plans to target the country for the benefit of the employees.
Congress of professional unions supports the transition to a four-day work week as a way for employees to enjoy economic changes.
A leading source at the Labour Party said to Sandy Times: "In terms of policy, it is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but it's a four-day week of work where the party's approach to economic resuscitation for employees, as well as to the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Liberian Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party called for a four-day work week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, the desire is not supported right now by the Labour Party as a whole.
"A four-day work week is not a party policy and the party does not consider it."
Lybour candidate for the Treasury Minister, John McDonnell, used the party conference last week to draft his vision for a socialist economic revolution.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the "invisible managers" and the "price earners" of the service companies.
It also follows from the plans of the treasure minister that current shareholders and shareholders of water companies may not be able to get their full investment back because the Liberian government may do less on the basis of undeserved conduct.
It also confirms that there are plans to bring employees together to the boards of directors of companies and to create a total of 10 per cent of the capital of companies in the private sector for employees, to be introduced into a two-year dividend drug of up to 0.0000.
Lyndsey Graham, John Kennedy told the TV show "60 minutes" if the FBI investigation of Kawano would change their mind.
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Bert Quano delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court at least a week, raising the question whether the investigation findings could convince the Republicans to withdraw their support.
On the idea that Sunday was broadcast on the 60-minute program, writer Scott Fly asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their mind.
Looks like Kennedy was more open than his partymate from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Quano.
I called him after it happened, the charge went up, and I said, 'Did you do it?''
He was decisive, determined, simplistic."
It seems, however, that Graham's vote was grounded in rock.
"I've already decided on Bert Cavaneau and there's gonna be a need for a blasted charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Burt has denied it in force," adds Graham, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
And no man she mentioned could confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see how something can change."
What is the World Civil Festival and did it contribute to reducing poverty?
Saturday New York dates the World Civil Festival, an annual music event with the most impressive list of stars that will appear and an impressive target of an end to world poverty.
The World Civil Festival, which is held this seventh time, will bring to it tens of thousands of people who will live on a large street in Central Park not only to enjoy such shows as Janet Jackson, Cardi Bee and Sean Mend, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of the event - to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Civil Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it actively.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless willing to pay for a VIP card), the concert island must complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, calling or other significant ways to help raise awareness to end poverty.
But how successful has the festival really been, when it's only 12 years ahead of him to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of giving a free ticket to people to this concert really a way to convince them to require a call for action, or is it another case of clictivism -- people who feel like they're really influencing by signing a giant on the Internet or sending a comeback on Twitter?
Since 2011, the World Civil Society has been documenting more than 19 million actions by its supporters, in an effort to achieve a variety of different objectives.
These actions have helped world leaders to declare commitments and policies worth over $37 billion that would affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and pledges as a result of its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already started to be distributed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds that have been set up so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the core commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partner of investors and doing people who are committed to helping children grow to full potential, and promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help put an end to the provision of nutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter needs from the "Citizens of the World".
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and ‘world citizens’ like you, we can become social justice on the subject of sub-nourished observations in history”, said the Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition Tracy Olman to the audience during the London live concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the pace of the project, Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children with nutrition intervention.
In response to one of the most common questions on their website, "What makes you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
"This will be a long and difficult course -- sometimes falling and failing.
But, like the big movements ahead of us of civil rights and resistance to Parthead, we will succeed, because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendez, Cardi B and Janelle Mona are among the events that will take place during the New York Year event, which will serve Bee-li Forens and Joe McMan.
The U.S. could use the Navy for the need for a marine quarantine to delay the export of Russian energy -- the Minister of the Interior.
In the medium of need, Washington could use the Navy to prevent the arrival of Russian energy on the markets, including the Middle East, and discovered the American Secretary of Face Ryan Zink, as quoted at Washington Examinr.
Zinc claimed that the Russian involvement in Syria, which is important to recall, in the legal government order, is an attempt to spread to new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said according to the report.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States is able, with our fleet, to make sure that the sea lanes are open and at the time they need to lay siege to make sure that their energy sources do not reach the market," he said.
Zinky spoke to those present at the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that defines itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued his words and compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, stating that they were indeed the same.
"The economic possibility for Iran and Russia is, more or less, fuel financing and replacement," he said, referring to Russia as "one-trick pony" because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at the time when the Trump government went out to step up its twisted natural gas export to Europe, replacing Russian energy sources, which are a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump's government officials, and all the President of the United States, Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to cancel its participation in the "undeserved" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, has turned Berlin into Moscow's "shobo" project.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the pipeline project has dropped 2 streams, costing 11 billion dollars, and is supposed to double the current channel capacity to 110 billion square metres, is a financial project only.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's deliberate opposition to a project is prevented only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure weapon and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers", said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting in Moscow with the U.S. Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, in September.
The U.S. position was granted a response against Germany's wrath, which reconfirmed its commitment to the project.
The BDI, the leading organization of the German industry sector, called on the United States to stay away from the European Union's energy policy and from the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state is meddling in our energy supply," said Dieter Campef, head of the German Industrial Organization (FDI), following a recent meeting between the German chancelle Angela Markle and the President of Russia and Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, "Truely consider running for the presidency" in 2020, said the senator from Massachusetts.
The senator from the Wessett Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she was seriously considering the possibility of running for the presidency after the middle-school election.
Warren confirmed her intention to run for the president during a meeting in Hollock City, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government, and for that reason, there's a need for a woman to head," she said, according to The Hill newspaper.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider the race for the presidency."
Warren expressed her opinion on President Donald Trump during the meeting in town and said he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
I'm worried until my bones are amputated about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been visiting Trump on the appointment of Bert Cavaneau as a judge in the Supreme Court.
"Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey published on the day ‘ Showed that the majority of Warren’s voters themselves do not think she should run for the 2020 elections.
Fifty-eight percent of the "potential" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not run for election, according to a survey by the University of Suffoc and Boston Globe Political Research Centre.
Thirty-two percent supported the intention to deal with the senator's presidency.
The survey showed that there was a lot more support for the ex- Governor's run, Deval Patrick, with 38% supporting his run against 48 percent who opposed her.
Easier characters from the Fat Democratic Party in connection with possible elections to the 2020 elections include former Vice-President Joe Beedan and Senator Mormont Bernie Sanders.
Beiden said he'd make an official decision in January, according to APF reports.
Sarah Pillin is referring to the traumatic post-Plein stress disorder at Donald Trump's arrest.
26-year-old Trac Pileen in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with an incident of family violence on the day of 'night'
"What's going on with my son, what's been going on since he got back, allows me to identify with families who experience the consequences of PTSD disorder and with some of the injuries that our soldiers are returning," she told the audience that they were taking part in a stop for Donald Trump in the city of Tolsa in Oklahoma.
Fileen called her "the elephant in the room" arrest and said about her son and other released soldiers, "They come back a little different, they go hard, they go back and wonder if what we gave the country to their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all the other military men, is respected."
He was arrested on a day in Wesilla, Alaska, and accused of assault and domestic violence against a woman, disrupting the report of family violence and holding a weapon under a lease, according to Dan Bennet, the Vassil police officer.
18 countries and the province of Colombia support the challenge of new State asylum policy
Eighteen states and Columbia province support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy which refuses to provide shelter to victims who escape situations where gang violence or family violence is involved.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filled out a statement of the type "Court friend" in Washington on the day and in support of the challenge of asylum seekers' policy reading, according to the NBC report.
The full name of the complainant at Grace v. Schens, who filed the American Civil Rights Union in August, was not revealed.
She said that her partner and his violent sons, the gang friends, abused her but that official factors in the U.S. government rejected her request for shelter on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace's state senators described the countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of which are applying for asylum in the United States as nations dealing with many problems with gangs and family violence.
The U.S.'s new State haven policy repealed a decision from 2014 of the BIA Migration Appeals Council that allowed migrants without certificates fleeing situations of family violence to apply for State asylum.
The Attorney General of Columbia County, Carl Rasin, said in a statement on the day and "the new policy ignores decades of state law, federal and international law".
“Federal law requires that all discussions concerning State asylum requests be based on the facts and special circumstances of the request, and the new policy barrier violates this principle”, stated in the court friend statement.
The lawyers also claimed that the policy, which prevents the entry of migrants, hurts the US economy, because they tend to become initiatives and "provide necessary work", they say.
The Attorney General, Jeff Sachens, ordered immigration judges not to provide further State shelter for victims of family abuse and gang violence in June.
“The State haven is open to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of racial, religious, national or social group or political opinion, ” Schensen said in a notice on the policy delivered on June 11.
The aim of the country's asylum would never have been to ease all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Pallo, while where the deaths are doubled, in a race to find survivors
For the survivors the situation has become more difficult than a moment.
"There's a very tense feeling," said 35-year-old Rissa Cosma and if a baby is cut off from the heat at the center of the ponies in the ruined city of Pallo.
Every moment the ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is rare."
The inhabitants appeared to be returning to their destroyed homes, living among stony objects, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 earthquake, were flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Dewey Harris, who suffered back and shoulder crises, lay outside Palo's military hospital, where they were treated for severe minor trauma that they pulled after the earthquake.
Tears filled his eyes as he told how he felt about the violent earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor that parted with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris said to the A.P.A., adding that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then silenced.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're in a safe place."
The U.S. Ambassador blames China for "Brubs" with propaganda ads.
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in U.S. state-of-the-art magazine, while aggressively promoting the benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador of China accused Beijing of using American press to disseminate propaganda.
The President of the United States Donald Trump, on the last day, referred to the supplement to the payment of the Chinese newspaper "China Daily", in the United States of America, in the most widely sold newspaper in the state of Eva, after accusing China of attempting to vote for the American Congress on 6 November, claiming that China had rejected it.
Trump's accusation of China attempted to interfere with the U.S. elections, marked a new phase, according to official sources in the United States, in the Washington peace campaign aimed at putting pressure on China.
Although foreign governments are now known for promoting trade, Big'ing Washington is now stuck in a war of commerce, where every country is raising and comparing its customs rates on products brought from its own.
The customs ships, which China raised as a reward at an early stage of the trade war, were intended to harm Israelis from countries such as Iwa who supported Trump's Republican Party, said American and Chinese experts.
Terry Bernstad, United States Ambassador to China, former Governor of Iva for many years, and an important investment of agricultural goods to China, said that Big'ing hurt employees, farmers and American businesses.
China, states that Bernstad, in his Day A edition of the de Moyen Reggeister, “encourages the acts of bullying by publishing ads in our free press”.
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses America's tradition of freedom of speech and precious journalism, and publishes a payment notice in de Moyin Register, ” wrote Bernstad.
“On the contrary, in the press platform on Beijing Street, you'll find a few opposing votes and not see any real reflections of the different opinions that the Chinese may have on the disturbing economic path, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party”, he wrote.
He added that “one of China's most prominent newspapers has avoided the offer to publish”, although he has not mentioned what newspaper it is.
The Republican Party distances women's voices before middle-school elections with the Quano incident, warning analysts
While many of the Republican party leaders stand by the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bert Quano and protect him in the presence of a number of charges of sexual assault, analysts warned that they would see a response against, especially from women, during the forthcoming mid-secondary elections.
The feelings around this were particularly vivid, and most Republicans officially expressed their desire to move forward in the voting process.
“It is not possible to reverse this kind of stuff”, said Grant Rieder, a professor of state science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, in an article published in The Hill on Saturday.
Rihr said he doubted that the recent recent efforts of Senator Jeff Flick to open an FBI investigation would be enough to make a lot of angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday -- they are not going to forget it tomorrow rather than November", she said on the day and day "Carin Z'an-Pierre, Senior and National Counselor of MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On the morning of November, protestors called out in the Senate Hall, while the Republicans in the Senate Judicial Committee chose to continue to promote the appointment of Quano, despite Dr. Christine Blyzy Ford's testimony, according to a report from the Mic website.
"The levels of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break new ones," said Stu Rottenberg news site, a non-party political analyst.
People say they've been tall; they're right.
But they can be higher, especially among the voices of women in the wild and among young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, despite their lack of appreciation for the President, are often prevented from voting."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which cleared the charges of sexual assault of the High Court candidate, the analysts claimed that a response could be countered if the Republicans continued to advance the authorization of the appointment.
“Appointment has caused the Republicans serious trouble”, said Michael Steele, chairman of the former National Republican Commission, at the beginning of last week, the NBC News channel report.
“It is not only the vote of the committee, the final vote, or the appointment of Kawano, but also the way in which the Republicans handled it and the way in which they dealt with it”, he mentioned to G-Sicill's news channel, the director of Priorities USA, a group that helped with the selection of democracies.
However, the Americans seem to have a somewhat different view of the extent of their faith in saying Ford and Cavanaugh's wishes, with a slightly higher support in Ford.
YouGov's latest survey, shows that 41 percent of respondents believed in Ford's testimony for sure or most likely, while 35 percent said they believed for sure or probably for Kiwano.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that Kawano lied with certainty or probably during his testimony, while only 30 percent said that about Ford.
After the click by Flick, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford as well as the charges raised by at least one other complainant, Bee Ramírez, according to reports in the Guardian newspaper.
Ford testified to the Senate Legal Committee last week that Quano attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court exposed his organ to her during a party at Yale University in the '80s.
Creating the global Internet is planning to start a new Internet to overcome Google and Facebook.
Tim Burners-Ly, a global Internet developer, launchs a Start-Ap company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of the man who became a legend in the world of technology, is a company that opens up Solid, the open code platform of Berners-Ley.
A solid platform allows its users to choose where to store their data and who to access the different types of data.
In an interview without the Fast Company, Burners Lee joked that the meaning behind Inrupt is "control in the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the Start-up.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create a "personal database" or POS.
The database could include a list of contacts, lists of performance actions, timetables, music library and other personal and professional tools.
Imagine that Google Drive, Microsoft Otlock, Sloak and Sputy will be available on the same page at the same time.
What specializes in the personal database is that only the user will decide who can access the information and what type of information can be accessed.
The company calls it “personal strength through data”.
According to John Bruce, company director, it means that Inrupt will find the resources, processes and capabilities that are appropriate to assist in the solid attack for all.
The company now includes Berners-Ley, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team that includes several developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer code programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create specific applications using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Burners Lee said that he and his team were not discussing with Facebook and Google about their agreement or refusal to bring about a complete change, which would cause a complete reversal and a overnight son in all their business models.
"We're not asking them for permission."
In Post, published in the Media on Saturday, Berners-Ley wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and environmental systems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in the Solid.
In 1994, Berners Lee changed the Internet when he set up the network installation, W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners Lee had a voice that had an effect in discussing net neutrality.
Even during Inrupt, Berners-Ley will continue to serve as the founder and manager of the W3C organization, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm especially optimistic about the next age of the network," adds Burners-Ley.
Bernard Van: Event to mark the religious man who won the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only religious man from the English Church who won, as a warrior, the Victoria Cross during World War I was mentioned at an event that took place in his hometown 100 years after it was won.
Lieutenant General Bernard Van, won the Victoria Cross on September 29, 1918 for his participation in an attack on Belenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never found out he had won the highest British honor.
The stone of victory was revealed by two of his grandsons, on a march in the Jordan, Northampton County, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that the excussion of the stone was just 100 after his grandfather won the "simulatoryly symbolic".
According to the London Gate newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant General Van led his regiment and crossed the San Canton Canal, "the heavy fog road and heavy fire ass from a field cannon and under a machine gun".
Then he rushed into the fire line and led the line forward before we were forced to take one hand over a sub-gun and dropped three of the group.
Lieutenant General Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - one month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never compare to but something that stimulates me with humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also left behind a stranger after the march, who led the Brentwood Royal Youth Orchestra.
Michael Van said he was "highly honored to take part in the march" and added "the power of a real hero is demonstrated by the support given to many people".
The combined art fans of fighting stayed awake all night to watch Balator 206, and instead they got Pepa Page.
Imagine that you've been staying in town all night to watch the blackout of the 206 Alter and eventually to watch the central event have been taken away from you.
The program from San Jose included 13 battles, including six on the main ticket, and was shown live during the night on British Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Jared Mossey and Rory McDonald prepared for battle, British viewers remained shocked when the survey changed to Pope Page.
Some of them were not impressed with the change after they stayed up until the early morning hours to watch the battle.
One fan described on Twitter the transition to a child painting movie as a kind of sick joke.
"It's a government arrangement that is scheduled for 6 a.m. to fit the original content, so they had to go through the children's plans", said Dave Schwartz, vice president for marketing and communication in Balator, when asked about the transmission.
"Pippa pig, yes."
President Balator, Scott Coker, said they were going to work on their schedules to include the future British viewers.
"I think when I think about the re-transmission, I think we can probably figure it out," said Coker.
"But it's six in the morning on day one there and we can't solve the problem until day one in our time zone, that's on the day in their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, at the time of the transition, a lot of text messages were exchanged between the sides and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix this. We thought it was a technical collision.
But no, it was a government problem.
I can assure you that next time it's not gonna happen.
We only clean five fights instead of six -- as we usually do -- we tried to give the fans more and just overrun.
It's a thing of ingratitude."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt inferior 'cause of his sexual orientation
Tom Daily, the Olympic jumper to water, said that while he was growing up, he felt inferior to all others because of his sexual tendency -- but that feeling gave him the motivation to make a success.
The 24-year-old jumper said he didn't know until he got to the middle school that "not everyone like me."
In an interview given by Desert Island Discs of Radio Channel 4, under Lauren Lawn's guidance, he said that he had expressed himself on the subject of gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympic games.
The usual host of the old program, Christy Young, has been on a several-month-old sick leave.
In his performance as Lauren's first plan star, Daley said that he felt that the others then felt inferior when he grew up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, the feeling of inferiority, and the different feeling, there were real things that gave me the power and power and allowed me to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was something, he said, so not to disappoint everyone when he finally found out what his sexual orientation was.
The man who twice won the Olympic Hard Medal became a sweet leader of the Lethals Community campaign and used his participation in the British People's Games in Australia this year to call on other countries to give legal status to homosexuality.
He expressed himself openly on the subject because he felt lucky that he had been given the opportunity to live in an open and without consequences and wanted to give others “hope. ”
The World Cup winner said that falling in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met me in 2013, "I was caught by surprise."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than him last year, but he said that the surfing was never a problem.
"When you're so young" -- he was in the Olympic games for the first time at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone his age who had similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, a white man named Robert Ray Black Daily, and Dili said that his "every point of view" had changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, everything around me," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with cancerous brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't accept the fact that he was dying and that one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets to London's 2012 Olympic Games -- because he wanted to be first line.
"I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be here to be in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand while his breath stopped and only when he really stopped breathing and died did I finally know that he wasn't overcome," he said.
A year later, Daily competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the Red Medal.
"I just knew that I'd been dreaming about this all my life -- sneaking in front of a home audience in the Olympic games, it didn't feel much better than that," he said.
That's also what inspired him to choose his first song -- Proud of the Samel -- that he was identified during the preparation for the Olympic games and still makes him a duck skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC 4 on the first day of 11:15, according to the British summer watch.
Michaelson was disappointed in the performance and went down to the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American golf player Phil Michaelson will set a record on day one when he plays the 47th time at the Ryder Cup, but he'll have to upgrade the performance so that the event doesn't become a sad sign.
Michaelson, who participated in the 12th anniversary event and set a record, went down to the bench according to Jim Fiorrick's decision during the football games and the two footballs on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he was accustomed to playing games with the U.S. team, Michaelson, who won five times at the Major's tournament, spent the day as a source of encouragement and the second half working on his side game in the hope of repairing the ill patient he suffered.
So 48-year-old Michaelson is not the ideal choice for La golf National, where the long grass tracks are not usually forgiven for misbehavior.
And if the competition itself is not refreshing enough, Michaelson, at the ninth game on day A, ran against the exact British champion, Francesco Molinari, who cooperated with the starting player Tommy Fletwood and won all four of their games this week.
If the U.S. ambition, which lost four points at the start of the 12 single games, would have been successful in the first stages, Michaelson's game could have been terrible.
Fiorrick expressed confidence in his actor, though we didn't expect him to say anything else.
"He fully understood his job today, dug it on my back, covered his arm around me, and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Pyurek.
He's got a lot of self-confidence.
He was a member of the hall of glory and added a lot to these teams before, and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's how it developed and that's how we thought we should go on.
He wanted to be on track, just like all the other players."
Michaelson's gonna break Nick Faldo's record with the highest number of games in the Ryder Cup on day one.
That's how his career at the Ryder Cup could end, which never really matched his personal record peaks.
Michaelson's prize is 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven skirts, although Pyurek said his presence added certain intangible advantages to the team.
"He's funny, sarcotic, snoon, he likes to make fun of people, and it's fun to be with him in the dressing room," he explained.
“ I think the younger players enjoyed having fun with him this week, and it was nice to see it.
There's a lot beyond the game itself."
The European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great advantage may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from a significant experiment before the last day in the only games of the Ryder Cup that could change badly.
The Danish actor started playing in Waldrama in 1997, when his partner, Grandpa Blastros, had a five-point advantage over the Americans, which he lost almost when he crossed the finish line with a minor advantage and won 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"I keep reminding myself that we had a great advantage in Waldrama; we had a great advantage in the game in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in the Waldrama where we won but with a minor advantage", said Byron, in the picture, after watching the victory 5-3, at the 2018 tournament, they were on the day and "and yesterday, which led to 10-6 Bella golf national.
So history will prove to me and to everyone on the team that it's not over.
We have to give it all tomorrow.
We need to get on track and do all the right things.
It's not over until the cod is on the board.
We've got a goal, trying to win the Cup, and we need to focus on it.
I said all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of those who stand in front of us on the other side -- the best players in the world."
Bjorn was happy with the performance of his players on the difficult golf course and added: "It's important for me never to go ahead with the late at all about golf.
Tomorrow can be completely different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on personal performance, which is completely different.
It's a pleasure to be on track when everything goes well, but when you're there alone, then your full ability as a golf player is on test.
And that's the message you need to convey to the players: you need to produce the best of yourselves tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving the couple behind and he needs to make the best of himself."
In contrast to Bjorn, the captain of the rival team, Jim Fürich, would expect better personal performance than his players, compared to their performance in the match games, except for Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Férique himself knows the winning side and the losing side, during the important completion days of such tournaments, after he took part in the winning team in Brooklyn before losing, when a European team that managed to win a miracle in the final game, as documented in Miracle at Medinah.
"I remember every word and word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players towards the last day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but I want to succeed in the first stages, as you've seen in Brooklyn, and as you've seen in Medinah.
When this moment moves to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We're making our ride accordingly and putting the guys on track as we feel, you know, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the struggle, and he'll face Rory McLroy at the top game, with Paul Cassie, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fletwood and Ian Polter, who are the rest of the Europeans in the top half.
"I chose this fine team of players because I think he'll get us done," said Byron when he was referring to his only choice.
The arrival of the New Warship of Germany was rejected again.
Germany's new fleet privilege was to be accepted in 2014 to replace the warships aged from the cold war period, but it was denied at least one year, due to defective systems and low cost, reported local communications.
The reception of Rheinland-Pfalz, the leading ship in the new Baden-Wuerertemberg-class patent line, was now rejected until the first half of 2019, according to the report of the newspaper Dee quoted a military speaker.
The boat was supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying issues after the supply were stifling the exponential project.
All four Baden-Wuerertemberg-class, which the Navy had ordered in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-clases.
They're expected to have a powerful cannon, anti-flight and anti-ship rocket batteries, as well as escape technologies, such as acoustic signatures, infra-red and low radar.
Other important features, including longer maintenance periods, could be the most important new features for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the meaning of repeated delays is that the new ships - which are supposed to allow Germany to send overseas forces - will become obsolete until the moment they enter service, say quite a quote.
The F125 F-lucks F-Prigata came to the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy built a ship to build ships after it was delivered.
Not much is known about the reasons behind the return, but the German press quoted a critical number of "programming and worsening" that made the warship useless for the use of a battle mission.
The software bends were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fleet would be activated by about 120 sailors -- as half of the team used in the older Bremen Classes.
In addition, it has been discovered that the ship has a dramatic excess of weight that reduces its performance and limits the fleet's ability to add future steps.
The ship's weight of the Rheinland-Pfalz is 7,000 tons, and it is twice as heavy as two similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the locomotive software, the price tag of the project rule - which also includes team training - also becomes a problem.
She came from rumors of an alarming height of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) over the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that fuel the newest aspects are becoming especially evident in the light of recent warnings that the German naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Pater Bartles, head of the German Parliament Security Committee, confirmed that today, the Navy's fleet of ships capable of carrying out a breach.
The official source said that the problem had accelerated and worsened over time, because old ships had been taken out of service but had not been replaced with other vessels.
He expressed his regret that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-clasc type of frigata could have been joined.
Scotland National Foundation listens to the secret life of bats
A new research conducted at the Scotland Mountains is revealing the way bats use landscapes to hunt their food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future preservation activities.
The research carried out by scientists at the Scotland National Foundation will be followed by available bats and European bats as well as by the brown and long-eared Dovanton bats in the Inbrio Gardens in Westero Ross.
Special tapes will be located on key sites around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
The National Health Service (NHS) team and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
A specialized sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the calls of the bats and who among the species responsible for them.
At the next stage, the map of the areas of life has been charted to create a detailed picture of the size of the viewer's face, their patterns of behavior.
Most e-mails, a Nature Conservation Adviser for the national fund of Scotland (NTS), hope that the results will find out which areas of life are the most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the advantages of the management of the areas of life, such as the creation of brotherly labor and how best to maintain the forest floors for bats and other connected species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout Britain has been significantly reduced during the previous century.
They're under threat from development and construction work, which affects the nesting and loss of living areas.
Spirit and light turbines can also pose a risk, and this is true of fly traps and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, bats' ears are more useful when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated DNA tracking techniques to locate insects and identify obstacles to their flight path.
The NTS Foundation, which is responsible for the treatment of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important genes and 760,000 acres of land throughout the country, is very serious about bats.
She's got 10 skilled experts, who do surveying, maintenance tests, and sometimes rescue.
The organization also created the first and the first bats' unit in the possession of the T.R. in Demprez and Galavie, which is home to eight out of ten of Scotland’s bats.
The head of the estate, David T. Thompson, said the estate is the ideal territory for them.
This is B'Rab. We have a great area for bats, he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the appropriate areas of life.
But many things are still not known about bats, so the work we do here and other assets will help us understand what they need to do to thrive."
He stressed the importance of testing to find bats before carrying out maintenance work within the assets, since the unintended destruction of a single populated nest could destroy up to 400 females and females, and could also destroy a whole local population.
The bats are a protected species and killing, harassment and disruption of bats or destruction of their nesting areas, prohibited by law.
Elizabeth Pearl, a Scottish official at the bat conservation fund, encouraged the public to give a shoulder and help.
She said: "We have a lot more to learn about our bats and most of our species. We just don't know what their population is like."
Ronaldo cancels rape charges while the lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine.
Christiano Ronaldo called the rape charges against him "Pike News", and said that people want to "promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The pioneer of the Portugal and Vivantos teams was accused of rape by an American woman named Catherine Miruga, in the Las Vegas Hotel in 2009.
According to the suspicion he later paid her $375,000 to keep silent about the incident, Dr. Spigel reported on the day and '.
Ronaldo, aged 33, turned to his 142 million followers in Instagram on video, lived a few hours after the charges were published and called the "Pick News" reports.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said yesterday, Pike News, told the player's camera that won a D.A. five times.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's good," added the player to the smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Dr. Spiegel for the charges, which were referred to as "unacceptable report on privacy suspicions", according to the Ritters report.
Counsel Christian Schretz said that the actor would seek compensation for “adversarial damage in the amount corresponding to the violation, and this is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the casino suite of the Casino Palmes Hotel in Las Vegas.
After they met at the Night Club, Ronaldo and Miregra returned, according to the report, to the player's room and the actor allegedly raped her, on the basis of documents filed at Clark County Court in Nuda.
Mira says Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told her he was a "good guy" in "99 percent" who was disappointed in "one-hold".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but they agreed.
Mira says she also went to the police and pictures of her injuries were taken to the hospital, but then she agreed to settle out of court because she felt she was terrified of revenge and was afraid of being humiliated in public.
The 34-year-old girl says she's now interested in canceling the arrangement because she's still suffering from trauma due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Reyal Madrid from Manster United at the time of the alleged attack, and passed the summer to the Italian Eubentus Club in a 100 million euro deal.
BRAKEZIT: Britain will regret the loss of the car manufacturers forever
Britain will regret forever if you lose her status as the world's leading motorist after the Braquette, said British business minister Greg Clark.
He added that the British Toyota-BBC interview, in which he said that if Britain were to leave the European Union without an agreement, it would temporarily stop the production at the Bernstone factory, near Derby, would have been "disquieting".
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effect of the delays at the borders in the case of Barquesite without an agreement could go up in office.
The factory in Princeton, which produces the models of Uris and Aventis of Tuutea, produced close to 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% went to the rest of the European Union.
"From my point of view, if Britain leaves the European Union at the end of March, we'll see the production break at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota Barenston.
Other vehicle manufacturers in Britain raised concerns about leaving the European Union without an agreement and how it would affect cross-border trade, including India, BMW, and Viguar Land Rover.
The BMW company, for example, says it'll close its mini factory in Oxford for a month after the Burksite.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks of the supply chain "in the case of Brczeit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is run on the basis of "just in time", with parts coming every 37 minutes, providing British and the rest of the European Union, to produce cars at the invitation.
If Britain leaves the European Union without an agreement on March 29, it may cause border disruptions, and factors in the sector say they can lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
Toyota won't be able to keep an inventory worth more than a day at the Drebsier factory, says the company, so the production will stop.
Clarke said that Teresa May's "chress" program, outlining Britain's future relationship with the European Union, was "accompanied precisely to prevent these border tests".
"We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best possible agreement, as I said, not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to take advantage of the opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4 Day program.
“The evidence from Taiwan and other vehicle manufacturers is that the possibility of continuing to use the successful system of the supply chains, which we have to date, is absolutely essential”.
Toyota didn't say how long the production break was going to go on, but in the longer term, she warned that the extra costs would damage the competitiveness of the factory and would eventually cause dismissals.
Peter Zubalaris, who has been working in Bernaston for 24 years and serves as the president of the United Union in the factory, said that the union members are more and more concerned: "My experience, if the jobs are reduced, they will never return.
A government speaker said: “We have proposed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union.
Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be dismissed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, in many cases depending on her, may be "repudiate another week" while the battle for the Supreme Court candidate, Bert Quano, continues, said the White House on day one.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller, who investigates the Russian election intervention, links Trump's assistants with Russia and possible disruption of the investigation process by the President.
The gossip in D.C. for months has been on the question whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General and thereby endanger Muller's independence.
Earlier in the month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein Dan could carry a wire to record the conversations with Trump and get the President rejected by means of the 25th amendment of the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on the last day he came to the White House, and according to the reports, he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for the day with Trump, which was held when Rosenstein arrived in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said it would have been better not to fire Rosenstein, but at this point the meeting was rejected to prevent a confrontation with the Senate Legal Committee, where one of the women who accused him of improper sexual conduct, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On the day and ', Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the claims against Kavano, and again rejected the vote in the Senate.
Trump's speaker, Sarah Sunders, showed up on Fox News on day one.
In answer to the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “We haven't set a date yet for the meeting, she may be held this week, and I can see a rejection another week given the high court.
But we look and I'm always happy to update the press."
Some reporters will question this appointment: Sanders has not been reporting on the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the host asked why.
Sunders said that the media rarely came from the "Statistics" of the TV, although she said, "I will not deny that they're taking a stand."
Then she offered to increase the direct link between Trump and the press.
"The President has more questions and answers than any president before him," she said, adding, without quoting evidence: "We've checked the numbers."
The press media will still take place, says Sunders, but "If the press has a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do this many times, and you've seen that we've done it many times over the past few weeks, and meeting together that they can talk to the President of the United States, replace the press instructions."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open meetings or press parties during important visits.
Only his press parties are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have been able to explain the reason for this, on a free show and sometimes strangely in front of literature gathered on the spot.
The Health Service writes to the European Union employees in NHS Scotland and refers to concerns about the Burksite.
The Health Service wrote to the staff of the European Union, who are employed in the national health service of Scotland, to express the gratitude of the country and to request that they stay behind the blacksites.
The Scottish parliament, Jean Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to holding applications for a permanent status for the citizens of the European Union working in its distributed public services.
Ms. Freeman wrote in a letter: “In the summer, the negotiations between Britain and the European Union on the exit continued, and it is moving towards the expected decisions in the fall.
But the British government has also increased its readiness for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this period may be very disturbing for all of you.
That's why I wanted to go back and say how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the team, regardless of his citizenship.
Fellow workers from all over the European Union and the world bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit the patients and congregations we serve.
Scotland is obviously your home, and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abracombi undergoes an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
The rear shield of the University of Tennessee tiger group, Christian Abercombi, underwent an emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury from loss 31-27 on Saturday to the Komodores group at the University of Wenderblatt, reported by Mike Organ of Tanzania.
Rod Reed, the leading coach of Tennessee's university team, told the reporters that the wound occurred shortly before midnight.
"He went to the edge of the field and just collapsed there," said Reid.
The trainers and the medical team gave Abercombi oxygen on the edge of the field and then put it on a stretcher and took it to another test.
An official from the University of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville tribal, that Abercombi was transferred to surgery at Wenderby's medical center.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/size of surgery" and the University of Tennessee are still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Aberkombi is an athletic student and this is his first season with the University of Tennessee after a transfer from Illinois.
He participated in five full-time adjustments before leaving the game, and he picked up his 18-hour package.
Foreign buyers will be taxed with higher stamps when buying property in Britain.
Foreign buyers will be taxed by higher stamps while buying British assets, and the additional revenue will be used to help homeless people, according to the new conservative program.
The move will disable Corbin's moving success to attract new voters.
The stamps are charged to those who don't pay taxes in Britain.
The treasure expects the tax to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher rate of stamp tax when they buy property in Britain - the income supplement will be used to help the homeless, announce Teresa May today.
The step seems to be an attempt to disable Jeremy Corbin’s moving success by attracting young voters, with promises of providing a cheaper housing and focusing on higher incomes.
The stamp tax will be imposed on people and companies that do not pay taxes in Britain, and the revenue addition will strengthen the government's move to help those who are old under difficult conditions.
The payment, which comes as an additional to the current stamp tax, including higher tax levels on second-hand housing and real estate investments for rent, may reach a height of three percent.
The treasure expects the move to raise up to 120 million pounds a year.
According to estimates, 13 percent of London's new assets are purchased by foreign residents, which makes prices rise and makes it difficult for people who first buy an asset to put a foot on the housing ladder.
Many rich areas of the country -- especially capital -- have become "White Cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy only arrives a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp tax to help young people acquire a first home.
He accused large-scale building companies of taking land but not using it, and urged Mae to abandon the cover at a reasonable price and repair Britain's "residence" of housing.
Corbin announced a series of average attractive housing reforms, including house rent control and a "no fault-free" evacuation.
He also wants to give the Council greater power to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I'd dedicate my time to the restoration of the British dream -- that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build lives here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live in Britain, as well as companies that are based in foreign countries, can purchase homes as easily as British residents who work hard.
The dream of becoming owners has become too far for too many people, and the humiliation of sleeping under difficult conditions is too real."
Jack Ross: My ultimate desire is to run Scotland.
The director of Sandland Jack Ross said his ultimate desire is to become the director of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotti enjoys the challenge of the North East Club, which is now in the third place on the first league, three points from the top of the rating.
He moved to the summer light stadium after leading St. Myren back to the first place in Scotland in the last season.
I wanted to play for my country as an actor.
I was once in an international game, and that's what Ross said to the Scottish BBC Sports Sound program.
But when I grew up, I watched the Scotland team play with my dad a lot as a kid, and it was always something that pulled me back.
Anyway, this opportunity will only come if I manage the team."
Sanderland's former directors include Dick Adbuket, David Moise, Sam Aldace, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Foya, and Paulo de Canio.
Aloha Attalik's former manager says he was not afraid to come after such well-founded names in such a big club, after rejecting suggestions from Berensley and Epswich Town in the past.
"For me, success will now be confirmed by whether I can return the club to Farmier League"?
Because of the structure and facilities in this club, he obviously belonged to Farmier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to bring him there, but I can see myself as a success story here only if I can get the club back there."
Ross started his management career only three years ago, after a period as assistant manager in Dhamberton and 15 months as team coach of the Hearts Group.
At the next stage, he helped God’s people to get out of League G and to raise St. Myreen from the abyss to her post as champion in the following season.
And Ross says he's more comfortable than ever during his play career in Claid, Hartelfolk, Polkirk, St. Myren and Milton Academy.
"It was obviously a real crossing," he remembered, about taking command of Elijah.
“ I really believed that the management position was more suitable for me than the game.
It sounds weird because I played all right, I've earned most, and I've enjoyed some of the best.
But an actor's career can be difficult.
There's a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still dealing with you guys all about stress and stress at work, but management just feels right.
I've always wanted to run and now I'm doing it, and I've never felt more comfortable with myself as an adult."
You can listen to the full interview on Sportstone, Day A, September 30, on the Scotland Radio between 12:00 and 13:00, according to the British summer clock.
The perfect time for Pinette beer is at 5:30 on Saturday, found in the poll.
The rising summer heat wave was the profit of the British bars struggling for their existence, but it put pressure on the restaurant networks.
Groups of Babies and Bars enjoyed a 2.7% sales promotion in July - but the restaurant incomes dropped by 4.8 percent, the data were revealed.
Peter Martin, CGA Business Advisory, who collected the data, said: “The significance of the continued clear weather and the long-expected participation of England in the World Cup is that July had a pattern similar to that of June, as the well revenues rose by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants suffered even more severe beatings.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant trading, which was observed in June, is just the worst in July.
Babies and bars that focus on drinks have recorded the strongest performance, with a higher growth than the lower incomes in the restaurant business, compared to the previous period.
Food-focused bears also suffered from the sun, although their condition was less dramatic than that of restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among the Habib and bar networks, the percentage of drinking was 6.6 per cent during the month, and food sales had dropped by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, from the RSM Data Analysis and Hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the effect of sports events or important social events are the most important factors in all aspects of the entertainment market outside the home.
It's not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight, although a decrease of 4.8 percent in sales compared to last year will be particularly painful in addition to all the regular half costs.
Long and hot summer couldn't get any worse to food-focused businesses, and the time would tell if the lower temperatures we experienced in August would bring out what they needed so much."
The total growth in sales at the bars and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, and the slow rate of branding was 2.7%.

One in five children has social media accounts they hide from their parents.
A survey revealed that one in five children — some only 11 years of age — have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
Survey, which included 20,000 middle-school students, revealed a growth on the pages of "False Insta"
The news has raised concerns about advertising sex content.
20 percent of the students said they have a "head" account that they show to parents.
One out of five children — some only 11 years of age — creates social media accounts that he keeps secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle-school students revealed a rapid growth in the "False Insta" accounts as a reminder of the site's image sharing, Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about advertising sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they were running a clean "head" account to show their parents, but they also had private accounts.
A mother who encountered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found that she was asking others to rape me.
The study, carried out by Digital Education UK and HMC of the independent schools in Britain, found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles and a few of them admit that they have private accounts.
HMC Head, Mike Buckenan, said: "The trouble so many young people are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eileed Dale will be used as "A sound for athletes" at the Scottish athletic board.
Eileed Dale was elected to the Scottish athletic board as an external director at the annual General Assembly of the Board of Directors.
In the last decade, he described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who would take the lead in producing the richest sport in the world.
“Illid has been highly respected among the Scottish, British and World Athletes Community, and we are sure that the Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from coming to the board,” says Betty.
"I am eager to serve as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can contribute and really help with the sports guidance in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 and 400 meters in the Olympic Games in 1996 in Atlanta, and only four Olympic gold medals, which are now used regularly in the BBC, has lost his ability to go after a passing brain stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said it's only time to say whether or how much time we're going to get.
It was a wild job, but I've recovered completely. I've learned again how to go and now it's a quick and rapid response operation!
Thank you for your encouraging words!
Publisher for milk pumps compared to mothers for a group of online opinions.
A network-based milk pump company with an awareness that is comparable to a cow milking mother.
To mention the pump bag that is supposed to be the world's “silent milk pump” for private users, Elvie, published a humorist video to demonstrate the operational freedom that the new resource gives to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of cows for the sound of a song with words like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed it's not gums, it's my breasts."
The song symphony goes on and says, "Sucking, pumping, feeding the babies, sucking, pumping, milking my girls."
But the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused a dispute over the network.
With 77,000 observations and hundreds of reactions, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many said he was throwing light on the "threats" of the milk industry.
“ The decision is very bad to use furrows to advertise the product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to make milk, but their babies are stolen from them within a few days after the escape," she wrote.
Elvie's milk pump integrates discreet within the clean bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment said: “Truomatically speaking, the cow and the calf are one.
But hey, why don't you use them to post a milk pump to mothers who have to keep their babies?
Another comment said, "A commercial is completely cut off".
Others protected the commercial, and one woman admitted that she thought that the song was "creeping. "
I think that's a genius idea.
I'd buy one if I still did.
The pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I was referring to her content.
It's a genius product," wrote someone.
Another comment said: "It's a funny commercial for mothers who have a bout (often in their workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like cows.
It's not an awareness that you're praising or judging the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group finds that they were all dancing with the discreet pumps inside their fronts.
The idea that behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women, who use milk resources, say they feel like cows.
But Elvie's pump is completely quiet, with no pipes and strings, it's a discreet combination of the cleaning bra and thus gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even leave during the pumping.
Anna Blarin, a partner and head of the Early Development Department in Mother, stated: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it has received a bold and proactive drink.
By making comparisons between women who express themselves and milk cows, we wanted to put the milk pump and all the challenges it presents in the light of the frogs, and to reflect in a humorous way that can be recognized, the amazing sense of freedom that the new resource will give.
It's not the first time Elvie's resources make headlines.
During London's fashion week, the mother of two children walked on the track for the designer Martha Jacobowski using a product.
Hundreds of my immigrant children were quietly transferred to a tent camp at the border of Texas
The number of immigrant children in Zinc detention despite the fact that several of the monthly crossings remained relatively unchanged, one reason being that the conversation and policy of the director of Trump made it difficult to transfer the children to the foster community.
Usually, the majority of the caregivers were undocumented immigrants, and they were afraid that they could stay in the country by presenting candidates for responsibility for a child.
The risk is a man in June, when the federal authorities have declared that potential sponsors and other older households will have to deliver fingerprints, and these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Alvens, a high official of immigration and the throne, testified to Congress that the authorities had arrested dozens of people who had filed for protection for minors without supervision.
The Authority subsequently approved 70 percent of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80% of the caregivers or homeowners are illegally in the country, and a large part of them are criminals from foreign countries.
That's why we keep chasing these people," said Mr. Alvens.
In order to deal with solutions for children more quickly, officials introduced new laws requiring some of them to appear before a court within a month of their arrest, instead of 60 days as acceptable according to previous regulations, reported to the shelter workers.
Many will show up in a video conference instead of face-to-face to present their arguments for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who will not be allowed to be released will be deported quickly.
The longer these children remain under their protection, the more likely they are to develop anxiety and depression, and the situation may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, said the shelter workers and reports published by the system in the last few months.
Counselors say that these fears are overcome by greater facilities such as tornilo, where it is likely that the child's difficult signs will be ignored because of the size of the facility.
They added that transferring children to a city of tents without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to separate them from friends could make the trauma many are already dealing with worse.
Syria tells the American, French and Turkish conquest forces to retreat too.
She also called for the Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Disappeared, also as Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext that they were fighting terrorism, and "to be treated accordingly."
"They have to back off too unconditionally," he said to stop.
Disappearably, the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to fight this holy battle until we rid Syrian lands of the terrorist organizations and any illegal foreign presence that she is as one.
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly for training and counselling of the rebel and Syrian forces opposing the President in Al Assad.
France has over 1,000 warriors on war-stricken land.
As far as the issue of the refugees is concerned, it has been said that the conditions for their return are good and the charges are "some Western states" in "dispersing unreasonable fears" that motivated refugees to stay away.
"We called the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them return," he said.
They're politicizing the issue that's supposed to be humanist only."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no assistance will be sent to Syria's rebuilding until a political agreement is reached between Ada and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish an Idliv arrow zone, from the last major rebel hold, created an opportunity for political negotiation.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces in support of the Russians on the province, where three million people live.
However, the emphasis on the agreement was “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that the military action would focus on the fighters of the “Jahad”, including those from the victory front linked to the Al-Qaida organization, which was “destroyed”.
UN Envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee, composed of members of government and opposition, to draft post-war rule of law and to pave the way for elections.
The author set conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Commission and said that the work of the panel should be limited to the "to check the steps of the current Constitution", and warned against interference.
Why is Trump gonna win a second degree?
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberals hope, rejection and scandal will end sooner.
While there is no doubt about it, "The most dramatic end in the history of Presidents at all times"!
Right now, there are no signs of fatigue with the viewers.
Since 2014, peak viewing rates have doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
The average of Fox News stands at 2.4 million viewers in peak hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nelson, and the "Rachel Madau Show" broadcast in MSNBC, has reached the head of the ratings of the cable with up to 3.5 million viewers in important news nights.
"It's the fire people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neil Bar, the actual producer of the ABC drama series, the "Survivor Target", who deals with a state secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the capital.
Lanelle Scobel, writing an old comedy and writing "Only the funny parts: ...and some difficult truths about infiltrating into the Hollywood men's celebration" have another theory.
She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
She's a question.
He said, "because he's laughing at me," she told me, "Ms. Scooble."
The chaos and chaos have an inherent value.
Of course, unlike all the other TV programs, the campaign lines coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Ru v. Wade ruling, whether immigrant families could reunite and the health of the world economy.
Replacement of a channel or omission is allowed only the most specialized viewers can afford.
And yet, you're breaking out of the boundaries of being intelligent citizens when you find yourselves watching for six hours on the panel of Danish experts using Bob Woodward as a source for the book Fear, the "Bombers' "Bombers" from a $15,000 answer to Paul Manaport's "dressed clothes", according to Washington Post" and the consequences of Daniels' shocking descriptions of, and sorry for the expression, Trump's anatomy.
I, for example, would never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does, which gives a similar feeling to that of a reality show, is that he feeds you on something every night", said Bert Montgomery, director of the Weelhouse Intert line and creates the program "History for sale", about the replacement team at the Tramp Show and the daily trends in it (war with the NFL League, praise for Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to lose one chapter or stay behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Place this week, it was bright outside with a temperature of about 26 degrees north coast on the island of Kauai, but it closed down to watch the MSNBC, and it recorded the CNN simultaneously.
He couldn't hang up, not when Bert Cavanaugh was ready to stand up to the Senate Legal Committee and the future of the Supreme Court depends on the balance.
I remember the times when we made all these crazy shows before and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Place told me.
I thought it was a joke, but apparently they were right."

External source funds await the race for the closest middle of Congress.
Not surprisingly, the 17th district of Pennsylvania is facing a wave of money, thanks to the reorganization of Congress districts, which brought the race of two congressmen on the same seat.
The county, a furroor of Pittsburgh whose borders have recently been re-established, has placed the Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who has won his seat in another district, in special elections in the last spring.
Lamb ran against another congressman, Republican Keith Rut'fus, who today represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which is very familiar with the borders of the new 17th district.
The maps were reprinted after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the former provinces had been wrongly divided, and, contrary to the Constitution, the results for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a campaign against financial bombings in the campaign between the financial weapons of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Amb became known in Pennsylvania after a victory in the special elections in March, which were widely observed, for the 18th Congress of Pennsylvania.
The seat belonged to the Republicans for over a decade, and President Trump won a 20-point district.
Political judges have seen an easy advantage for the Democratics.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, and then retreated.
Diplomatics have stated that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already met in Beijing, with a slight opposition from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos and Earla, in June 2017 and held the Panama Hotel until his partners fired Trump's management team.
Foreign Office officials decided to return the heads of the United States diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama as a response to the "last decisions not to know more about Greece", said Dr. Novart, speaking to the office, in a statement at the beginning of the month.
But the penalty was imposed only against Salvatore, who, according to the estimate, received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The average penalties, including cuts in economic assistance and entry-based limitations, could hurt a country from Central America with high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America rejected an emergency conference that was supposed to focus on safety and financial prosperity as a continuation of a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from arriving in the United States.
But in the middle of September, high-ranking government officials made clear their desire to promote the conference, thus completing all the sentences against Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Fance should now turn to the conference participants, who are currently scheduled for the middle of October, as a symbol of the importance that the government attaches to him, said the diplomats.
And three American missionaries returned quietly to Al Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or severe punishment from Washington.
The White House speaker for Bolton refused to respond to the details of the debate described by the three American officials, and in all, two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal discussions, provided they remain anonymous there.
Their explanations were confirmed by an external analyst, near the government, who also spoke out there.
Learning History
This is clear from the report of Special Adviser Robert Muller on the alleged disruption of Trump's investigation, whose backs now have significant evidence in the public records.
Muller directs his investigation, according to reports, to the question whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in its attacks on our election system.
If Congress controls change, Trump will find himself judging and accounting for this body, just as he prepares to face the voters again, and perhaps even a jury.
There's a lot of questions starting with "M" and I don't mean to argue that Trump's fall is inevitable -- not even of the equivalent roles in Europe.
From both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers would have been willing to reverse Hitler, if only the West had opposed him and supported him in his fight against Yemen.
We failed, and we missed a chance to prevent the killing years from happening as a result.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and there is an increase in democracy that cannot be stopped, accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein's been in trouble since last year's newspaper reported that he secretly offered to record the president and put forward assumptions about his lack of compatibility with the presidency.
Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
"How do we react if the F.B.I. investigation into Bert Quano, recently requested, is incomplete or unfair - or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible accusations of sexual assault and false commissions?
And above all, will we vote in the middle-of-the-secondary elections and appoint a congressman who will take responsibility for Trump?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter nap.
But I believe we won't fail, because of the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, who also once had the glorious house I had.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light a Saturday candle on the same table on the hook cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorans from Ring's Optimist to the Argument in Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on the fifth day, and they know that after winning the Austrians, after the impressive case against Viral in Spain earlier this month, they will be placed in a strong position to be replaced by Group G on the European League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorans from showing up for the first time in the season until his case 2-2 with Viral, but he believes that ringers can use this result as a leap for better performances.
"It was a good point for us because Viral is a good group," said the 31-year-old footballer.
We went out to the game out of faith that we could get something and get a point.
We could have won at the end, but, by all means, his case was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we left the freezer in the second half and we were the better group.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
I hope we can get three points, but it's gonna be a tough game because they got a good score in their last game, but with the crowd behind us, I'm convinced we can push and get a positive result.
The last year has been really hard, with everything that's happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but there's a good feeling about the place right now.
The group's good and the guys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can move on now, put the last season back and make it.

Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, only a few people were talking about it with their family members.
Half of the participants in the Nationalwide Survey said they were talking to couples about the cost of long-term nursing care.
Only 10% said they talked to their kids about it.
“People want a family to take care of them, but they don't take steps to have the conversation”, said Holly Schneider, vice president of the National Life Insurance Company.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people found their death in an earthquake and a powerful tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo, said official sources, and the death line is expected to rise.
The disaster caused the removal of the media networks and the official factors responsible for the assistance could not obtain information from the Dungala district, an area in northern Palo that was closer to the very source of the noise of 7.5.
In Pallo, over 16,000 people have turned after the disaster struck.

Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Trak Pileen, the eldest son of Sarah Pileen, the government of Alaska and the former vice president of the United States, was arrested on assault charges.
Fileen, aged 29, from the city of Wesilla in Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of family violence, disruption of the report of family violence and resistance to arrest, according to the report published on Saturday by Alaska police forces.
According to the police report, when a mine tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her.
Pileen is held in custody at the Matt-soo Pratreal facility under 500 dollars' own bail, according to a KTUU TV channel report.
According to the network reports, he appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, for sure," when he was asked to unsubstantiate his claims.
Pileen is charged with three A-type conductal offences and can, therefore, be imprisoned for a year and fined for $250,000.
He's also charged with type B conduct, for which a day's sentence can be imposed in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time criminal charges were filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with attacking his father, Todd Fellin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the courthouse for Alaska's released soldiers.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, disrupting the reporting of a crime of family violence, and holding a weapon under a lease in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her face.
Groups of released soldiers were criticized for Sarah Flynn in 2016 after he linked her son's violent behavior to the disruption of a traumatic post from his service in Iraq.

Federal prosecutors seek death penalty rarely suspected of terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York seek a death penalty for Sipolo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been committed for a federal crime in the country since 1953.
30-year-old Siobov used a home Depo rental truck to hit a bike track alongside the West Side Highway in South Manhattan, and a foot-and-wheeler and a biker hit his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims in the first instance and caused serious injuries to the body, according to a statement of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the southern quarter of New York.
According to the court's document, death penalty may be imposed on these two counts.
Weeks after the attack, a federal juror served with an indictment of 22 counts, including eight charges of kidnapping aid, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "important premeditated and deliberate planning", said the prosecutions, and described the manner in which he carried out the attack as "dignified, cruel and sick."
Saipov has caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Ang’ini, Nicholas Clabs, Ann-Lor Deckerd, Darn Drake, Ariel Frochej, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damine Pinhoco, written in the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the southern quarter of New York claimed the death penalty in the case occurred a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but he was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were convicted in connection with an espionage for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, born of Uzbekistan, did not express regret in the days and months following the attack.
He announced to the investigators that he felt good about his actions, said police.
Siopov told the authorities that he was inspired to attack after watching the videos of Dash on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to the police, he also asked to hang a flag of Dash in his hospital room.
He claimed he was innocent in response to the 22-pronged indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal senators representing Siopov, said they were "discouraged of course" by the prosecution decision.
“We think the decision to ask for a death penalty instead of a confession of guilt that would lead to a life sentence without the possibility of release, would only extend the duration of these events to all involved,” said Paton.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the prosecutors not to demand death penalty.
Parliamentman Marani says that we have to appoint Naig to Prague as the negotiating officer for the Brczeit.
Naig'l Frag'n' Dora to recruit the People's Army today during a protest at the Conservatives' Conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must feel pressure from the Arosceptics - when a member of the Parliament of the Teresa May Party claimed that he should be responsible for negotiating with the European Union.
Parliamentary Parliamentary member Peter Boone said he was walking in Birmingham that Britain was already out at this point if Prague was serving as Secretary of the Burksite.
But the challenge facing Mei, the very common lineage of the conservatives, was met by the involvement of conservatives who supported the stay in the European Union for a different demonstration against the Burksite in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to leave her settlement plan, the Churs, on her way despite attacks by the Barksite supporters, the remaining supporters and the European Union.
The allies stood by her continuing to try and reach an agreement with Brussels in spite of the counter-actions and to force the Arosceptics and the Liberian party to choose between her agreement and "thus and chaos,"
Boone said at a meeting of the Leave Means Leave group in Seoul that he wanted to break up with 'Crass'.
He claimed that Prague had to be accepted as a friend and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we'd be out at this point, he said.
Parliamentman Mallingboro added: "I'll protect the Burksite, but we need to break up with Cress."
He stressed his opposition to the European Union and said: “We did not fight in two world wars to be enslaved.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Boone dismissed the claims that since the vote in 2016, the idea that the British people had changed their mind and wanted to stay is totally false.
The conservative parliament and supporter of the Barkasite Andrea Jenkins was also on the march and told the reporters:
The "Churs" program is not popular among the public at large. The opposition will not vote for it. It is not popular among our party and among our activists who went out to the streets and chose us in the first place.
Please, abandon the "Cares" and start listening.
In a critical message intended for May, she added: ‘ Heads of government keep their servants when they keep their promises.’
Prague said at the conference, that politicians should feel the pressure if they're about to betray a decision that was made in the people's wish in 2016.
It's now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political status, 'he said.
They're trying to cheat on Burkasite and we're here today to tell them we won't let you get away from his operation.
He added, in a message to the enthusiastic crowd, I want you to make our political status, who's about to betray Burkasite, feel pressure.
We call the people's army of this country, which gave us the victory in Bracquette and will never rest until we become independent, self-governanced and proud Britain.
At the same time, the remaining supporters walked in Birmingham and then held a two-hour conference downtown.
A handful of active people were blown up in the anti-Braksite proclamations after the group was set up this weekend.
Lybourg Lord Sirs made fun of the opening of the conference for security guards who suffered with the party app.
It's about people who tell us they can have IT systems and all possible technology to make an agreement like Canada plus plus, to cross a border without friction and to trade freely without borders in Ireland,' he added.
It's totally ridiculous.
There's no such thing as a good Burkasite', he added.

Grand Free Russia: Louis Hamilton ends with a world degree after the groups' partnerships gave him a victory over Sebastian Westel.
It was clear, from the moment Walter Botas went up to the next step before Louis Hamilton on Saturday, that the Merceds team would play an important role in the race.
For the first time, Botas had a good start, and he left Hamilton almost alone when he protected his place in the first two rounds and invited Walt to attack his teammate.
Waltel went to middle school first and allowed Hamilton to fit in with the running tail movement, a decision that was probably unsubstantiated.
The Mercedes team went off to mid-circuit later and returned to the race behind Wettel, but Milton moved forward after a tight wheel struggle that eventually had to leave the interior path to survive safely after a double move in the third corner.
Max Varstafan, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back of the rank and was in the seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he led for a large part of the race and did not trade tires to get a quick finish and to get Kimmy Reaconan to the fourth place.
He finally went down to the middle stop in round 44 and couldn't increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds when Reykonan conquered the fourth place.
It's a tough day because Walter did a great job all weekend and there was a real gentleman when he let me get around him.
The team did an extraordinary job to get to Dabel," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump to mock Senator Diane Finstein at a meeting on Saturday, in connection with her insistence not to leak a letter from Christine Blyzy Ford, accusing High Court candidate Bert Quano of sexual assault.
While speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee, and instead said that the Senate shows that people are evil, abusive and liars.
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see angry, evil, and lying people," he said.
When you look at the ads and leaks, then they say "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Finstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... Did you leak the document "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
So, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak," he added in the senator's example.
Finstein received from Ford a letter detailing the charges against Quano another July, and he was leaked earlier in September -- but Finstein denied the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't leak her story," said Finstein to the committee, according to The Hill newspaper reports.
She asked me to keep his confidentiality and to keep the confidentiality of the letter as he asked me to.
But it doesn't seem like the senatorial denial was accepted by the president, who responded to her during the meeting on Saturday night: "I'm telling you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she's not [the leak], but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continued to protect the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, and claimed that the Democratics were using charges for their purposes.
“ They are determined to return to rule at all costs.
You see the misdemeanours, the rabids, they don't care who they hurt, who they run on the way to power and power," said the President, according to a media report.

A plane crashed in Micronesia: Air New Guinea says one person was missing after a plane crash in Blogne.
The airline, which operated the plane crashing in the silence of the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, now says that one person was missing, after stating earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely heading from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a message that started on Saturday afternoon, she could not say what happened to the fate of one passenger.
The airline said she was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try and find the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or his nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the island of Chok.
Officials said the day and 'seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed on Saturday at the hospital and that the situation of all the remaining ones was stable.
The reason for the crash and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The U.S. airline and Navy said that the plane landed in Blogne a short distance from the course.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had missed the course.
American passenger Bill Gaines said the plane had reached a very low course.
"It's a very positive thing," said Gaines.
Gaines said that he and the others managed to clear their way to the water emergency at the altitude of the landing plane.
He said the plane crew was nervous and screamed, and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who worked near a dock were also aided by rescue operations, using an inflatable boat that brought people to the beach before the plane landed in a 30-foot - deep water (100 feet).

Analyst details the course of events the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution proved her case on Saturday, in a repeated trial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi while she was alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roult of the U.S. Department of Justice has been testifying for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used mobile phone records to connect the Prosecutor's movements, the 29-year-old Quenton Talis, and the victim's movements, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night she was murdered.
According to the Clarion report for Jedger, Roult said he had received the location data from a number of mobile phones that had shown that Tiles was with Chambers the night he died, thus hiding his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went out to talk to Sanford.
Sanford came up on the stand and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Talis was telling the truth when he said he was with Sanford that night, Sanford said he was "a liar, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another hiding was that Tallis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The cell phone records confirmed that they only knew each other for a week.
Roult said that some time after Chambers died, Tallis deleted the text messages, the conversations, and the contact details of Chambers from his phone.
He took her out of his life, said Hale.
The defense will start with her closing speech on day one, according to the plan.
The judge said he expected the trial to be transferred to the jury at a later stage that day.

Another black man?
A New York handler sued a couple for dismissal after a "ethnic" text message.
A New York therapist sued a couple for dismissal from a dark background after receiving a text that was not meant for her from the mother who complained that the therapist was another black man.
The couple denied that he was racist and compared the prosecution to "snake."
Lynce Plasco-Flexman, if for two, expressed disappointment when she found out that her new baby nurse, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived at the first day of work in 2016.
"No more black man," wrote Ms. Plasco-Flexman to her husband with text message.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
According to a New York Post report, after paying attention to the spread of the mouth, Plasco-Flexman fired Mrs. Morris, saying that the former African-American therapist had done a bad job, and that she was now expecting to hire a Philippians instead.
Mrs. Morris received payment for one working day and was sent to her house with Ober.
Now, Morris is suing the couple for dismissal, demanding $350 a day for six months of work and living in a place for which he was originally hired, though without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, don't do things like that," she said to Post on the day and "I know it's dark."
The couple fought for the allegations that they were racist, and said that the end of Morris' deal was required, out of fear they couldn't trust her after they hurt her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said her husband Joel Plasco to Post.
But would you entrust your child to someone you were rude to, even if it was an accident?
Your soft baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the prosecution to "snacking" and said his wife was supposed to be born only two months before the event and was "in a very difficult situation".
"You want to go after someone like her?
It's not nice to do something like that," added the investment banker.
The legal case is still in progress, but the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple in social media and eliminated their conduct and the arguments they used.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington's light were afraid readers would not be identified with a talking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkle, born shortly after the book was received, said about the letter: "It's hard to imagine yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it's published.
It's very funny to know now what we know about Peddington's great success."
After she said that her father, who worked at BBC, as a photographer before he was inspired to write the Children's Book with a little toy bear, would become a blood poisoning about his rejection of his work, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "Mary-sweet", after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of Peddington's eventual success, which he described as "a very important friend in our family."
"He was a quiet man, not a proud man," she said.
"But because Peddington was so real to him, it was almost like you had a kid who got something: you're proud of him even though it's not really because of you.
I think he saw Peddington's success like this.
Even though it was his work and his imagination, he always said it was Pedington's own.
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was transferred to the local congregation of Louis Pasteur 2 Benes, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
Ned called in a wash and said her condition was really bad, not expected to last." said Mrs. Ednan-Laprus.
And then I got a call from Ed where he said she was going to die in the next two minutes and I should say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The meds that the doctors gave her so that a phase would continue to be slowly gone and out of her system.
She died sometime before, and it's over. It's all over.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing it's all happening.
I couldn't swim or scream or cry because I was surrounded right now by families and people.
I really had to hold on."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laprus, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane alongside other passengers who were unaware of the journey.
Nobody knew," she said.
My head was a legacy, and tears went down all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had a sense of humor with Ned.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women are hanging out on a bridge to prevent suicide.
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide, working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were hanging on a bridge in Walsch with inspiring messages and phone numbers where people could call to get support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any other parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45-year-old, who lives in Bladeney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone recognized him for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up every room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm constantly afraid of a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis created the disclosures, so people know that there's someone they can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, Mrs. Davis' friend for years, lost Mark, a life partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed or anything else," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was down the stairs on Christmas Day, when the kids opened the presents, he didn't make an eye contact or something."
She said that his death was a tremendous trauma for them, but they got over it: "It creates a hole in the family.
It rips us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Bert Quano's future stands at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought, if we could really get what he asked for -- a time-limited and extensive investigation -- maybe we could bring only to the union," said Flick on Saturday and added that the concern that the committee was "tore apart" in the deep-seated party dead end.
Why were Quaano and his Republican supporters not interested in the FBI investigation?
Their calming is all due to the timing.
The mid-dunction elections will take place only five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans will not be able to do so, they will be very weak in their attempts to bring the man they want to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to try to support them in Quano, who worked at the White House for Bush and met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI takes out his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where today 51 republics and 49 democracies stand.
It's still not clear whether Quano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice-President Mike Fance to break his equality and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of Iraqis in North Korea rose under Kim
A number of North Korean Arabs to South Korea have been down since Kim Jong-on came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean lawman.
Bong Sig Park, quoted data from the South Korean Union Office and said that last year the number of Arabs stood at 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the main factors were a deeper revision of the boundaries between North Korea and China and above in terms of money from human smugglers.
Pyongyang didn't make a public statement.
The vast majority of North Korean Iraqis end up in South Korean citizenship.
According to Sewell, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them are running through China, where North Korea has the longest border, which is easier to cross compared to the military field (DMZ), which has been well maintained between two Korean states.
China treats Greeks as illegal and not as sinners and often forcibly brings them back.
The relationship between the North and the South -- technically still in war -- has improved considerably in the last few months.
Earlier, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks focusing on negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
The meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump and Kim Jung-un, Singapore, where the two generally agreed to act towards a time when half of the Korean island would not hold a nuclear weapon.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the sanctions that have cast the U.S. at the lack of progress since then.
Without trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there will be no chance that we will unilaterally break down our weapons first, says Rie in his speech to the U.N. General Arrest in New York.
Nancy Flossy calls Bert Quano Histori, saying he doesn't fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the electorate, Nancy Flossy, called the High Court candidate Histori and said that his character did not allow him to serve in the Supreme Court.
Flossy responded to this on a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever appeared like that, they'd say "historic", "Plussy said about her reaction to the evidence of Kavano before the Senate's Legal Committee on Day Two.
Quano was very excited about the allegations of sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blyzy Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kawano was very emotional, and sometimes he screamed and suffocated when he spoke about his family and his high school years.
He also condemned, in effect, the Commission's Democratics and called for arguments against him, namely, "The murder of a compatible character and Grotsky" which was organized by the liberals' anger over the fact that Hillary Clinton lost his election to the presidency in 2016.
Flossy said that Kawano's testimony had proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed a prior view against the democracies.
"I think he took himself with these statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Flossy hesitated when she was asked whether she would try to remove the Quano if Minho was happy, and if the democracies won most of the House of the Chosen Ones.
"He says so -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit, not only for a high court priest, but also for a court where he's currently a priest," said Flossy.
Quano is currently serving as a judge in the Federal Court of Appeal of Columbia County.
In addition, she has concerns about possible cessations of Kawano against Obama's health reform or the judgment of Wyde's court, since he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavano avoided wishes regarding the possibility of cancelling certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"There's no reason for a hysterical and bribed person to come to court and watch as it says, "That's not great," said Plussy.
And women should use it.
It's a bad criticism, months and years of anger on his back, and she can't express them without crying.
"We're crying when we're upset," told Ms. Steinum 45 years later.
I don't think it's rare, do I?
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager elsewhere, who said that she also cried when she got upset, but she developed a technique and every time she got upset and started crying, she used to tell the person she was talking to, you might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are more likely to get angry, among the others because they are not aware of what they are.
One of my most significant memories of early in my life, in the office with most of my men, is that I once found myself crying in in inexplicable anger, and an older woman caught my back, it was a cold manager from which I was always a little scared -- and dragged me to the stairs.
"Don't let them see you ever cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're getting angry.
They think you're sad and they're gonna be happy that they've been able to suppress you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was at the time a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during the election trips for the presidency.
In 1987, when Art caught an extramarital affair on a ship named Monkey Business and left the race, Schroeder, who was deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason for her not to consider the idea of dealing with the presidency herself.
"It wasn't a decision I thought of well," she told me 30 years later and laughed.
“ There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they had to do was deal with another.
Someone called it "the snow and the seven darts."
Because she joined the election at a late stage, she graduated from the fund-raising, so she swore she wouldn't join the race unless she recruited $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She found out some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"They think I'm getting a discount?" She was wondering.
At the time of the announcement of not opening up an official campaign, the feelings awaited her so much -- gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that so much had to be set aside to raise money, focus on voters instead of representatives, and anger at sexual intimacy -- she was moved with tears.
"May have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Röder recalled in a way the press responded to her.
"You could have thought I'd been sponsored by MacLinks.
I remember thinking, what would they write about my situation?
"She cried"?
How the U.S.-China Trade War can be useful for Beijing
The opening lines of the U.S.-China trade war were earwives, and although the battle is far from over, a tear between the countries may be useful for long-term Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the opening shot earlier this year when he taxed important export products of China and, in general, solar, steel and aluminium.
The most significant Islam took place this week with new values affecting products worth $200 billion (150 million LTL), taxing in fact half of the goods exported to the United States from China.
Big'ing responded at the same time in the same currency, and she recently raised the prices by five to ten percent for 60 billion dollars of American goods.
China has committed itself to bringing back a hit on every U.S. hit, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will surrender in the near future.
A request from D.C. to return meant that she would submit to her demands, but a public Kada to the United States would be too embarrassing for the President of China, Shei Ginfing.
However, experts say that if Big'ing manages properly, the pressures from the trade war with the United States could positively support China in the long term, and narrow the inter-economic dependency.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of economic liberalization in each country is actually much more dangerous than was previously seen by India”, said Abigail Grace, a research partner focused on Asia, in the New American Security thinking group.
Syria's ready to return to the refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says it's ready to return willingly to refugees and call for help to rebuild the country that was destroyed in a long war that lasted over seven years.
In a speech to the arrest of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mawf said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Now the situation in a more stable and secure area thanks to the progress achieved in the war on terrorism”, he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to restore the situation.
All the conditions now exist for the free return of the refugees to the country they left because of terrorism and the unilateral economic steps that were designed to harm their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mossev said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the devastated state.
But he stressed that the regime would not receive grant or state aid that we named the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Rider Cup for 2018 and defeated the U.S. team as a result of a final 16.5 - 10.5 track of La golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost so far six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe was once again crowned when Captain Thomas Byron's team arrived at 14.5 points to win the United States.
American star Phil Michaelson, who fought all the way through the tournament, sent his T-thing to the water on the 16th floor of Par-3, and lost the game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari was brilliant in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who had reached 5-0-0 since the beginning of the tournament in 1979.
American actor Jordan Spath was defeated by the lowest-ranking player on the European team, Verburn Olsen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's first-classed actor, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Pulter from England, which could be the last time he plays the Ryder Cup.
With a bag of eight participants at the Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergei Yu Garcia became a European actor with the highest number of winners in the tournaments with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't hold back.
It's been a rough year.
So I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the Cup back.
This is the team, and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia enthusiastically after the European victory.
He's handing over his country's white tortoise John Ram, who defeated the American legend of tigerwoods 2 and 1 at the only game on day one.
"The great pride I feel to defeat Tiger Woods, where I watched as I grew up," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France, and his wife is now standing at 13-21-3, when she's at the top of the Ryder Cup in her career.
It's about strange statistical data from one of the best players at all times, which has won 14 important headlines, when Jack Niklaus alone is in front of him.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find its way through the woods, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Pino, who played high-level golf all over the tournament.
The captain of the U.S. team Jim Fiorrick spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Well done to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna reorganize, I'm gonna work with the American Professional Gulf and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as captain.
We need to take the hat off.
"We've been defeated."
Update on Red Waves: Concentrations fall in Pinalas, Manati and Sersotta
The latest report from Florida's Wild Life and Fish Committee presents a general decline in the red tide concentration in part of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC committee, more widespread rash conditions have been reported in the provinces of Pinalas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - which suggests lower concentrations.
The red tide blossoms over 130 miles from the shoreline, from the north of Pinalas to the southern Lei district.
The portions can be found about 10 miles across the coast of Hilsboro County, but in a few smaller locations compared to last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pascoe County.
Medium-term concentrations on the coast or in front of the coast of the province of Pinalas were reported last week, low-to-middle concentrations in front of the shoreline of the district of Hilsboro, high-ground to high concentrations in the district of Manati, high-back to high-level concentrations in the coastal line or in front of the coast of the province of Sersotá, low-ground to medium-term concentrations in the province of Charlotte, high-ground to high-level concentrations in or across the coast of the district of Lei, and low-level concentrations in the province of Collier.
There's continued reports of increases in the respiratory system from Pinalas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier Countys.
There's been no reports of an increase in the respiratory system in north-west Florida during the last week.
