AMs from Wales are afraid to "be seen as stupid"
There is a continuance among some AMs following a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was raised by plans to change the name of the Welsh Parliament Assembly.
The AMs around the political spectrum are concerned that this will make them look red tape .
AM Labourist said that his group was concerned that "it has the same sound as Twp and Pwp."
For readers from outside Wales: In the language of Wales twp means belle and pwp means a beat.
AM of Plaid said that the whole group was “not happy and suggested alternatives.
Conservative by Wales said that his group had an "open mind" on name changes, but noted that there was a small verbal difference from MWP to "Muppet".
In this event the letter and in the Walles language is pronounced in a similar way to the letter and.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce changes to the name, said: "The final decision on any description of what should be called the members of the Assembly will naturally be a question of the members themselves."
The Welsh Government act of 2017 empowered the Welsh assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which had broad support for the assembly to be called the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the AMs title, the Commission has favoured Members of the Wales Parliament or WMPs, but MWP has received the most support in a public consultation.
It appears that AMs are suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching consensus could be a headache for the Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include further changes in the way the assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on the question of how to call when they have a debate on legislation.
In Macedonia leave public opinion at a referendum on changes in the name of the country
Votes will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia."
The popular vote was set up with a view to finding a solution to a decades-long dispute with the neighbouring country Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents .
The President of Macedonia George Ivanov, opposition of the plebiscite on change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
But referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the consequence of EU and NATO entry.
St. Martin's Shoes Stop Playing as Churches in Harlem are sending
"The elders I spoke with historically say there was a bar and church in every corner," said Mr Adams.
"Today, there's no."
He said he could understand how the bars disappeared.
He said, "People socialise differently" today.
"Bars are no longer the centre of local activity where people go on a regular basis."
As regards churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders are thinking, "and today or tomorrow they will end where they were at first."
It added that churches can be replaced by apartment blocks with condoms filled with the kind of people who will not help the rest of the sanctuaries of the community.
"The great majority of people who buy condoms in this building will be a white carnage," he said, "and thus, they will not be sad when it comes to the day of their opening up to these churches because most of these people who enter these colonies will not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by congregations of white carnage people before Harlem became white carnage people's modules - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's ten years later.
The original Metropolitan Congregation of white carnage people left in the 1930s.
A congregation of black carnage people who were practicing religion in the vicinity took the title to the building.
St Martin's was taken by a congregation of black carnage people under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a bookshop of retailers in 125 Street, a main road to purchase in Harlem, who resisted the rental or promotion of black carnage people.
Fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but as the parishes of Father Johnson made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson's and successor of St Martin's, was proud when he called the Carlon "the bells of the people."
The expert who played the carillon in July called him another one: "Cultural treasure" and "single historical instrument."
The expert, Tifany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that she was the first carilon in the world to have had a musician of black carnage, Dionyo A. Lind, who went to the larger carillon in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather said that St Martin's did not change with anyone else.
What happened in St. Martin's over the last few months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some introduced by the leaders of the lay church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The "vestry" - the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "will seek to pass on the costs" to the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in connecting the architects and contractors who sent him from the diocese.
Some of the nuns complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark hurts a 13-year-old boy during a lobster brush in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was preparing for the lobster in California on the day of the opening of the orange season, said the officials.
The attack took place shortly before the 7th morning where Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was working with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then went with a group to help draw him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the excitement after he caught a bell, but then "he realized that he was shouting, 'Get off me!
Get the fuck out of me!"
He cut and opened the whole club," Hamel said that he realized the moment he arrived where the boy was.
"Feed to get everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
They took the child through a helicopter up to Radio Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack has not been known.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said at a meeting with the media that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic wounds in the upper part of the thorso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Cassald to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
The United Kingdom’s beauty market is the main market for Sainburi’s plans.
Sainsbory's is competing against Boots, Superdrog and Debenhams with corridors of comparable to those of a ‘department site’ of beauty products equipped with specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial market share of the UK’s €2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while the sales of clothing and articles for domestic use decline, larger corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 shops across the country and the idea will spread to more shops next year if it is successful.
The investment in beauty came after the supermarkets were looking for ways to use space on the edge once used for TVs, microwaves and articles for domestic use.
Sansbory's said that it would double the amount of beauty goods it is offering up to 3000 items, including firms such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing product ranges from L'Oral, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have more space with firm areas similar to those in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch the range of its Botique make most of the products fit for vegans – something that is increasingly required of smaller buyers.
In addition, the retailer of the Fragrance Shop perfume will examine concessions in two Sansbory's shops, which first opened in Croydon, London, last week, while the second opened in Sely Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards purchases with small amounts of food per day in local convenience shops means that supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to buy from there.
Mike Coupe, executive head of Sansbory's, said that shops will increasingly look like ‘departmentstores’ as the supermarket chain tries to fight against shops that discount Aldi and Lidl prices with more services and non-food products.
In addition, Argos's business has been on the market since it bought both chains two years ago, which says that it has strengthened the sales of the goods and made more profitable purchases.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments has not been successful.
Sansbory's joint venture with Boots was tested in the early 2000s, but the link ended after a fight on how to share the revenues from the pharmacist's shops in its supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbory's sold the library business with 281 shops to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, to ↑ 125 million, three years ago.
Loyds would play a role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury skin care firms including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business director of Sansbory's, said: "We have transformed the image and sense of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
The range of our firms has been designed to be appropriate for every need and the attractive environment and convenient shopping positions mean that we have become a destination of beauty products of interest that challenge the old purchasing mode."
Peter Jones 'very linked' after Holly Willoughby cancels an agreement of 11 million
The personality of Dragons Den Peter Jones 'very angry' after the television presenter TV Holly Willoughby cancelled an agreement of 11 million with his lifestyle firm's business to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for the brand of household products and their accessories, Truly.
In addition, the Commission considers that the aid granted to Gwynetth Paltrow is compatible with the internal market.
The presenter of Theis Morning, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby left a personality of dragons" Den Peter Jones very angry because it was cancelled from being part of their business of a expensive life-style firm in the last minute - to focus on its big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was "very angry" when the very popular television person admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his enromo business headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, whose new agreements – worth up to €1.5 million – have fixed that they have not had enough time to dedicate it to their firm of household products and accessories, Truly.
The business was compared to the company of Gwynth Paltrow Goop and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of 11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly, Jones left Great Britain and went to one of his private pilgrims.
Source said: "Truly was by far Holly's first priority.
It would have been its long future which would have filled it with the next few decades.
Its decision to leave has left everyone completely surprised.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch almost came.
There is a full store produced at the headquarters of Marlowe which are ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of Theis Morning, located among the profit-making personalities of Great Britain, can mean a cost of millions for the company due to large investment in products from straws and candles to clothing and household products, and the potential for further delay until its launch.
And it can mean an end to a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her village This Baldwin has been well friends with Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman Chairman in March.
Couples go together and Jones has a 40 per cent share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby shall become an ambulatory of the firm of M&S and shall replace Ant McParlin as the representative of I'm A Celibry of ITV.
Yesterday evening, a source near Jones said: "We do not comment on his economic affairs."
Hard meeting 'but then we found love'
He complained about the criticism he would draw from the news media for making a comment that some people consider "not presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said with a voice to imitate that of a "news presenter".
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump announced that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But they stopped denuclearisation negotiations.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's best diplomat, Ri Young Ho, told world leaders, on Saturday, at the General Assembly, that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to the early steps of North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, it noted that the US is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech of demonstration.
He said, "We're walking well with North Korea".
"We were going to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have this very good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results – the end of rocket tests, aid for emergency relief and the return of the remaining US veterinarians.
And he defended his unusual approach while talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside who's trying to enter this stage filled with people, we had about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing at the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunamis and Earthquakes in Indonesia Destroy Island, Kill Hundreds of People
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not required.
Even after more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had to move from their home, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalysing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it was very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, thus challenging," said Ms. Sombung.
While Save the Children is organising a team to travel to Palu, it is not clear whether foreign staff can operate on the spot.
Mr. Sotopo, speaker of the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Given the frequent earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still not well prepared for the great anger of nature.
While sheltering from the tsunamis was built in Aceh, you do not see them very far across the coast.
The apparent lack of warning siren of tsunamis in Palu, despite having issued a warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best times, travel between the numerous islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship was posted in Lombok to care for the victims on its way to Palu, but it will last at least three days to arrive at the location of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improvements to Indonesia's falling infrastructure, the centre of his electoral campaign, and spent a lot of money on roads and trains.
But Mr. Yoko's administration was sent because of a lack of funds as he faced his re-election next year.
Mr Yoko is also facing pressure from still-settling tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of this faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to move from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the street, using ‘machetes’, bows and arrows and other types of weapons.

The Romewell Parliament's image becomes the last monument affected by the argument on the ‘rewriting of history’.
Its removal would be an appropriate form of justice for the destruction similar to that of the Taliban, of many of the British religious and cultural artefacts carried out by its fanatic “Puritan” followers.
But the Cromwell Society has described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "wrong" and "encouraged to rewrite history."
John Goldsmeth, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on removing the status figure that Oliver Cromwell would become a target outside the Westminster Palace.
The ‘icoclasm’ of the English civil war was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the bad Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his antenat Thomas in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of a 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmeth said to the Sunday Telegraf: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of the parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-term conflict of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure that is recognised as representing one side of that divide.
Its achievements as 'Lord Protected' also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
Snake Killer Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in south-eastern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a cut-off, blood-covered floor near the market of Lipanshui in Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post.
Pig growers prepare to inject vaccines in pigs into ‘hoggery’ on 30 May 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
He allegedly travelled with his cousin from nearby province of Junean Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found dead, and discovered a door to the pig herd in the open vicinity.
He said that there was a pig with blood in his mouth inside the groin.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had attacked and killed the farmer, according to the report.
"Cousin legs were bloody and dead," said the cousin, who referred to him with his surname "Wu," as quoted by the Guyang Evening News.
Safety camera videos showed Yuan entering the market on 4.40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about one hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was not of Yuan or of his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to not attack anyone else, while the police collected evidence on the ground.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking people have been registered earlier.
in 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man ended up critically injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg kept a farmer from Wales with his tractor until the animal expelled its wife.
After the pigs of a farmer from Orgon attacked and fed him in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba Farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but the blood taste can act as a "cause".
"They're playing.
They repent, they are very curious... they do not intend to hurt you.
Only you want to show them the appropriate amount of respect," he said.
Uragan Rosa’s remains will bring widespread rainfall in the South-East of the United States
As predicted, Uragan Rosa is weakening as it moves on the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding rains around North and South-East Mexico in the coming days.
Rosa brought a wind of 85 mph, Uragan Category 1, at 5 a.m. on the east of Sunday, and was located 385 miles in the south-west direction of Pointa Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is forming a "trough" on the Pacific Ocean and is moving east to the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm she will start pushing a strong tropical moisture in a north-west direction to the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching ‘trough’ creates a severe south-east rainfall in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous rapid flooding, residual flows and possible valangities in the desert.
A strong tropical humidity will cause rain rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in parts, especially in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
From 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the south-west, especially on a large part of the Arizona.
The rapid flooding is possible under rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread character of the tropical rain.
It would not be a good idea to walk through the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
A heavy rain can cause ‘canyons’ to become dangerous rivers and storms will bring local smells and dust.
The ‘trough’ will bring some rain to parts of the southern coast of California.
They are possible total rain of more than half an inch, which can cause small spillage flows and stowaways.
This would be the first rain of their rainy region.
Some tropical rains spread begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more spilled later on Monday and Tuesday.
A strong rain spreads in Fortcorns on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October there may be some severe temperature change across the US as the Arctic cools, but tropical areas remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There will be a major example of dramatic temperature differences from the US Centre on Sunday.
There is almost a temperature difference of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missori, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to develop and re-expanse.
A large part of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a hot start in October with temperatures in the 80s spread from the Southern Plans to parts of the North-East.
New York City can rise to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is approximately 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate high possibilities for temperatures above the US average during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people have seen the very interesting testimony of Thursday of the nominated candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaough and the woman who accused him of committing a sexual attack that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political struggle continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming with shocking news of the last minute of Friday: an agreement drawn up by the Mayor of Arizona Jeff Flick for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that it is a certain 100 per cent that Kavanaough based it when he was under the influence of alcohol and tried to remove it when they were a post-secondary school festival.
Kavanaough, in evidence of passion, said that it is 100 per cent sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday saw it.
The company was counting the average amount of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks which showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually finds it difficult to calculate how many viewers from offices.
To put it in perspective, it's a similar audience size to that for the decisive football game or for the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinions strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaough, was at the forefront of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, said Nielsen.
ABC was immediately followed by 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaough, those who protested against CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning and were crying with him as he tried to get up in the lift for a hearing of the Judicial Committee were caught.
He remained standing there with his eyes constantly looking down for several minutes as he was being aggressively criticized, in a live broadcast on CNN.
"You're standing here before me," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to a country?
They said to him, "You have power when many women have nothing."
Flick said that his office issued a statement and said, before we closed the doors of the lift, that he would have more to say in the committee's hearing.
All cable and broadcasting networks were broadcasting directly, hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance the Kavanawgh nomination for the Senate in full for a vote.
But Flick said that he would do so only with the understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the person nominated in the following week, that the democratic minorities have been encouraging.
Flick was partly convinced of conversations with his friend, the Democratic Mayor Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Cons and several senators later, Flick took his decision.
Flick's decision was empowered, as it was evident that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaough.
English Prime Minister May accuses critics who are "taking advantage of politics" on Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union to "take advantage" of politics and undermine national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain Teresa May arrived at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview following her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson pressed his attack on the so-called 'Chequers' Plan for Brexit, and said that a proposal that the Great Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "fully condemned."
Shooting on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dayton Simpson after the death of LSU player
The police arrested a suspected gunman who killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyneon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, said Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials issued a confrontation video between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the field and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reporting the CBS affiliate, WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that they admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bond was set at $350,000, reporting Advocate.
The Parish senator's office of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report on Friday, which said that the cause of death is damage from a gun from the head to the neck.
The department is lending credit to the police task force of Luisiana State Police, the state police crime laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area to assist in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Joe Alleva's athletic director thanked the enforcement of the law of the area for the "diligence and search for justice."
Sixs were 20 years old.
The attacker who was 2 meters long, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
It had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 'rebounds' per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU Will Wade basketball coach said that the team is "lost" and "under shock" after the death of Wayde.
"This is what concerns him all the time," said Wade.
Volkan throws ash on Mexico City
Ash being disposed of from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the carrier increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring several sounds and tectonic movements.
Social media images showed thin ash layers covering car windscreens in the vicinity of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geography physicists noted an increase in volcanic activity located 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake in the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The known volcano "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police will have a conflict with separated from Catalonia before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrations in favour of independence had a conflict with the anti-rebel police, and as thousands joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalonia polarisation vote on the coup.
A group in favour of face-to-face separatedists who were held back by the anti-surgery police cast eggs and powder paints at them, creating a dark dust cloud on the streets generally filled with tourists.
There were also small fights during the day and the police had to use the leprosy to control the fighting.
Over a period of several hours, independence groups were helping "not to forget, not to apologize" to fight against union demonstrators who were shouting, "Spain forever."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in the protests, reported in the local picture.
Consensions remained high in the region that wants independence one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by Madrid but which is celebrated by members of Catalonia.
The voters chose with great distance to become independent, although participation was low with the anti-sealers who made a big counter-vote box.
According to the Catalonia authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting at voting stations throughout the region in violent fighting.
Independence groups had camped all night on Friday to prevent demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was carried out but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the stand-by protester with his wife said that they had no hope in the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my mother and father crying with joy that they could vote but now we are alone," he said.
Despite having had a vital and narrow victory in the regional elections last December, the parties in favour of the independence of Catalonia are sending to keep the momentum this year with many of their best known leaders or in the exile they have decided themselves or in detention and are awaiting the process because of their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was registering the protest on his phone in support of the police, said that the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
"There's been more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of Catalonia who is in prison before the process since the end of last year, announced that it would contest the elections of the European Parliament next year.
"As I go out as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the repression of democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car entered a strong house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39 years, were arrested after a car entered a house in London.
The incident occurred at Ballyngard Crecent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Investigative Inspector Bob Blemings said that the injury was caused to the grades and to the buildings themselves.
Crossbow could also be used to shoot at a moment.
Menga's Goal wins game 1-0 for Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston won the game
Livingston, which has been promoted, has made Ringers and thus Steven Gerard lost for the second time only in 18 games as a coach of Ibrox's 'club'.
The shooting of Dolly Menga's ball made the whole difference as Gary Holt's side was equal in points with Hebernian in the second place.
Gerard's side remained unconquered once out of its grand in the Premiership this season and the following Sunday will play against Hearts, which first placed and followed by eight points.
Before that game, Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna in their grand in Europa League on Thursday.
While Livingston continues not to have a loss in the division in six games, with the main coach Holt that hasn't lost a game since it came instead of Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston miss opportunities against large visitors
Holt's team had long been winning before it had 'goal', with its direct style of games which was causing many problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but divided the ball in front of the blast, then Alan Lithgow could only distribute the ball with a wide body after he slipped to get the ball from Craig Halkett near the blast.
Those who were playing in their own grand were happy to let Rangers play before them, because they knew that they had been able to give visitors the problems at certain times.
And that was the way in which the crucial 'goal' arrived.
Rangers allowed 'free-kick' to enter and Livingston took the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to help Menga, who touched the ball and entered the rod from the center of the box.
Until that moment, Rangers were controlling the possession of the ball, but they were finding the defence of the team that were playing in their own grand, non-pent, and the 'goalkeper' Liam Kelly did not have much quiet,
That style of games continued even in the second half of the game, but Alfredo Morelos made Kelly welcome the ball.
Scott Pittman was unable to find a 'goal' because of the 'goalkeper' of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow shot the ball broadly after they shared another player of Livingston.
Balls were constantly entered the Livingston box and were always removed from their players, while two requests for ‘penalty’ - following the attempt by Halket on the Glenn Middleton replacement, and another after the ball was touched by the player's hands - were rejected.
Livingston fenomenal - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland within the Arena Tony Macaroni
Performance and femenal result for Livingston.
For a man, they were excellent, they continued to exceed expectations on this straight up.
The game style and their staff have not changed much from returning to the main fight, but the most credit should go to Holt for the way he has united the team since he arrived.
He had a lot of hero.
The Head of Halkett was very large in his games, by organising a very well organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe World with seven eyes.
However, Rangers had a lack of inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at certain moments under Gerard, there was a lack of standards at this time.
Their last chance with the ball was not good - once they only managed to separate the defence of the team that was playing in his own grand-and-a-mark for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the class.
Erdogan received different reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) people laughed and heard blue as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany – with the aim of repairing relations between NATO allies.
They did not agree on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then left to Cologne to open a huge new Moscow.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The Police cited security reasons to block a large crowd of 25,000 people from being gathered in front of the Moscow, but many people who supported him came up close to seeing their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators against Erdogan - many of them Kurdi - also mentioned their voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome them to the country.
The protests against each other reflect the separation of a visitor who is a hero for certain German Turks and believed to be an autocrat from others.
Road crash in Deptford: Ciklist died in a car collision
Cicilist died in a crash involving a car in London.
The collision took place close to the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a trafficway in Deptford, south-east of the city, at 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and attended the paramedics, but the man died on the spot.
This shock occurred a few months after another cyclist died after he hit a car and continued to walk in Childers Street, about a mile from last Saturday's hit.
The Metropolitan Police said that officials were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and bus deviations are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officials are thrown into disorder
Six prison officers were injured following a disturbance in a high security men's prison, said by the Prison Office.
The disorder started at HMP Long Lartin at Workstershire at 9:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
Specialised officials "Tornado" were introduced to address the disorder, involving eight prisoners and located in one of the sections.
Officials were treated for minor injuries to their face on the ground.
Prison Service spokesman said: " Specially trained prison staff has been deployed to address an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of those who committed the most dangerous crimes in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received hospital care after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October's anti-insurgency officials were called to prison to address a serious disorder in which staff members were attacked by pool balls.
Uragan Rosa Threatenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with Quick Floods (Draining Areas may benefit)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week as the remaining energy of Uragan Rossa moves from the south-west of the desert, leading to rapid flood risks.
The National Temp Service has already established a rapid flood watch for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line from Phenix on Tuesday, and approaching late Monday with the rain.
The National Temp Phoenix Service noted in a tweet that "only ten tropical cycles have maintained tropical storm or depression status at a distance of 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950"!
Catrina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of 40 miles from the AZ border."
The latest models of the National Centre for Uragans predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with amounts isolated up to 6 inches in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other Western Desert areas including central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to have between 1 and 2 inches, with possible totals of 4 to 4 inches.
For those at risk of rapid flooding, the Rosa rain can be positive as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rain is likely to be beneficial as the south-west is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the drought monitoring device, just over 40 per cent of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category," reported byweather.com.
First, the route of Uragan Rosa was led to the next peninsula of Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, who will still be a very strong hurricane on Sunday morning with peak winds of 85 miles per hour, will be located 385 miles south of Point Eugenia, Mexico and will move north with 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting colder waters in the Pacific and thus loses power.
Thus, it is expected to touch Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or early evening.
Rain in parts of Mexico can be severe, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baya California to the north-west of Sonora, with a possibility of not more than 10 inches," reported by Weather.com.
Rosa will then move north around Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move from Arizona and south of Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The main hazard expected from Rosa or its remains is a very severe rain in Baja California, in the north-west of Sonora, and in the western United States desert," they said from the National Centre of Uragans.
This rain is expected to produce life-threatening rapid floods and flood streams in the deserts, and valangi in mountain terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested after attempted murder
Three adolescents and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old adolescent was found with knife wounds in Sumerset.
The adolescent child was found injured in Excelsior Terrace in the Midsomer Norton area, for a hit of 04:00 BST on Saturday.
Take him to the hospital where he remains in "stabilised" condition.
17-year-old adolescents, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon, said Sommerset Police.
Officials called on anyone who could have a video drawn from the phone of what happened to speak.
Trump said that Kavanaough ‘sent the green and anger’ of the Democratic Party
"Vot for Judge Kavanaough is a vote to reject the heartless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump during a demonstration in Welling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaough ‘sent the green and anger’ of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaough witnessed before Congress on Thursday, with strength and emotion he denied a claim by Christine Blasy Ford that he had sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed during the hearing about its allegation.
On Saturday, the president said that, at that time, the "American people saw Kavanaugh's "bravour and quality and courage".
"A vote confirming Judge Kavanaough is a vote confirming one of the most modern legal minds, a jurist with an ineligible public service record", he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President referred indirectly to the designation of Kavanaough speaking of the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
Who don't dispute, but actually, I'm arguing," he said.
"I am therefore running everywhere to fight for very good candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats have a mission to "resist and hinder."
The first major procedural vote within the Senate on the designation of Kavanaough is expected to take place no later than Friday, said a senior assistant of the management of the GOP to CNN.
Hundreds were killed by the Indonesian earthquake, by the tsunami, with the apparent increase in deaths.
At least 384 people were killed, many were carried as huge waves fell on beaches, after a great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when a wave of up to six feet (18 feet) fell on the ground when it started to dark, while many carried and died and destroyed everything in the middle.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5-power earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not rise up to happen immediately and ended up victims," said Sutopo Puro Nugroho, the speaker for the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency BNPB during a breefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not appear alone, pulled cars, logs, houses, hit everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had travelled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before it hit the shore.
Some people went up the trees to escape from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evicted to 24 centres in Palu.
Air photos issued by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, self-scattering bridges and falling and water-circuited Moscow.
Strong shocks continued to threaten the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated in the statement that energy released from the huge earthquake of Week was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
They said that the city's geography, located at the edge of a long narrow beach, could have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, business centres and hotels had fallen.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the collapse of a building that fell, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) to the north of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the centre of the earthquake.
Communications "were completely sent without information" by Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was highly criticized because it did not know that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said that the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In a video of the social media-shared amateurs, a man on the top floor of a building may be heard shouting anxiety warnings for the tsunami that was approaching people on the lower road.
In a few minutes an enormous amount of water came down strong on the shore, and carried with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not authenticate the films immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a strong cut-off of light that reduced communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The authorities claimed that the military had started sending cargo aircraft with the assistance of Jakart and other cities, but the evacuations still need food and other basic needs.
The airport has been reopened only for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths well exceeds 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While the World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived strong and complete in the city of Palu, where the sheltering employees were shillings of the guned tarpolin in the courtyard of their office, they moved from the scene of a raid on their way there, said Mr. Dosbea.
He said, "They said they saw many houses destroyed."
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups started the unpleasant disaster aid process, some complained about the fact that foreign aid workers with deep competences were not allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and staff from abroad can only start if the disaster site is declared as a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
"There is still a disaster of province level," said Aulia Ariani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Since the government says, "O.C., this is a national disaster," we can introduce international assistance but so far there is no status."
On the second night in Pallu after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, the friends and family of the missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that will depict this history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy came out of a sewage.
On Sunday, people carrying out a rescue rescued a woman who was trapped under the breakup for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesian national team coach of Paragliding, had trained two missing paragliders for Asian Games, who ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other than those captured in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
"As a top person in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional weight," he said.
Mr Gendon told how, in the hours after the news of the fall of the Hotel Roa Roa circulated among the paragliding community, he sent messages with WhatsApp to Palu's competitors, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, only marked that they left, but did not mark that they had arrived.
"I think what means that the messages didn't come," he said.
Khalelin takes $26,750 while ATM was being refilled in Newport on the Livee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Bink's worker who was re-filling ATM in Newport on the Leve, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "was going to happen after the Bink's employee" and stole a money bag intended for delivery.
According to the statement, the witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities shall contact the New York Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rap canister changes his name to Ye
The Canye West rapcant is changing his name – for Ye.
Announcing the change in Twitter on Saturday, he said: "The man previously known as Kanye West"
West, 41, was vaccinated Ye for some time and used the monitor as the title for his eight album, which was issued in June.
The change takes place before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to launch its new album Yandhi.
It replaces the Ariana Grande on the programme which was cancelled for "emotional reasons," said the programme creator.
In addition to clarifying his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible means "you," said West earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with the broadcaster Big Boy.
"Alura I, you, I we, she, we.
From Kanye which means ‘the only one’, for Ye only – just a reflection of what we have is good, bad, what disturbs us, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
It is one of a number of famous rap singers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but the year announced to prefer the names Love and Brothers Love.
As a collaborator with West, JAY-Z, it is also served with or without a single and capital letters.
AML Mexico promises not to use the military against civilians
The President-elect of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use a military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Taltelolco Place which "will never use the military to restrict the Mexican people."
The troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when left student movements were being established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those who study and open more public universities free of charge.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
The United States should double the funds for I.A.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this field, says the IA Kai-Fu Lee investor and practitioner, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after several parts of the US government made IA notices, even if there is a lack of a formal IA strategy in the US.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be the first in IA innovation by 2030.
"Dualising the IA research budget would be a good start, since all other countries are far behind the US, and we are looking for the next revolutional step in the IA," said Lee.
The doubling of funds could double the possibilities for the major acquisition of the next IA to take place in the United States, Lee told CNBC at an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent IA companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that won the highest-ranking American Otello player, and later was executive with Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch in China.
Lee recognised previous US government competitions in technology such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defence Research Project Agency and asked when it would be next, in order to help identify the next interviews.
Lee said that researchers in the United States often have to work hard to take government grants.
Noe said, "It is not China that is removing academic leaders; the corporations are doing so,"
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have employed people who inspire others from universities to work on the IA.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the US to strengthen their efforts in the IA.
He said, "I believe that the green paper should be offered automatically to people who have a Doctorate in the IA".
The China State Council issued the Next Generation Artistic Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funds to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organisations spend money on US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artistic Intelligence, which is intended to involve industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Selected Committee for Artistic Intelligence.
And DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As regards the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in IA research.
Meanwhile, US legislation which has tried to create a National Artistic Intelligence Commission has not seen any action in several months.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia," a step that resolves a long-standing dispute with Greece that had blocked its membership offers for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of the neighbor in its north represents a possibility of owning its territory and has taken over its entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the population of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and a boxing campaign raised doubts as to whether participation would reach the minimum of 50 per cent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote is read: "You favour membership in NATO and in the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Those supporting the change in name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to enter into bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgejevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, sufficient members of the parliament said they would respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change in name requires a two-thirds majority in the parliament.
The State electoral commission stated that there had been no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I've come to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Goose Tanevski, 62, voting in capital, Skopje.
The PM of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country giving him the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, he was arming a small stage and preparing seats in front of the tents armed by those who would make a referendum box.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to enter proudly under our conditions, not by ordering others" said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that membership in NATO will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the great majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after he voted.
He said that a result in favour of the change of name would be "affirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute said that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters will participate in the referendum - an amount below that required participation.
Another survey, carried out by Macedonian TV, found that 57 percent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, participation should be 50 per cent and one more vote.
If the referendum fails, it represents the first serious blow to government policy in favour of Western ideologies from the moment it took control in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, passes all Brighton's defence to ‘goal’
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defence at the 2-0-winning of Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his 'goal' in 65 minutes seemed very easy.
The attacker from Argentina received a ball from half the ground at the beginning of the sequence.
He was one of three of Brighton's defenders before he ran into open space.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green flak players.
Fight with one defencer before fleeing from much more to the edge of the Brighton box.
Then split the ball on his left and found Sterling.
The English attacker touched the ball for the first time in the box to redistribute Aguero, who used the right foot to insert the ball on the right side of the net by passing it from where the Goalkeeper of the Brighton Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero is sending some problems to his feet," said the coach of City Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about the fact that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We had the good luck of doing 'goal' at that moment."
But it was Sterling that gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the fight of the President League.
That 'goal' took place in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball very much in the territory of Brighton in that action.
Send the ball right to Leroy Sane on the left side in a very nice way.
Sane touched the ball some time before it led to Sterling where the blast.
The attacker of the Sky Blues touched the ball slightly and entered the net just before landing into a territory he was not supposed to enter.
City will play against Hoffenheim at the level of the Champists League at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Nekkar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer must play in Spoiler vs. Rockies
As nationals were eliminated from the possibility to compete in the decisive game, there was no reason to make an effort to start again.
But the player so competitive Scherzer hopes to be the 'pitcher' on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that the Rockies have the possibility to play in the decisive game, which are in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West with one game.
The Rockies have managed to achieve a possibility to continue to compete with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals Friday evening, but are still seeking the first title of the division.
"Although we are playing for nothing, we can at least have the possibility of winning by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver is with the crowd and the other team is likely to be playing at the highest level of any point I can face this year.
What would you not want to compete in those circumstances?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but they are allegedly inclined to allow Scherzer to be the 'pitcher' in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting for the 34th time, has had a practice session on Thursday and will be playing as a pitcher on Sundays when he is generally resting.
The player from Washington who plays with his right hand is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 ‘strikeouts’ in 220 2/3 ‘inings’ this season.
Rump manifestations in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation concerning the selection for his Supreme Court, Bert Kavanaough, speaking of the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"In November, everything we have done will be threatened.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is very great -- I don't contest, but I'm actually arguing, so I'm running everywhere to fight for very good candidates," he said.
"We see this very terrible and radical group of Democratics, we see it happening now," Trump continued.
And they are determined to take back power using any means possible, you can see green.
They don't care about those who hurt, those who want to fly to get power and control, what they want, power and control, we won't give them."
He said that Democratics have a mission to "resist and hinder."
"And I've seen it over the last four days," he said, and he was calling the Democratics "wrong and green and disturbing and dishonest."
He referred to the Democratic Senator classified in the Justice Committee of the Senate Diane Feinstein on her behalf, and received many negative cries from the audience.
"Do you remember her reply?
Have you issued the document?
Uh, uh, what is it.
No, no, I expect, first of all - the movements of her body were not positive at all - the worst movements I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad group.
It does not tolerate the communication of its opinions.
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to encamp me, I did not take it very much.
After all, I am the most recent MP in a list of MPs of the Labour Party that was not positively welcomed – because we communicated our views.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she fought against anti-Semiticism.
In my case, the motion of imprisonment criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, issues similar to those for which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Council of Friday evenings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more compassionate and gentle" policy that has been forgotten if, in fact, it has ever started in the truth.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged whether it is acceptable for the conduct of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I thought I had a similar political view began to expect me to change my understanding and take positions I never agreed with in other situations – both on national security and on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and, in fact, do not make a difference – I am followed by abuse of social media with a request to remove me from my post as MP, condemn the centre's policy, and tell me that it is not part of the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Yes, I know I had better luck than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who daily face a lot of sexual or racist abuse but are never hidden from comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the fact that the levels of abuse have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad group and with every move of "insecure" or a change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
I have been given much advice over the last two years that encouraged me to hold my opinions for me, not to be so vocal and then everything "be well."
But I did not get involved in politics to do so.
Since my entry into the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government that has left my comprehensive school class literally in a state of disaster, I have sought to improve public services for those who need them most – both as a local councillor and as a government minister.
I never hid my policy, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I say is that when the country is moving to Brexit that will harm our families, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to work for you and I promise you that no amount of threats that depose me from my post or political fervor does discourage me from acting in those I believe are your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, not yet lost, ascends to the top of the classification
Two attempts could have changed slightly the outcome, but there was no doubt that Ayr was right to win this exciting day's game of Tenent's Premiership.
At present they are first in the classification, the only team out of all ten who have not lost once.
Finally, it was the top defence, as well as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities, that helped the team, who was playing in his own grand, win, and the Peter Murchie coach had every right to be happy.
"We've gained from trials during our games so far, and we haven't lost one yet, so I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Give credit to Ayr, they have taken advantage of opportunities better than us."
With the attempt of Grant Anderson's in 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Climo, Ayr were winning, but, a yellow card from the head of Scotland Roy Hughes, which was allowed to play the game by the Wariors, gave Melrose the opportunity to try and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's victory with 'pullity', before, in the middle of the exact game, made 'goal' and converted an individual attempt to 17-5 points to Ayr in the suitcase.
But Melrose started the second part of the game well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted from Baggot, reduced the gap by 5 points.
Then stopped the game because of a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which came out of the ground on a stretcher, and as soon as it started the game again, Ayr continued to take the points after an attempt by Stafford McDowell, converted by Climo.
The head agent of Ayr Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and Melrose again came out of aggression when they made an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, after a period of severe pressure.
However, the team that was playing in his own grand began again to attack, and when he was given a yellow card Stern Hutchinson for the action he had done on Climo without the ball, from the line of the "pullty", MacPherson touched the ball with the ground at the back of the advancing Ayr group.
Climo converted, as he did again almost again from the area from which the game starts again, after he collected the ball that David Armstrong met from the box and sent Gregor Henry, who plays with the side, to the fifth attempt of the side she was playing in her own grand.

'The sea is ours': Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes that the court will reopen a passage for the Pacific
Seafarers guard the naval headquarters armed with ropes and chains in La Paz.
A public building has an ocean-coloured blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered by moto: "The sea is ours right.
Recovery is a duty."
Around Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources of the 19th century remains clear – as soon as Bolivians are able to sail in the Pacific Ocean again.
That hope may be at its highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and sereneness, and of course waits for the result with a positive intention," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ECI's decision on large screens throughout the country, with the hope that the Tribal in The Hague will find, in favour of the Bolivian statement, that – after decades of irregular talk – Chile is obliged to negotiate and give Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's Crimean Indigenous President - facing a controversial battle for his re-election next year - also has much to lose in the Monday's decision.
"We are very close to getting access to the Pacific Ocean again," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court would decide in favour of Bolivia - and that little would change if it did.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant Chilean territory, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the CGI judgment only arrives six months after final arguments have been heard, indicates that the case "was not complicated" said Paz Zárate, an expert from Chile in international law.
And far from favouring Bolivia's cause, the last four years could not have been of any help.
"The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
The hostile rhetoric of Morales weakened any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will, at some point, continue to speak, but it will be very difficult to have discussions thereafter.
Both countries have not shared ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, denied the idea that court decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the "an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular Latin American presidents - was using the maritime issue as political aid.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can trust the United States.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Young Ho says that his nation will never disarm nuclear weapons is first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri had spoken on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to fulfil the promises made at a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
It submits its comments as the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears to have arrived at the resumption of the nuclear diplomacy which is in place more than three months after Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
He says that it is "a hope in the vacuum" that the continued sanctions and the US's objection to a declaration that an end to the Korean War will never force North Korea to give up.
Washington is concerned about whether to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang doing the first significant disarmament steps.
Both Kim and the US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is serious to renounce weapons that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompio is planning to visit Pyongyang in the next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows the latest collection of clothing for the massive head which will soon appear in the main shops.
If you want to add to the collection of your hats or completely cover the sun, you may stop looking.
Valentino and Tom Browne designers revealed a very strange and large range of head clothing for their spring and summer collection of 2019 on the runway that won the set of style in Paris Fashion Week.
Very impracticable hats are very visible on Instagram this summer and these designers have raised their surprising creations on the stage.
The article most impressive by Valentino was an extravagant beige with a wide edge similar to the feathers which completely covered the heads of the models.
Other very large accesses included Jewel-coated dolls, a hat of praise and even anas - but not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Browne also revealed a choice of strange mask - and just in time for Halloween.
Most of the coloured masks had the lips sewn up and were more like Hannibal Lecter than 'haute coture'.
One incident was similar to the snorkele and goggles-completed brawl device, while another was like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue with this good proxy style.
Those who follow the fashion predict that huge 'bonnets' will soon appear in the main shops.
The very large hats come out after the release of 'La Bomba', the large two-legged straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The ‘cult label’ responsible for the hat that is not practical at all that has appeared very much on the social media has raised another major reaction on the stage - a straw bag containing almost as much as the model we were carrying.
The dark orange raffle bag, surrounded by the small raffle twine and a white skin grip, was the most prominent creation in the 2019 spring and summer collection of Jacquemus in Paris Fashion Week.
"I expect to see large hats and sea bags in the main shops for the coming summer - since the designer has made a huge impact, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for very large accessories."
John Edward: Skills in languages essential to global citizens
The independent schools of Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another set of excellent examinations results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), endeavour to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalised school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain the subject of popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If a man speaks in a language he understands, he understands.
If they speak in his own language, he understands it with his own heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examinations, we can see that languages are at the forefront in the classification tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have achieved a higher degree A.
The data, collected from the 74 schools that are members of the SCIS, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish also achieved A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages are now, as a matter of choice, being kept in the same respect as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 UK Employment and Skills Commission survey found that from the reasons employers gave for sending job vacancies to fill, 17 per cent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming more and more imperative to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective employment opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Irrespective of the career of choosing, learning another language, it will have a real advantage in the future because it has the ability to survive such a life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a multilingual person in the lead in competition.
According to a USGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation and, by 15 per cent, French is the only language spoken with a percentage of two numbers.
That is why investment in language learning is now important for today's children.
Learning more than one language, particularly those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will learn different languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages that can be chosen from them in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future.
It cannot currently be denied, in a global business environment, that languages remain very important for the future of the country, and this should therefore be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
The fun building no faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Sunday LeBron will play for the first time with the Lackers in San Diego
The sports supporters of LeBron James no longer had much to expect to start for the first time for Los Angeles Lackers.
The coach of the Lake Walton Lakers announced that James will play in the opening game before the start of the season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the amount of minutes to play remains to be determined.
"We will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of the Lackers.
The journalist of Lakers Mike Trudell wrote a tweet that, probably, James will play a limited amount of minutes.
Following the practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the schedule of the six games before the start of the Lacers season.
"In this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself," he said.
Rump demonstration in West Virginia, Yatube Canal
President Donald Trump starts a wave of demonstrations of the campaign tonight in Weeling, West Virginia.
This is the first demonstration of Trump out of five scheduled next week, including stops in amicable locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a confirmatory vote suspended for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the forthcoming mid-term elections as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when voting in Nov.
At what time is the demonstration of Trump in West Virginia tonight and how do you see it online?
The demonstration of Trump in Weeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET toight, Saturday, 29th September, 2018.
You can see the demonstration of Trump in West Virginia online below through a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for the nomination of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaough, which were intensified by allegations of sexual misconduct by an early confirmation vote of the Senate suspended until one week while investigating the FBI.
But the primary objective of this wave of demonstrations is to help the Republicans face the November elections to get some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that these five demonstrations next week are aimed at "give energy to volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The Control of the Congress is so important for this agenda that the president will travel as soon as possible to states as we approach the season of the committed campaign," he told Reouts speaker for the Trump campaign that he referred to his name.
A timetable for the Arena of Wesbanco in Weeling, tonight's demonstration can bring together fans from "Oyo and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the Pittsburg media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump will have visited West Virginia, the state which won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate of the Republican Senate of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is losing in the survey.
"It's not a good sign for Morisey that the president came to try to boost him in the survey," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Tazza Ryder 2018: United States of America Team determined not to give up while approaching Sunday singles
After three sessions on one side, Saturday afternoon’s Forums could have been exactly what she needed this Ryder Cup.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a fully invented concept of sport but one that players really believe in, and never more than in such competitions.
So where do they say that the momentum is now?
"These were at the front with six points and are now with four, so I think we're carrying this as a little momentum," said Jordan Speth as he left during the day.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, four leading points with another twelve to play.
Americans, says Speth, feel but have a little discomfort and much to encourage them, not least the form of Speth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each of them boast with three points from four.
He was precise from tea to green and is leading by example.
That cry from the heart of a celebration continued to grow as his round continued, making a crucial push to bring the fourth game equal to when he and Thomas were two from below two.
His beat that won the game on 15 was welcomed by a similar shout, the kind that tells you to believe that the American team is still there.
"Vera must go deep and worry about your own item," said Speth.
This is what each of these players missed.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points from Speth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the uncontested history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but sweet couple of Europe are four by four and are considered perfect.
"Moliwood" were the only pair who didn't skiry on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy is moving both towards and from this living crowd establishes that they are the players who are offering the challenge Sunday, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European win as the sun descends on Le Golf National from Fleetwood or Molinari.
Both preferably at once on different holes.
But here we are talking about a European glory for which it is still early.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson quickly finished from Sergio Garcia, the morning football hero, when he was placed in a park with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the front nine brought the Spanish and Swedish into a hole that they have never managed to get close to.
But Sunday, there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Voorballs and Forums are very interesting to see them closely due to peer interactions, advice they give, advice they do not give and the way a strategy can be changed in one second.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is at the forefront of the final day but this forum has also shown that the US Team has the determination that some, especially from the US side, were in doubt.
Europe in the lead with 10-6 on the final day of Cup Ryder
Europe will take good advantage of the final day of the Ryder Cup after it was released from Saturday’s front football and football parties with 10-6 on the US.
The spirit pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made the two-winning effort on Tigger Woods that found it difficult to take their score so far in the L'Golf National for four points.
The European side of Thomas Bojrn, ready to retain the lost trophies in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American side that had gone badly into the morning football series, which took the series with 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the Forums, winning two parties, but could not reach the score difference.
The side of Jim Furyk required eight points from the 12 items of one Sunday player to hold the trophie.
Fleetwood is the first new European for the season to win four successive points while he and Molinari, vaccinated "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are only the second to win four points from their four opening parties in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After they dominated Woods and Patrick Red in the footballs then worked excellently to win Woods that did not appear optimistic and to the new American player for the Bryson Dechambeau season with an even more empathetic score of 5&4.
Woods, who found difficulty in both parties on Saturday, showed occasional moments of brilliantness but now lost 19 out of his 29 items in the football and the foursomes and seven in succession.
Justin Rose, resting for morning footballs, returned to his partner Henrik Stanson at the Forums for a loss of 2&1 of Dustin Johnson and Cooks Koepka - which are first and third in the world.
However, it has not been all that Europe wanted on a beautiful day, with a slight fall in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Speth, a three-fold great winner, and Justin Thomas set the threshold for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They achieved a bold victory of 2&1 over John Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the footballs and later returned to win Poulter and Roy McIllroy with 4&3 in the Forums after losing both opening holes.
It was only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team would return from a four-point difference while it was entering the singles, although Furyk side holders need a routine to keep the trophie.
However, after being the second best for two days, a Sunday attack seems to be more than they can do.
North Korea says that "in no way" will not be unilaterally disarmed without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuing sanctions were deepening its lack of confidence in the United States and that there was no way that the country would leave its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world's body that North Korea had taken "considerably good will measures" last year, as it had established nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site, and promised not to promote nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no way disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri repeated familiar complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearisation in which North Korea would have been rewarded as soon as it took gradual steps, its statement appeared significantly not to have rejected unilateral denuclearisation in the past as Pyongyang had done in the past.
He referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever held between a US president serving his duties and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work towards the "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea was looking for a formal end to the 1950-53 War of Korea, but the United States said that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls to reduce hard international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists on "denuclearisation first" and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their objective in a cogens manner, and even objects to the "end-of-war declaration," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can break us is a dream of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions are deepening our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party to this issue of denuclearisation were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have arrived at such a block."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the United States' continental land with North Korean rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Kacti" Trump called Kim "a man of rockets" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work remained to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearised.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this, saying "If it takes two, three years or five months - it doesn't make a difference."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey, Thursday, told the UN Security Council that "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council should continue vigorously and without stopping until we achieve fully and finally verified denuclearisation."
The Security Council unanimously reinforced the sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with the aim of stopping funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompio met with Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly and later said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompio has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, after in a few hours North Korea criticized for making "gangster-like claims".
In a meeting with Mon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the US takes "corresponding measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard's students conduct a course on taking sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has been able to make all its students who have not yet graduated to sleep more with the aim of fighting the growing macho culture to study all night and remain awake thanks to caffeine.
An academic found that students at the university in the first place in the world often have no idea about the basic true things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after speaking about the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
"Finally she was a girl on me and said, "Why are they saying this to me now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she said to The Telegraf.
The course, which started for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials of how good sleep traditions help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatric at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that the students had serious insomnia during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a student's bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to tell them the effects of caffeine and light and on how athletic performance has an effect on sleep deficiency, and the routine importance of sleep time.
In another section, participants are told how long-term insomnia can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icones, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the students' behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know - as much as you have the right to know the effects on health when choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
A culture that is proud that "you've been able to stay up all night studying" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring that it sleeps sufficiently, and good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of a student to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid increasing weight, as sleeplessness puts the brain in a mode of hunger, which makes them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to insist on a course throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduates to do a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students should consider making an alarm for going to sleep, as well as for getting up, and know about the harmful effects of "blue light" coming out of electronic screens and LED light, which can imbalance your circadian rhythm, and lead to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The Menga goal debuts Gerard men
Ringers suffered another period of distress when they played abroad as Dolly Menga's strike delivered the separate side of Steven Gerard for a loss of 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking for a record of their first victory while they were travelling from the 4-1 Trinafal victory in St Johnston, but the Gary Hold team only caused Gerard's second loss in 18 items as manager to leave his side eight points away from the major leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time and the list of Ringers' missing inspiration never appeared to be reaching it.
While Rangers now go down to the sixth place, Livingston goes up to the third and only after Hebernian on a gooul difference.
And there may be more trouble for Rangers after the lineman Clum Space had to be treated for a head wound after apparently throwing an object on the side of the team that played abroad.
Gerard made eight changes to the past side of Ayr to the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Harts last week and was pleased with the way his well-trained form has constantly hindered their opponents.
Rangers could dominate ownership but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They had to run only two minutes from the start when the first time's play-off of Menga sent Scott Pittman to a gooll of Allan McGregor but the midfelder took his great chance.
Free-kick's strong Keaghan Jacobs then found the craig Halkett specter but his defence partner Alan Lithgow could only flow from behind.
Rangers achieved control but appeared to have more hope than believing about their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have had a penalty on the mark of fifteen minutes as he and Steven Lawlesss stood up but the tenor Steven Thompson ignored the appeals of the Colombian.
Ringers successfully targeted only two shores in the first half of the party but the former goalkeeper of Ibrox Liam Kelly hardly worried about the head stroke of Lassana Coulibaly and the mild strike of Ovie Ejaria.
While the first pull of Livi in 34 minutes could have been when the other team was playing better, no one can deny that they deserved only their effort.
Once again, Rangers were unable to manage a good set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher whispered the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga to finish the action.
Gerard responded to the brake by changing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change almost provided an immediate impact as the whistling in Morellos but the impressive Kelly ran from its line to block.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett who caught a long ball after a long ball.
The Holt side could extend their leading position in the final stages but McGregor kept firmly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow went to the open from the corner.
Ringers Glenn Middleton's successor had another late request for generality as he argued with Jacobs but again Thompson looked the other way.
Almanak: Geiger Continuator inventor
And now a page from our "Sundy Morning" Almanac: 30 September, 1882, like today 136 years today, and WE'RE COMING ... the day on which the future physical Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Consul of Geiger.
A science foundation since then, the Consul of Geiger has also become a foundation of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those unsuspectable coves scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans appear:
Man: "That's some shit she is?"
Rogers: "That Geiger connector, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these spoons, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that give radioactivity in the minerals."

A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells by a patient, which is converted into a laboratory
They can then "see" a common protein for many cancers and then be re-injected.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells by a patient, which change into the laboratory so that they can “see” a common protein for many cancers called HER2, and then re-inject cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stirring the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained the Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the intake of immune cells by patients and how to "learn" how to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West made a Verbal Attack Favor Trump, While he was wearing a Berritta of MAGA, After What He Seed on SNL.
That’s Wrong!
Kanye West was booked in the studio during Saturday Night Live following a confusing performance in which the US President Donald Trump praised him and said that he was going to be elected in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, named Ghost Town, in which he was wearing a free suit of Mace America Great, he started to say against the Democratics and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I talk to a white person and tell me, "How can you please Trump, that racist?"
If you were concerned about racism, I've left America," he said.
SNL initiated the programme with a demonstration of the commission in which Matt Damon appeared in which Hollywood's star repeated the statement by Bert Kavanaough before the Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although he did not broadcast, West video was posted on social media by media writer Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to rub you with West when he put it.
In addition, West had complained with the audience that they had caught with him after the day about his freedom.
"Bulk me behind the corners.
He said, "Don't go out there with that sweet."
They bullied me!
Then they say they're lost," said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You must see the lost? And he continued to say that he would've worn the cap of my superior, because this means that you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments were followed by at least two stamps from the SNL audience and members of the SNL case appeared embarrassed, reported Variety, with one person there who told the publication: "In all the studio a great silence has fallen."
West brought him as a late substitute for the Cantana Grande, which the boyfried that she had, the Mac Miller rapper had died a few days ago.
West has deepened many with the performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perier's bottle.
West had support from the president of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most courageous spirits: GRANTS TO STOP TO THE COLLA."
But the presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply "what it is and this is something beautiful menens."
"But I didn't choose to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who believes that he is embracing and disseminating an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
So much so we," she added.
Before the program, the representative announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that it was now "what was previously known as Kanye West."
It is not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The former rapper, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lyon and of course the music legend that is no longer with us Prince, changed his name to a symbol then the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder on knife shots in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of murder when a man was given knife shots in a restaurant in Belfast Eastern Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackmore, said the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Court of Judges of Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones Kit Harington's star speaks of toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his role in telling the sword as Jon Snow in the series of violent media fantasy of HBO Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old player spoke about the macho hero stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen mean that the young person often feels that they want to be violent to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and had doubts about how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his coast of Game of Therones Rose Leslie, also aged 31, admitted to having "strong interests" to address the issue.
"Personally, I feel that I have a strong interest, right now--where did we go wrong with the masculinity?" said.
"What were we teaching men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we now have?"
It was believed that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through its very male characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes the young people feel that they want to be this certain aspect of a man?
I think this is one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because it's very clear that something went wrong for the juvenulator."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make prequells or sequeles of Game of Therones when the series came to its end the following summer, saying that "so wars and horses".
Since November Kit will appear in the new production of True West of Sam Shepard which is the history of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considered that when he met his wife Rose it was the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this program, so in this way he gave me my future family, and my life from here on," he said.
Rose interprets the part of Ygrite, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the series of fantasy that won in Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in the land of Lesley's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% leap in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, say health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, around 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people taking HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in the province of June.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Gender transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was declared in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is said to be common.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most of the transmissions of diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has disclosed GOP's senators' data, saying "dangerous lies" and "confused theories"
The representative of the United States Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of its staff had posted the personal information of three US Republican mayors on the pages of Wikipedia of legislators.
The Democratt of Los Angeles has ascertained that the claims were spreading from "right-hand-ultra" funds and websites.
"Falses, lies and more lies of those who lie," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information released allegedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers of the United States Mayors Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hotch, both Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a panel hearing of the Senate on allegations of sexual misconduct against the nomination of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure took place some time after the three mayors questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and released the information of a staff member of Waters, reported The Hill.
"This baseless allegation is totally false and absolutely false," continued Waters.
"My staff member – whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – has in no way been responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This baseless allegation is totally false and absolutely false."
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, including from the former press secretary of White House Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is one of anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that he does not have the time to be a Member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he shall not be angry.
It shall not be resistant.
The defendant's motives shall not be called into question.
It shall be calm and quiet."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing the response of Waters with the criticism of the Democracies of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of the criticism that appeared to be too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will come out to take the chair of Waters in the mid-term elections, also mentioned his voice on Twitter.
"This is a great thing if it's true," he said on Twitter.
In its statement, Waters stated that its office had warned "the appropriate law enforcement authorities and entities about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that authors will be discovered," continued, "and that they will be legally held accountable for all their actions which are harmful and dangerous to each and all members of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again — Rowan Atkinson, imitation of an unhealthy spy
It is now traditional to look for meanings of Brexit in any new film with a British perspective and this seems to be applicable to the return of the Johnny English-community franchise of action - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and took up life again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is the issue of how bad we are, an anonymous self-saira, an opportunity for a new export of the country?
At any rate, the incompetitors Johnny English with large eyes and face-to-face parts moving unusually had the licence renewed for the second time to do anything wrong - what his name is more than anything else shows that it is a widespread comity designed for territories of people who go to cinemas that do not speak English.
It is of course the stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims to his sweet past, has some of Clauseau, a hit by Mr. Bean and a large part of that man who contributed one note to the melodies of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony in London.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international husband of a mystery who once had made his part in Barcklaycard TV adverts, today forgotten, after he left Cosmos behind.
There is a beautiful moment or two in this last issue of JE.
I liked the moment when Johnny English was approaching a helicopter while he was wearing a medium-made corrugated clothing and the blades of the propellers caught with his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's gift to the physical comedy appears, but humor is felt rather poor and overextraordinaryly, especially since the "series" film marks such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves offer the comedy as a confident ingredient.
The humor is felt to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me the strange, tragic incidents of Johnny English were not as inventive and as focused as Atkinson's silent film jokes in Bean's person.
The permanent topical proposal now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has filtered the very secret web network of British spies, exposing the identities of all British agents in the field, to the disappointment of the agent on the job - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the cake cake for the prime minister who is an impenetrable and difficult figure, who is already suffering from a complete breakdown of political popularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this character as Teresa May but there is not much in the script to work.
Its intelligence advisors inform her that every active spy has been compromised, someone will have to be withdrawn.
And this means the Incompetitors Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in an elegant building, but gives unofficial lessons on how to become an infiltrated operational: I have a few good laugh here as English offers a School of Rock-type spin-up.
English is taken back to Whitehall for emergency meetings and joined his former long-term partner, Bogh, again translated by Ben Miller.
Bogh is now a married man, with a submarine commander, a role of one who is interpreted by Vicki Pepperdine, in which she is a little wasted.
Therefore, both irreconcilable and always confusing in the Secret Service of its mass, are back in action, when they meet the character of a quiet and beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister falls under the rule of the billion sweet technology that he claims he can solve the problems of the British computer: Mayor Jason Volta, interpreted by Jack Lacy.
English and Bogh start their journey of fun manners in a herd: dresses as waiters, fire to a high French restaurant, create a nightmare to rise on the luxury yacht of Volta; and English start a full anarchy as it tries to use virtual reality bars to familiarize itself with the visitation of Volta's home.
Of course all stops lead to that last sequence, but as amicable and as animate as it is, has little idea of children's television.
Something's pretty moderate.
And like the other Johnny English films I couldn't think of: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that he really deserves for his talent?
The Labour refuse to prepare a plan for the British to work for a week of four days but is paid for five days
The Jeremiah Corbyn Labor Party is expected to consider a radical plan that will see the British work a week of four days – but pay for five.
The party allegedly wants the company teacher to pass on the remainder of the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to the workers by giving them another day of savings.
This would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend – but still take the same pay with them.
Sources said that the idea would be "deprived" with the agenda and economic plans of the party that the country is turning in favour of the workers.
The four-day transition was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way to take advantage of the changing economy.
Senior official of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "I expect a policy review to be announced before the end of the year.
"This will not happen for tomorrow, but a four-day working week is a healthy inspiration with the party's approach to rebalancing the labour-friendly economy as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first to approve such an idea, with the Green Party which promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, the aspiration is currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
Speaker for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
The Archbishop of Opposition John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from "anonymous directors" and "advanced users" in utility firms.
The plans of the opposition minister also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not regain their full share as a Labour government may make a "deduction" based on perceived misconduct.
It also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create Inclusive Own Funds to give 10 per cent of the equity of private sector firms to employees, who are willing to take annual dividends up to €500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" if the Kavanaugh FBI investigation can change their understandings
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Bert Kavanaough delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by one week, raising the question whether the findings of the Board could influence a Republican mayor to withdraw his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague than South Carolina.
"Eh, and surely," said Kennedy.
"I said and I entered the hearing, and I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after he issued that allegation, and I said, "Did you make it?"
He was resolved, determined, inequivocous."
However, Graham's vote seems difficult to change.
"I've already decided about Brett Kavanaough and must be a very great accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasy Ford.
"And any person mentioned cannot verify it.
It is 36 years old.
I haven't seen anything new change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
Next Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a very impressive list of stars that will appear and an equally impressive mission; ending the world's poverty.
Now, in his seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people free for the Great Law of Central Park to not only enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Six Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Power Project, a representative group with the hope of ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless I was willing to pay a VIP ticket), the concerters had to finish a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, send an electronic letter to a world leader, make a call or other significant ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the remaining 12-year-old Global Citizen achieved its goal?
The idea of people being rewarded with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clictivism" - people feel that they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says that it has registered more than 19 million "action" than its supporters, which I pursue for a number of different objectives.
This states that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37 billion expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announced its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that secure funds have so far made a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "help children grow to their full potential," promising Rwanda to provide $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after having received more than 4,700 tweet from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Traction Ulman to the crowd during a direct concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to invite the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequent questions on his website asking "what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like large movements of civil rights and against partnerhead, we will succeed, because we have more power when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Six Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the artists who will appear at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Florence and Hugh Jackman.
The US uses the Naval Fleet for "blocking" to hinder Russian energy exports - Internal Secretariat
"If necessary", Washington may resort to its Naval Fleet to prevent Russian energy from affecting markets, including the Middle East, has revealed the United States Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examinr.
Zinke alleged that Russia's enlargement in Syria – especially, where it is operating with a legitimate government invitation – is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he alleged.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of addressing this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Naval Fleet, to ensure that sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy has not reached the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing those who attended the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that called itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
It continued to compare Washington approaches in addressing Russia and Iran, noting that these are effectively the same.
"The economic choice on Iran and Russia is, slightly or too, fuel leverage and replacement," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-capable person" with an economy dependent on fuel fuels.
The following statements are made as Trump's administration was on a mission to strengthen its liquefied natural gas export to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of Trump's administration, including the US President Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to exit from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas project, which according to Trump, made Berlin the "password" of Moscow.
Moska has repeatedly stressed that North Stream 2 of $11 billion, which is expected to double the existing gas input capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's intense opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of Germany for industry, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), invited the US to stay away from Europe's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will "Examine Us" If you do not go out for a president in 2020, Tell the Mayor of Massachussets
The Mayor of Massachussets Elizabeth Warren, Saturday said that she would "examine well" whether she would go to a president after the mid-term elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachussets, Warren confirmed that it would consider leaving.
"It's time for women to go Washington and repair our broken government and this includes a woman in the highest position," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will examine whether I will go out for a president."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump at the council meeting, saying that he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was direct in her criticism of Trump and his nomination to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaough.
On Friday, Warren said "we naturally need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey issued on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own constituents do not think that it should be elected in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" votes of Massachusts said that the mayor should not be elected, according to the survey of the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the election issue.
The survey showed further support for the election by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting and 48 per cent against a potential election.
Other high profile democratic names that have been discussed in relation to potential elections for the 2020 election include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said that it would decide officially by January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin refers to the PTSD of Track Palin in the display of Donald Trump
26-year-old Track Palin spent one year in Iraq after his registration in September
He was arrested and brought before an incident of domestic violence on Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he returns, I can relate to other families who feel the compassions of the PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers return with," she told the audience in a demonstration for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the obvious problem that no one is addressing" and said about her son and other war veterans, "they return a little different, they return stronger, they hesitate to think if there is that respect for what other soldiers like them and air personnel, and every other member of the military, gave to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wesilla, Alaska, and was brought up on a domestic violence attack against a woman, during which he interrupted a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons while he was drinking, according to this Bennet, speaking to the Department of Police of Wasila.
18 states, D.C. supports a challenge to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District are supporting a legal challenge to a new US policy to deny asylum to victims fleeing from gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district, Friday brought a court friend case in Washington to support an asylum-seekers challenging the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the actor in the case of Grace against Sessions which the American Civil Liberties Union presented in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and the boys members of his violent gang," abused her but the US officials rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
It was held in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, producing a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, as the nations are facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy returned a 2014 decision by the Board of Appeal of Migrants which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Friday, in a statement, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said that the new policy "neglects decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum claims to be judged on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a motive violates this principle, said the case of a court friend.
The lawyers continued to argue in the event that the policy of denying immigrants income harms the US economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work".
Advocate-General Jeff Sésions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Absoluteness is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in his policy announcement on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems -- even all serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Deprived rescue efforts in Pallu as the number of deaths doubles in the fight against time to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become increasingly terrible.
"It feels very intense," said a 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while she was embracing her son with a fever in an evacuation centre in the town of Palu.
"Every minute ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents appeared to return to their destroyed homes, looking in their stuff flooded with water, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, destroyed by the 7.5 earthquake, were overfilled.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Harris, which suffered a back and shoulders fracture, remained outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to ongoing healthy shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he told the story of the violent earthquake moving the floor of the hotel in the fifth floor he was using with his wife and daughter.
"There was no chance of saving ourselves.
I crushed with the rest of the wall, I think," Harris said to Associated Press, adding that his family was at the place for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda adverts"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper issued an ad on four pages in a US daily newspaper trying to sell the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador for China accused Beijing of using the American picture to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to China Daily's paid supplement in the De Moines Register - the newspaper that is sold mostly in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of seeking to interfere with the US Congress elections on 6 November, accusing China of rejecting it.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections marked what US officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in a run-off campaign from Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to make adverts to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently fitted to an ongoing trade war which has seen them pass tariffs on the imports of each of them.
China's retaliation fees at the beginning of the commercial war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa who supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Brand, US ambassador for China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods for China, said that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Brand on an opinion page at the Sunday's De Moines Register, "now doubles this billing by making propaganda adverts in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the precious tradition of America of free expression and free press by putting a paid advert in the De Moines Register," wrote Brandtad.
"In contrast, on the press stand down the road here in Beijing, you will find voices of limited dissemination and you will not see a true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China's problematic economic stratification, as the media are under the restriction of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
The Republicans Are Aliening Women Votes Prior to the Mid-term Elections by the Kavanaough Debate, Alert Analysts
As many Republicans of the top are supporting and defending the nomination of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh while facing various allegations of sexual attack, the analysts warned that they would see an adverse reaction, particularly during the forthcoming mid-term elections.
Feelings about this have been very high, and most Republicans are already officially showing that they wanted to conduct by vote.
These things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that the last minute push of Mayor Jeff Flick (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national speakers for the progressive MoveOn Friday group, according to the Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators sang "Next November!" as they protested in the Senate Hall as the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to run with the designation of Kavanaough despite the statement by Dr Christine Blasy Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high, said Stu Rothenberg, a non-participatory political analyst to the news site.
"People are saying they were already high; and true.
"But they may be higher, particularly among women voters who turn to vote in under- and younger voters, 18 to 29 years of age, who, while the president does not like them, often do not vote."
As a member of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, he was responsible for the violent repression against the civilian population of the Republic of Crimea and the illegal annexation of the Russian Federation.
"This has become a complete confusion for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"This does not only concern the vote of the committee or the final vote on whether Kavanaough is put on the bank, it also concerns the way in which the Republicans handled this situation and how they handled it," indicated to the news station Guy Cecil, director of the priorities USA, a group that helps to elect the Democracies.
However, Americans appear to be in some way divided over believers in the light of Ford and Kavanaough's declarations, with little more support for the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents firmly or probably believed Ford's statement, while 35 percent said that they firmly or probably believed Ford's statement.
In addition, 38 per cent said that they thought that Kavanaough probably or definitely lied during his statement, while 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
Following the push by Flick, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as at least another accused, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed before the Judicial Committee of the Senate under oath last week that Kavanaough had attacked her while he was drinking at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that the nomination of the Supreme Court exposed his genitals to her while they were in a festival while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Investor plans to Start a New Internet to compete against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, will launch a new business that seeks to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the solid-source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee complained that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domain."
"We have to do it now," said he about the new business.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal online data store" or POS.
This may include contact lists, lists of what to do, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spopfity were all available on one and all browsers at the same time.
What makes a single online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to access what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal autonomy through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce's company CEO, is that the company brings adequate resources, process skills and skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform brought by IBM, some staff developers who have a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
By starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications through the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all their business models are turned down from today to tomorrow.
"We are not asking for their permission."
On a medium spot published on Saturday, Berners-Le wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Le transformed the Internet when it set up a World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Le will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic for this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Clergy Celebration of World War I Victoria Cross
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won Victoria Cross during World War I as combatants was celebrated in his village 100 years later.
Lt Col Il-Reverend Bernard Van won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack in Belenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
Saturday a memorial stone was discovered by his two grandsons in a parapet in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that it was "smartly symbolic" that the stone had to be uncovered exactly 100 years after the victory of his grandfather's prize.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, the Lt Kor led his battle across the Channel de Saint-Quentin "in many fog and fire from on-site guns and machine gun."
Later he rushed to the fireline and with "the greatest courage" led the line forward before he went to a rifle on the spot alone and lost consciousness of three of the troops.
The Lt Kor was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just one month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never get there but something very humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Van also placed a girl after the paralyse, which was led by the Brentwood imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that he was "very honored to have played a role in this parapet" and added "the courage of a true hero was shown by the support to be given by many people."
MMA parties remained awake all night to see Bellator 206, instead of ending with Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see Belator 206 packed to end up denied seeing the main event.
The list by San José included 13 fights, including six on the main card and were shown direct overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
In 6am, as Gerard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK remained pale when the broadcast was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they remained awake until early hours, especially for fighting.
One party on Twitter described the change to children's cards as "some kind of common joke."
"It is a government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was not appropriate therefore had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of Bellator's marketing and communication, when asked about transmission.
"Peppa the pig," yes."
The president of the company Belator Scott Coker said that they would work on their scheduling to include viewers from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, we probably can fix something," said Coker.
"But now there are six in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to arrange until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we are working on it.
Emme, when the broadcast was turned over, there were many and not all messages going on.
We were trying to fix the solution, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it was not, it was a governmental issue.
I can promise you that the next time you don't happen.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and have tried to get more to the supporters and instead to go too far.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dally felt "less" because of sex
The Olympic Passer Tom Dally says that he has grown to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said that he had not realized it until he went to the secondary that "not everyone like me."
Speaking about the first Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent he became less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-standing programme, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of illness.
While he appeared to be an abandoned person on Laverne's first programme, Dally said that they felt "less than anyone else" as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable for you to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those emotions that feel less than, and you feel different, have been the true things that gave me the power and strength that I can succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something", said, not to disappoint everyone when they eventually get to know about his sexuality.
The Bronze Olympic medalist twice became a high profile promoter for LGBT and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt that he could live freely without rags and wanted to give hope to others.
The world winner for three times said that when he became a man-friendly film producer from the United States Dustin Lance Black, he met in 2013 - "was surprised" for him.
Dally married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he is, last year but said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When he went through so many things at such a young age - he went to his first Olympics at 14 years of age and his father died with cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar beautiful and painful experiences.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Dally, and Dally said that his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, to me the important was to 'I want to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are things bigger than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 40 years after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dally said that his father did not accept that he would die and one of the things he had asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012 - since he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "You're not going to be here to be in the front row," said he.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally recognized that it was not inviolable," he said.
The following year Dally competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - that I would stand in front of a crowd from countries in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspires the first choice of his song - a Heather Small Proud - with which it was compatible in the Olympic march and which is still cold.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mikkelson who is no longer in shape remains on the bank at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will record Saturday when he plays his 47 game of the Ryder Cup, but will have to change his form to avoid being such an important stage of happiness.
Mikkelson, who plays in the biannual event for a 12-time record, remained on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's footballs and Forums.
Instead of being the centre of the action, as it was often for the United States, the great winner of five times divided his day between supporting and working on his game from the distance with the hope of rectifying his concerns.
One who would never have given the ball right even in the midst of his career, the 48-year-old man is not ideal for the difficult course of Le Golf National, where the long distance once again corrects wrongs.
And if the course alone is not of enough heart, Mikkelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faces the precise champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, a new one for the season, to win all four of their games this week.
If Americans, with four points less than at the beginning of the 12 single games, start well, the Mikkelson game can prove to be a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, taped on my back and put his arms around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"There is a lot of confidence in itself.
It is Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably did not see him playing two parties.
I've seen more, but this is the way it worked and this is the way we thought it would go.
He must be out there, like others."
Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's record for the most Rider Cup items played on Sunday.
This can mark the end of a Rider Cup career which has rather never reached the millions of its individual record.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven-halfs, although Furyk said his presence brought a few intangible things to the team.
"It puts you in, sarcotics, funny, loves to hug you with people, and a very good man to have you in the team room," explained.
"I think the younger players were happy to criticize him, this week, which was something fun to see.
It provides much more than just games."
European master Thomas Bojrn who the great front position can quickly disappear
Thomas Bojrn, European master, knows from experience that a leading position measured before the last day's singles in Cup Ryder can easily be converted into a comfortable journey.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point advantage over Americans but ended with a truly narrow margin slide, with a victory of 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great lead position in Valderrama; we had a great lead position in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a little," said Bojn, in the picture, after seeing the 2018 class winning 5-3 both Friday and yesterday to be on a 10-6 foothold in the Gulf National.
So the story will show me and everyone in this team that has not finished everything yet.
Tomorrow you go with your soul and your body.
Get out there and do all the good things.
It has not been over until you have brought the points on the team.
We have a goal, and what we try to do is welcome this turn, and the focus remains there.
I've always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know exactly what the other side is - the world's biggest players."
Content of how his players played on a difficult golf course, Bojrn added: "Never go step oltrè from me into this.
A different challenge remains.
It still concerns the individual performances we see, and this is something different what to do.
It is very nice to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when there is out individually, then it is tested for your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message that you have to pass to the players, which comes out your best tomorrow.
Now, leave your partner behind and he wants to leave and get out his best, too."
In contrast to Bojrn, the opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to play better individually than when they did as partners, with the exceptions that Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas, who acquired three points from four.
Furyk himself was on the two sides of the last few days that could change everything, after he was part of the winning team in Brookline before the end of a riot as Europe made the "Medinah Miracle."
"I remember at least a word from it," said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the master in 1999, prepared his players before the last day.
"We still have 12 important items, but you want to get to that start as soon as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw in Mediah.
When that momentum reaches one side, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle parties.
We have drawn up our list as appropriate and put those men in the way we felt, you know, we are trying to do a few miracles tomorrow."
Thomas had been given the task of trying to lead the fight back and facing Roy McIlroy in the best game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the best half of the order.
"I went with this group of men in this way because I think it covers all the way," said Bojron about his single choices.
Germany's new war postponed again
The newest German Naval Fleet frame had to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the ageing War Wartime frames, but it will not be until at least next year due to systems with increasing defects and costs, reported by local media.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the famous new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a spokesman for the military.
The vessel had to join the Naval Fleet in 2014, but the problematic post-delivery issues bore the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuertemberg class vessels that ordered the Naval Fleet back in 2007 will come as a replacement for the ageing Bremen class frames.
It is understood that they will have a strong presence, a display of missiles against aircraft and ships as well as some cateal technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signers.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods – this should be possible to operate the newest freezers up to two years away from home ports.
However, a continuous delay means that the last technology vessels - mentioned to allow Germany to project an offshore power - will already be old enough to enter into service, noting Die Zeit.
F125 of bad luck appeared in the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Naval Fleet returned a ship to shipbuilders after it was delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for this, but German media quoted a number of key "software and hardware defects" that made the ship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important as the Baden-Wuertemberg class ship will be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers - only half of the workers on the older Bremen class frame.
In addition, it appeared that the vessel has a very heavy weight to reduce its performance and limit the ability of the Naval Fleet to add future updates.
The 7,000 tonnes "Rheinland-Pfalz" is understood to be twice as heavy as similar class vessels used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the full project price - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached an alarming amount of €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - from an initial €2.2 billion.
The problems of the newest framers become especially important in the light of recent warnings that the German naval power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, recognised that the Naval Fleet currently "has a shortage of vessels to withstand deployment."
The official said that the problem had grown over time, as old ships had been commissioned but replacement ships had not been provided.
It complained that none of the Baden-Wuertemberg class framers could have joined the Naval Fleet.
National Trust is mentioned on the secret life of bats at night
New ground research in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape when looking for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of single flying mammals and help to guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistreles as well as long-eared brown-night bats and Daubenton in the Inverwe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key real estate locations to trace the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
An expert analysis of the sound of all recordings will check the frequency of bat calls at night and what species is doing.
A habitat map will then be produced and a report will create a detailed picture of their landscape scale of behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats at night and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grazing and how best to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats during the night in Scotland and across the UK has decreased considerably over the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development work affecting nests and habitat losses.
Wind and light turbines can also pose a risk, as can poison paper to catch insects and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
The bats are currently not blind.
However, because of the traditions of their nottourina hunting their ears are more useful than their eyes when they come to catch prey.
They use sophisticated eco-locality techniques to indicate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously at night.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, house inspections and sometimes rescue.
The organisation has even established the first and only nightly reserve of Scots in the Terrave ground in Dumfries and Galloway, which hosts eight of the ten species of bats in the night of Scotland.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is their ideal territory.
"This is in Therave we have a very good area for bats tonight," said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitats.
But there is much more about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
It stresses the importance of checking bats for maintenance in properties as it is possible that unintended destruction of a single maternity home could kill up to 400 women and young people, possibly destroying a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or grieve them or destroy their houses.
Elizabeth Ferrel, a Scottish staff member for the Night Whale Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We have much to learn about our bats at night and for most of our species we still don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations as soon as the lawyers are ready to seek a German magazine
Christino Ronaldo noted rape claims against him as "false news," saying that people "must promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are expected to seek with court the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The player of Portugal and Juventus who plays the lead was accused of rapeing an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He alleged that he had paid $375,000 at the time to not say anything about the accident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking on video on Instagram Live with his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, noted the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the winner of Ballon d'Or five times looking at the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It is normal.
They must be famous to say my name, but this is part of the work.
I'm a happy man and everything's going well," the player added, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to seek out Der Spiegel in court on allegations, which they called "unnecessary reporting of privacy suspicions," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz said that the player seeks compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident was reported to have taken place in June 2009 in a room in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly took it from the anus, according to documents submitted at the District Court of Clark County in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knee after the alleged accident and told her that he was "99 per cent" "well-man" disappointed by the "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that both had sex, but that this was by consensus.
Mayorga also argues that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court solution because she felt "throwed by a retaliation" and was concerned that "it would be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old wife says she is now looking to switch the solution as soon as she is traumatised by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo had come to join Real Madrid by Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he walked with Italian football legends Juventus in an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "dismisses forever" which has lost car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "departs forever" if it loses its status as world leader in the manufacturing of cars after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "an issue" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of Brexit of no agreements would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Auris and Avensis of Toyota - produced almost 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a stop in production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the management director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, states that it will close its Mini plant for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the case of Brexit of no agreements.
Toyota's production line works today on a "accurate-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for cars made in order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be border disruptions which industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to maintain an inventory of more than one day at its Derbyshire plant, said the company, and therefore production would be discontinued.
Mr Clark says that Theresa May's Chiequers plan for future relations with the EU is "accurately calibrated to avoid these border controls."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that allows, as I say, not only the success to enjoy at present but to seize this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue what was a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not claim for how long production was stopped, but over a longer period it warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the defendant of the Unite Union at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience when these jobs leave, never come back.
A spokesman for the government said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rossenetin can be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's risky meeting with the deputy general lawyer Rod Rossentein could be "delayed by another week" as the fight on the nomination of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continued, said White House on Sunday.
Rosentein is responsible for the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, investigating the Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's aid and Russia and a potential obstruction of justice by the president.
If Trump is to exclude the deputy general lawyer or not, thereby jeopardising Mueller's independence, he urged Washington's rival for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wire clothing to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by means of 25 amendments.
Rossintene rejected the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, although there were reports he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, which was then located at the United Nations in New York, which was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said that he "prefers not" to expel Rossentein but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid confusion with the hearing of the Senate judicial committee in which Kavanaough and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom gave testimony.
On the basis of the above, the Commission concludes that the measures in question constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
On Sunday, the press secretary of Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When asked about the Rossentein meeting, she said: "It has not yet been set a date for this, it may be this week, and the following week may be held because of all other things going on with the supreme court.
But now I see and I always love to keep the picture up-to-date."
Some journalists contest this assertion: Sanders has not organised a press meeting in the White House since 10 September.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of meetings was not due to a lack of grace with TV journalists "to try to attract and influence the audience", although she said: "Although I agree with the fact that they try to attract and influence the audience."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the picture would be increased.
"The president holds more questions and answers sessions compared to any agreed president," she added, without quoting any evidence: "Look at those numbers."
The meetings will still be held, she said Sanders, but "If the picture has the chance to ask questions directly to the US president, this is much better than talking to me.
We try to do this a lot and we have seen to do so many times in the last few weeks and this will replace the press meeting where one can talk to the US president."
Trump rarely answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting the demigods.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he behaves mildly and sometimes strangely in front of groups of journalists.
The health secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland on the fears related to Brexit
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the gratitude and desire of the country that they remain there after Brexit.
Jane Freeman MSP sent a letter when less than six months remain for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to the cost of applications of defined status for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue continued, moving towards the decisions expected this autumn.
But the Government of the United Kingdom was also increasing its preparations for a possible scenario of no agreement.
I know this is certainly an unstable time for all of you.
That is why I want to support now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, irrespective of their nationality.
Fellows from across the EU, and beyond, bring with them valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and are beneficial to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely home and I very much want you to stay here."
Chrision Abercrombie Makes Emergency Surgeon After He has suffered an injury in Rassus
The Tennesse State Tigger Abercrombe Linebacker Christion performed emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday when his team lost against the Vanderbilt Commodores by 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The main state coach of Tennesse Road Red told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the halftime.
"He went on the sideline and fell there," said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff gave oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before putting him on a sticker and took him back for further examination.
State official of Tennesse told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was no longer operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that "so far there is no detail about the type/extendment of the injury" and the Tennessee State is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombe, a student in the second year of the suspended university, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after leaving Illinois.
Saturday in all he had five sickles before leaving the game, which led to a total of 18 sickles of his season.
Foreign buyers will be required to pay more stamp tax when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign purchasers will be required to pay more stamp tax when buying excess money property in the UK used to help homeless persons under new Tory plans
This change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in stamp tax will be imposed on non-taxable persons in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects it to rise to €120 million a year - to help homeless people
Today Teresa May will announce that foreign buyers should pay a higher rate of stamp tax when buying property in the UK – with extra money used to help homeless people.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and target high-paid earners.
The increase in stamp tax will be imposed on non-taxable individuals and firms in the UK, with extra money boosting the Government's efforts to fight road sleep.
The additional payment - which is additional to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second houses and rental purchase - may be three per cent.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to €120 million per year.
Some 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by non-United Kingdom residents, who are increasing prices and thus making it more difficult for new buyers to make a first step in the purchasing of housing.
Many rich areas of the country – particularly in the capital – have become "famous cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending much of their time abroad.
The new policy was issued only a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in stamp tax to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms that were keeping property prices high by seizing and not using land, and urged Ms May to abandon allowances on affordable housing to remedy the "housing shame" situation in the UK.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed residence reforms, including rent controls and the end of "no fault" dismissals.
He also wants to give the councils great powers to build new houses.
Ms May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my post to restoring the UK's dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And this means fixing the broken market for our housing.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, find it easy to buy housing as well as UK residents.
For many people the dream of having a home has become too far, and the indivisibility of sleeping on the streets remains very real."
Jack Rose: "My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland"
The head of Sunderland Jack Ross says that his "fundamental ambition" is to ever become the manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scottish welcomes the challenge of revitalising the North-East club, which is currently in third place in the League One, with three different points than in the first place.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after guiding St. Mirren back to the Scotish Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to play for countries as a player.
I got B cap and nothing more," Ross told Sportson of the BBC of Scotland.
"But when I was still a child I often went with my father to see Scotland playing in Hampden, and it always remains the thing that drew me back.
However, this opportunity only comes if I succeed in managing a club."
Formers of Rose as manager of Sanderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Atletic says that he was not concerned about the fact that he would follow such established names in such a large club, while he had previously rejected the offer from the City of Barnsley and Ipswich.
"At present, success for me will be based on "I can get this club back to Premier League?"
Given the structure and facilities of this club there is no doubt that this club belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I probably think I've succeeded here only if I can take the club back there."
Ross only three years in his career as manager, after a period of deputy chief in Dumbarton and after spending 15 months with He Arts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from the olegixins for the third category, and transformed St Mirren from the edge of the olegixins to winners of the title of the following season.
And Ross says that now he is feeling more comfortable than during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepoul, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
As for the time when Alloa took over, he recalled that "probably this was a big change."
"I naturally thought that the position of manager was the most suitable for me, much more than that of a player.
This may sound strange by going well, having a decent life, and enjoying some reasonable achievements.
But games can be difficult.
There are many things you have to go through every week.
I still experience this in terms of stress and work pressure but I just feel that the post of manager is right for me.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I feel that throughout my adult life now I feel the most comfortable."

Survey finds that the best time to take a beer pin is at 5.30pm in the evening
The summer heat wave boostd the profits of the UK’s people in difficulty but put more pressure on the restaurants of the same company.
In July, groups of people and bars saw a 2.7 per cent increase in sales – but figures revealed that the return on restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business advisory CGA, who collected the figures, said: "The continuous sun and the longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar model for the previous month of June, when sales in the public increased by 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were even more affected.
The reduction of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trade in June continued to worsen in July.
The parties and the bars whose main sales are drinking were those which went most well in terms of the financial results compared to the previous period while the sales of restaurants decreased.
The public whose main sales are food have also suffered in heat, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to get out drinking.
In the people and bars managed the sale of beverages increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food fell to three per cent."
Paul Newman, one of RSM's analysts regarding entertainment and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors as regards the sale on the market of take-aways.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent a year after a year will be particularly burdensome in addition to continuing cost pressures.
The hot and long summer could not have come at a worse time for operators whose main sales are food and only time can give us advice on whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much needed rest."
The growth of total sales in the public and restaurants, including the opening of new businesses, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow pace of start-up of new businesses.
The monitoring of the sales of the Coffer Peach Tracker industry for the UK public, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses the performance data from 47 operational groups, with combined revenues of more than €9 billion, and is the industry's established benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts hiding from their parents
A survey reveals that one in five children - some of them aged 11 - have secret social media accounts hiding from their parents and teachers
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the pages "Insta Falls"
News has great fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "key" account to show their parents
One in five children - some of them aged 11 - are creating social media accounts hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid growth in the "Insta's Follus" accounts - a reference to the site for the sharing of Instagram's photos.
The news has great fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operated a "core" account presented to show their parents, while having other private ones.
A mother who met her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a young woman who was encouraging others to take care of her - "stupid me."
The research, from Digital Health UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of young people aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, half of which admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that many young people are attracted to creating online spaces where parents and their teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will become the "voy for athletes" at the board of the Scottish athletics
Eliidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish athletic board as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the athlete most of the course rather than the athlete who has won medals and president Ian Beattie described this change as a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from its vast experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by becoming part of the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help to lead sport in Scotland."
The Americans, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Games in Atlanta among its total of four Olympic Games gold medals and who is now regular criticism of the BBC, have ended up not moving after having suffered a small stroke.
On Twitter he wrote: "As today you give me a month of stroke.
I couldn’t walk.
The doctors said that only time can give us advice if I do not recover or to what extent.
It was a strike job but I recovered completely, I learned how to resuscitate and I am doing agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Recycling the breast pump comparing mothers to cows gives rise to different opinions online
A breast pump company has given rise to different opinions online by advertising comparing breast-feeding mothers with breeding cows.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered to be the "first world breast pump that can be worn and not make noise" , the consumer technology company Elvie issued an adverted by an Ionian music video to show the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers using the breast pump.
Four real mothers dance in a candle full of cow straw with a disc that includes a word like: "Yes, I am making a fool of myself but I have no tail" and "In case I don't think they're not a goat but my chest."
The curriculum continues: "Pump out, pump out, I'm feeding my babies, pump out, pump out, I'm milking my women."
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, the video received different reactions from viewers, with many saying that it sheds light on the "terror" of the milk industry.
Someone wrote "It was a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken to them within a few days of giving birth".

Someone else commented: "One understands that this is a traumatic thing for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "Renewal is really cut off from reality."
Others defended the ad, with an admitted woman who found the disc "very fun."
"I think this is a paradise idea.
If I were still breast -feeding, I would buy one.
The pumping made me feel the same as a cow.
The advertising is a little or too crazy but I've taken it as it is.
This is a paradise product," wrote someone.
Someone else commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at pumping mothers (often at their workplaces or in toilets) and feels like "cows".
This is not an ad that praises or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video the group of women revealed that they were all dancing with the pumps they did not give to the eye placed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their chests say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump, does not make any noise, has no wire or tube and sits in a breast-feeding bar without giving it to the eye, thus giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even leave while they are pumping.
Anna Blarin, a partner and ECD in Mother commented: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing us to women using the breast pump with the dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breast pumping and all the challenges it brings, while showing fun and a way to relate to it, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time that Elvie pump appeared on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the catalogue for the designer Martha Jacobowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Moving Wordlessly to the Texas Border Camp
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply although the monthly border crossing has not changed too much, partly because of the historical and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration made it more difficult for children to be placed with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and they feared that if they presented themselves to take care of a child would endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their dormitories would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, witnessed to the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Almost 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or home members of sponsors are here illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
We are therefore continuing to search for these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to speed up the process involving children, officials have introduced new rules which will require some of them to appear in court within one month of their detention, instead of after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the shell workers.
Many will appear through a video conference, instead of personally, to bring arguments in favour of their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for aid will be transferred immediately.
According to smarter workers and reports emerging from the system in recent months, the more children are kept under custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which could lead to their violent expression or try to escape.
The lawyers said that these concerns would increase in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where it is more likely to ignore signs that a child is finding it difficult, given the size of the facility.
They added that the movement of children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to give their friends strength could lead to a trauma that many of them are already fighting.
Syria tells the "occupied forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
While addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as prime deputy minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be properly addressed."
"They shall withdraw immediately and without any condition," said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more being moved from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue "to fight this sacred battle until we are expelled from all Syrian territories" both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, many of which train and advise both the Kurdian forces and the Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the country destroyed by war.
With regard to the refugee issue, Moualem said that the conditions were right for them to return, and he said "in some Western countries" for "expanding in random fears" which led refugees to stay away.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are policy-making what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last strong major rebellion in Idlib created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale attack by Syrian forces supported by the Russians on the province, where three million people live.
However Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target the jihadists including the Al-Qaida-related Christian fighters, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and of the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem has established conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the team's work should be restricted "to review the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Second Command
With this logic, in 2020 Mr Trump will win the re-election as long as, as many free viewers are hoped, the denunciation and scandal end its presidency ahead of time.
What would undoubtedly be "The most dramatic final that has ever been in a chair!"
So far, it appears that viewers have not yet been able to paint.
Since 2014, time ratings with the highest number of viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in time with the largest number of viewers, more than 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Madow Show" has increased cable television ratings by even 3.5 million viewers on the nights of the main news.
"This is a situation that attracts people to it because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, presenter of the ABC drama program "Designed Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, writer of the Veteran comedy and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Faith Hard Truths About Being Into the Holy Boys" Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr Trump.
Why? questions she asked.
"He said, "Why welcome me," she said to me, "Ms. Scovell.
In this case there is a value of entertainment.
In contrast to anything else on TV, stories from Washington can no doubt determine the future of Roy v. Wade, if immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
To ignore what is happening around you is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And however, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself following a panel of experts discussing the use by Bob Woodward of a "deep background" source for his book "Fear," the boomer jacket with the skin of the nude ("honour- reflecting dress", said The Washington Post) of Paul Manfort with a value of $15,000 and the implications of the descriptions of Mr Trump's anatomy from Stromy Daniel.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"A part of what he's doing is as if it's a reality show is that every night he's giving you something," said Brent Montgomery, executive head of Weelhouse Entertain and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about the changing case and the development in the daily plot of the Trump programme (combat against N.F.L., thanks Kim Jong-un).
You cannot afford to lose one episode because it falls back.
When I met Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his house the weather was a sun at 80 degrees north coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
It could not have arisen in front of television, not when Brett Kavanaough was ready to face the Judicial Committee of the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
"I remember when we used to do those extracurricular programmes and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilisation," said Mr Fleisss.
"I thought it was a joke, but actually they were right."

Large amounts of money coming from abroad to the strongest race in the mid-term election of the White House
It is not surprising that the 17 congestion districts of Pennsylvania are seeing a large amount of money, thanks to the realignment of congestive districts which acquired two operators in a race for the same seat.
It recently re-established the pits of the sub-urban district of Pittsburgh by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is issuing as a candidate against another operator, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the 12 old Pennsylvania districts, which extends heavily to the 17 new districts.
The maps were re-established after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts were tampered with in a unconstitutional way in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the 17 new districts triggered a difficult competition of the financial campaign between the main party's weapons of finance, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republic Committee (NRCC) (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after winning with a little difference in the special election of March followed closely by the eighteenth Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That seat belonged to a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political critics have given the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered penalising El Salvador for supporting China, and then decided not to do so.
The diplomas noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little aid from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump held a reception meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and had a hotel in Panama until some partners dismissed the administrative team of the Trump Organisation.
The officials of the State Department decided to contact again the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "the recent decisions to stop recognising Taiwan," said the speakers of the Department Heather Nauret, in a statement at the beginning of this month.
However, the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received around $140 million in US aid in 2017, including narcotics controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been burdensome for the Central American country and its high unemployment and killing rates.
As the internal meetings began to progress, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, the officials of the highest administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with a view to effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence was strongly criticised to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance of the administration being placed on the meeting, said the diplomats.
And the three American envoys returned quietly back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new message or severe punishment from Washington.
Speaker of the White House, Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were supported by a foreign analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke of the condition of anonymity.
History Study
The next unexpected negative event could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on possible disruption of justice by Mr Trump, on which there is now very substantial evidence in the public register.
It is reported that Mr Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr Trump's campaign was agreed with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In the event that the Congress passes on to another person, Mr Trump will find himself responsible for that body, as he prepares to go back to the voters, and possibly a jury of his peers.
This involves a lot of uncertainties, and I do not aim to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – nor that of his equivalent in Europe.
There are options to be made by all of them on both sides of the Atlantic which will affect the length of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were willing to carry out a cup d'éat against Hitler, if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakis in Munich.
We did not succeed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such inflation points, and the inexhaustible march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Today Americans face many of these inflation points.
What are we going to do if Mr Trump leaves the Deputy Advocate General Rod Rossentein, the man who controls the fate of Mr Mueller's investigation?
Rossenetin has been in trouble since this document reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be recorded in a secret and speculative manner that is not suitable for the post.
Mr Rosenstein said the report of The Times was inaccurate.
"How will we answer if the F.B.I.'s new request for a new Brett Kavanaough investigation is incomplete or fair - or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual conduct and dishonest evidence?
And above all, in mid-terms will we vote for Congress which will hold Mr Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, it will take time to move towards democracy.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the house of my ambassadors.
She was able to live, migrate to America and, 60 years later, on the day of God's worship sent me to light the candles on that table with the swastika.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorans of the Rangers is located optimistic before the competitive game with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against Austrians, following the impressive equal outcome they brought in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorans from making its first appearance of the season until the equal result of 2-2 with Villarreal but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a catalyst for big things.
"This was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old wombs.
"We entered the game with the belief that we could get something and we came out with a point.
We probably could have finally won it but, all in all, an equal result was probably a fair result.
Probably they were better in the first half of the game while we went better in the second half.
Thursday will be a great European evening again.
We hope that we can achieve three points but this will be difficult because they had a good outcome in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I am sure that we can continue to do our best and achieve a positive outcome.
Last year has certainly been difficult, between all that has happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but there is a sense of optimism at present.
The team is good and the boys are very happy; the training is good.
I hope we can do our best now, forget the last season and succeed."
Women are concerned about this fear related to retirement savings
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be supervised, few people were talking to their family members about this.
About half of the subjects in the Nationalwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to be a family member who drives them around, but they're not taking steps to have a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance business.
You should start that way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes well before time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you will receive treatment, as those options may be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Get your financial adviser: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a life insurance policy with hybrid money value to help cover these costs or self-insurance for your own good - provided you have money.
Take a decision after discussing your legal documents in the long term: Avoid legal battles.
Find healthcare care to select a reliable individual to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
In addition, consider proxy for your finances.
Select a person who trusts to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you are disabled.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"Not only are the finances involved, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
See that plan ready."
A man has been hit several times by a gun in IIfracombe
A man has been hit several times by air gun races as he was walking home after an evening outside.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of IIfracombe, Devon, when he was hit by a armor in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "a random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police called for witnesses.
Terremos and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, said the officials, with the number of deaths expected to increase.
With damage to the lines of communication, aid officials could not obtain any information from the judgment of Dongala, which is an area in the north of Palu which is closer to the earthquake centre with a strength of 7.5.
In Pallu, more than 16,000 people were evicted after the disaster.
These are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, about the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck the city, it was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a response extending over 300 km (180 miles) of the coast in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The response, an administrative region under a province, had a population of around 29,000 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the economy of the Central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
The nickel mine is also important in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Moroual, on the coast of the other side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, Tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Tonga.
In 1996, Tsunami also hit the west side of Dongala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Ring of the Pacific Semitic Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake hit 14 countries on the west coast of Aceh Province of Indonesia in the upper part of Sumatra triggered a tsunami, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a force of 6.8 hit southern Java, which is Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast with great force, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a force of 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, the capital city of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 hit one of the islands of Mentawai, beyond Sumatra, triggering a 10-foot tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A low earthquake struck Pidie Jaya's leg in Aceh, which caused destruction and panic as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunamis were triggered, but more than 100 were killed because of damaged buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the top of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of temporarily isolated tourists.
The largest child of Sarah Palin Aresta on Domestic Violence Claims
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of attack.
Palin, aged 29, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, which interfered with a report of domestic violence and which resisted arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female informant tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su Capital Facility and is being held on an insecure bond of $500, reported by the KTU.
He appeared to the court on Saturday, declaring himself "certainly, not guilty" when asked to give his motive, reported the network.
Palin is facing three Class A crimes, i.e. he can be imprisoned for up to one year and has to pay a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of a Class B crime, which is punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been made against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veterans Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of a domestic attack, which interfered with the report of a domestic violence crime, and of having a weapon in his possession while he was drinking in connection with the incident.
His girl alleged to have hit her with a pin in her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by the veterinary groups following a comparison between the violent behaviour of her child and the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with a power of 7.5 triggered tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication networks are not working with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck only a few out of the Sulawesi centre located to the north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakart.
Videos showing the moment of impact are circulating on the media.
Hundreds of people had been gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore with great force.
Federal prosecutors are requesting that the suspected terrorist attack of NYC be sentenced to a rare death penalty
Federal prosecutors in New York are asking that Sayfullo Saipov who is suspected of the terrorist attack of the city of New York that killed eight people be sentenced to death - a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a rental truck of Home Depot to carry out a road attack for bicycles along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, by flying in October to the pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to the notice on the intention to claim the death penalty, presented in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, these two heads of the charge bear a possible death penalty.
As a result of the attack, a federal jury has given Saipov 22 chief accused of including eight murder charges with the aid of organised re-introduction, typically used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
When describing the way Saipov carried out this attack "soft, cruel and immoral", the prosecutors said that the attack required "substantial pre-planning and meditation."
Notice of intent states that "Syfulllo Habibullavic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clives, Ann-Lauure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the recent Southern District of New York, which triggered a death penalty.
The imputant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after having been found guilty of conspiracy to carry out an explosion to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were killed by means of the electricity chair on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of reserves in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt well about what he did, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he inspired himself to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his mobile phone, depending on the head of the charge.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, said the police.
He answered not guilty for 22 chiefs of the charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were “certainly disappointed” by the prosecution decision.
"We think that the decision to claim the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty motive for his life in prison with no possibility of release will continue to prolong only the trauma of these events to anyone involved," said Paton.
Saipov's defence team previously asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
MP Tory says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the conference in Tory, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the army of the people".
The former head of the Ukip said that politicians had to "feel under pressure" by Eurosceptics – as one of the MPs of Teresa May himself suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
The government member of the Conservative Party Peter Bonn told the demonstration in Birmingham that until now the UK "would have issued" if Mr Farage had been Secretary of the Brexit.
But the challenge facing Ms May to reconcile her highly divided positions has been highlighted by Tories, who is not in favour of Brexit, who joined a separate protest against the Brixit in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to keep her Chiequers' compromise plan on the right track among the attacks by the Brexitiers, the Brexitists and the EU.
The allies insisted that despite the negative reaction it would continue to move forward to seek an agreement with Brussels – and force Eurosceptics and the Labour party to choose between its package and the "kaos".
Mr Boone told the Rally Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted "to put aside the plan of Cheequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be given a high social position and should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have been out so far," he said.
The MP Wellingborough added: "I will defend the Brexit but we need to put aside the Cheequers plan."
When he declared that he was against the EU, he said: "We have not fought a world war to serve us.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Boone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and must remain inconclusive."
Andrea Jenkyns, Brexitier of Tory, was also present for the demonstration, telling the journalists: "I want to just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The plan of the Cheequers is not popular with the general public, the Opposition will not vote for it, not popular with our party and with our activists who are actually those who go on the streets and who first vote for us.
Please forget the Cheequers plan and start listening."
In a message aimed at Ms May, she said: "The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians should "feel under pressure" if they were to depart from the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to go back from the Brexit and we're here today to tell them that "we're not going to let you do anything wrong if you do this."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he said: "I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is at the point of going back from the Brexit.
We are mobilising in the Brexit the army of the people of this country that has brought us success and will not spend until we have become an independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the anti-Brexit anti-Brexit went to Birmingham before making a two-hour rally in the centre of the city.
Following the launch of the group this weekend, a small number of activists visited flagers in writing Tories Against Brexit.
Lord Adonis, who has a high social position in the Labour party, mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with an app to the party as the conference opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all the IT systems in place and technology for Canada and more, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a whole herd.
The idea of a good Brexit does not exist," he added.
Warren intends to "examine carefully" the possibility of leaving for the presidential election
The United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections "examines carefully the possibility of leaving for the presidential election".
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the member of the Massachussets Democratic Party spoke about its future in a debate with citizens at municipal level in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will issue for re-election in November against the representative of the State GOP Geoff Dihl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusts in 2016.
She was in the centre of speculation that could replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with constituents who have been using the format of a debate with citizens at municipal level since Trump took office.
A person attending the meeting asked her if she intended to go out to the presidential election.
Warren replied that it was time "to go to Washington women to repair our fragmented government, and this includes a woman at the top."
Arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU SIMs
On Saturday, the police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect was arrested in connection with the shooting of the LSU Basketball Wayde Sims player that took place on Friday.
The Police Department of Baton Rouge announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson, at 11 a.m. ET News Conference.
Friday they issued a shooting video, asking for help to identify the man who appears in the video.
Sims, aged 20, was killed by a flight close to the campus of the Southern University on Friday morning.
According to 247 sports, the chief of police Murphy J. Paul told the media "Wayde Sims suffered a head injury and eventually died as a result."
Wyde came to defend his partner and was hit by a flight by Simpson.
Simpson was asked questions and admitted that he was on the scene, that he had a weapon, and admitted to shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and kept in custody in the Police Department of Parish Baton Roge East.
Sims, a young man who was six feet and grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starters last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 grounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches to obtain world title after his team's orders gave him the victory vis-à-vis Sebastian Vetel
On Saturday, from the moment Valteri Butatas qualified before Louis Hamilton, it was clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would have an important part in the race.
From the position on the inside in the first row, Botas had a good advantage and almost abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vetel to attack his partner.
Vetel was the first one to enter the stopping areas and allowed Hamilton to leave with the others in the last place of the group, something that would be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in the stop zone after another turn and exited immediately after Vetel, but Hamilton continued to move after a little action a bicycle with a wheel which made it difficult for the Ferri driver to leave the free inside because of the risk of being cut back after a double shift to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place until the end of the first round at the end of his years and at the age of 21.
He was then in the lead for most of the race by not changing his tyres with a view to quickly completing and exceeding Kimi Raikonen for the fourth place.
He eventually entered the zone of cessation in the 44th round but could not step up on the remaining eight rounds while Rikonen entered the fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valteri did a very good job throughout the weekend and it was a real genre said let me by.
The team did a really exceptional job to get the first and second place," said Hamilton.
That was a physically very bad attitude
President Donald Trump made a mockery of Senator Diane Feinstein in Rally on Saturday in connection with her persistence that she did not disclose the letter from Christine Blasey Ford that she was accusing the nominated person of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh of sexual attack.
When he spoke at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate of the Judicial Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "violous and disoriented and not sincere."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see the people who are angry and violent and disoriented and not honest," he said.
"When you look at statements and disclosures of information and then say "no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you detected any information?
Remember her answer... unveiled the document - "e, e, what is it?
No, you did not.
I haven't uncovered anything."
Look, wait a minute.
We've exposed... No, we haven't discovered," added he, while imitating the Senator.
Feinstein you sent her the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaough by Ford in July, and it was revealed earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the disclosure was coming from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not open her story," said Feinstein to the committee, reporting The Hill.
"She asked me to keep her confidential and I kept her confidential as she had asked."
But it seems that her rejection was not well received by the president, who, during the weekend's rally, commented: "You know what, that was a very bad physical behaviour.
You may not have searched, but what's the worst physical behaviour I've ever seen."
The President suggested that the Democratics were using the allegations for their purposes, while he continued his defence of the nominated person of the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three people.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the vitality, the disorder, they don't care about those who hurt, those who make bike sticks to gain power and control," said the president according to reports from Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer twice dark for the Gients against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for the loss of the Friday's Elliot League against Belfast Giants by winning the game against the same opponent 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants have gained an advantage of two early goouls in the game with two attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownei brought the same score for the team playing in his country before Dwyer again gained an advantage for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard obtained the same score for Dundee before two Gouls of Lukas Lundwald Nielsen confirmed their victory.
This was the third victory of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe players, who after many losses advanced to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
This was the fourth time this season that these two teams met, with Giants winning the three previous games.
Dwyer's first gooul took place in the fourth minute at 3:35 by a step from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford taking the step while Beauvilier doubling the advantage four minutes later.
In what was an opening period with much action, Sullivan brought back the team that is playing in his country back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Markardt gave a step to Cowney at 15:16 which brought the same score for both teams.
Dwyer ensured that Gients get an advantage up to the first pause of the game when he made his second gooul of the night at the end of the first period.
The team that is playing in his country has joined again and again thanks to Bouchard they have again reached the other team with a strong gooul at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcorn joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee an advantage for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and ensure the win with the fifth gooul for his team in the middle of the last period.
Gients, who now lose four of their last five games, will play in their country against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Control Dies to Ensure That Hundreds of people on the Aircraft Can Flee From the Terror
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is regarded as a hero after dying to ensure that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people can safely land.
More than 800 people died and many were lost after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which triggered tsunamis.
Strong threats continued to dominate the area and many were found trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues fled to survive, 21-year-old Joseph Antonius Gunwan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower he was snoring at Palu Airport, Mutara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
It remained calm to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which at the time was on the runway, could leave safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought it was breaking.
He died later in the hospital.
The speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirit, said that the decision probably saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News of Australia.
We had a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately left us this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"When we hear about this we feel a great noise," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency says that access to the cities of Dongala, Sgi and Botong is limited.
"It is estimated that the number is still increasing because many bodies were still under the debris while many could not be reached," said the speaker of the Sutopo Puro Nugroho agency.
The waves that reached up to six metres destroyed Palu in which Sunday will become a mass dance.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brings in the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
mini-markets are being stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is working hard to help those who are still alive but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
President of Indonesia Joko Widodo arrived in Pallu on Sunday and said to the military of the country: "I am asking you all to work night and day to complete every task related to evacuation.
Complete? reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man is lost after the aircraft accident in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight in the Pacific lake in Micronesia now says that a man is lost, after previously saying that the 47 passengers and crew members had safely fled from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement that from Saturday afternoon, she could not give details about where one man was located.
The airline stated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped to save passengers and other crew members after the aircraft hit the water when it tried to land at the Couuk Island airport.
On Friday the officials said that seven of the people were taken to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in a stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Naval Fleet both said that the Irish aircraft was in the lagoon a little away from the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane exceeded the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane came very low.
"This is a really good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to pass through the water which was high up to their feet until the exit of the emergency on the aircraft that was sinking.
He said that the flight assistants were planning and shouting, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that the seafarers working closely to improve moll also helped to save by using a boat that was ingested to carry passengers to the shore before the aircraft sank at about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
In addition, the Commission considers that the Commission's assessment of the compatibility of the measures with the internal market does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.
Analist presents an evening schedule in which a woman has been burned alive
Saturday the prosecution concluded its evidence on the case in the new process of a man who is accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014 while she was alive.
The US Department of Justice analyst Paul Roullett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described for the jury how he used mobile records to gather together information on the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19-year-old, on the night he died.
Roulette said that he received a location date from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the mobile data showed that he was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and witnessed that he was not in the city at the time.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said that that night he was in Sanford's truck, Sanford said that he was "a liar, since my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they knew each other only one week.
Roulette said that some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his mobile phone.
"He deleted it from his life," said Halle.
The defence is scheduled to initiate its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the process to be passed to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
Three hip hop artists must challenge the negative gender perspective by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip hop moved beyond its origin of political messages and is addressing social issues.
They want to go back to his roots and make the hip hop popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Comon have seen a recent rise in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nanny from NY drives a couple for having expelled her after a message "raziist"
Nancy from New York is driving a couple for discriminatory dismissal after he received an erroneous message from the mother who was complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny being racist, comparing the cause with "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed regret when she learned that the new child carer, Giselle Maurice, was a dark carnage when he arrived on his first working day in 2016.
"LEEEEEEE OTHER SINGLE PERSONA," wrote Ms Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Ms. Maurice, twice.
Noting her grave error, Plasco-Flaxman felt "cool" and expelled Ms Maurice, saying that her predecessor, who was an African-American, had not done her job well and that instead she was waiting for the Philippines, according to New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for her one working day and was then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is moving the couple for compensation in respect of dismissal, and is asking for compensation of $350 per day for the six-month living-in position for which she had initially been employed, although without a contract.
I want to show them, listen, I can't do such things," she said to Post Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple attacked the statements that they were racists, saying that the dismissal of Ms Maurice was the most reasonable thing they could do, fearing that they could not trust her after they had defended her.
"Martie sent her something she didn't intend to say.
She is not racist.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco said to Post.
"But if you trust your children in someone's hands that you talked about, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn?
And come on."
When comparing the cause with "extortion", Plasco said that it had been only two months since his wife had the baby and was "in a very difficult situation".
"Are you going to blame someone like that?
It's not a nice thing to do," he added the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly announced to the couple on social media, insulating them to their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not relate to a talker's course.
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who is reading it for the first time before it is published.
"It's really fun that we now know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman of the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book from a small game course, would certainly have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of publication of the books was "pleasant but a little darkened by the joke" after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was proud of his eventual success although he was never able to talk about it.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't filled with it himself," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like when you had a child to get something: be proud of them even if you didn't get something.
I think he was looking at the success of Paddington in that way.
Although he was the creation and his imagination, he always gave the virtue to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to give her the last peace on the phone
As soon as her daughter Landa was immediately taken to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked to save her life but it was all in vain.
"Nad was calling regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, which she was not expected to live," said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a call from Nad to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to give her the last peace.
And I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicines doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were slowing down and leaving her system slow.
She had died a little bit of time before and began to cross everything.
All I could do was sit down and wait, knowing that all of this is happening.
I could not scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I'd really have to hold back."
Eventually, Ms Ednan-Laperouse, who had been crying so far for her daughter's loss, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - who did not know the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had a low head, and tears began to fall all the time.
It was difficult to explain, but there was on the flight that I felt a great sense of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and to be told.
I knew how much he loved her."
Place cards of mourning women to avoid suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost a loved one in suicide are working to prevent others from getting rid of themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and telephone numbers that people could call for support.
Tyler, Ms. Davis' son, was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old, living in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew for his smile.
They always said that his smile was turning on every room."
However, he had to stop working before he died, because he was found "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Brother Tyler, then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had killed himself.
Ms. Davis said: "I am always afraid that this will be the cause of another bad event."
Ms. Davis created the cards, "to inform people that there are people you can open your heart to or meet, even as a friend.
Do not put into silence – you need to talk."
Ms Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms. Davis for years, lost her partner Mark for 15 years, not too long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or so," she said.
"In days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day was very bad - when the children opened their gifts did not make any contact with them with their eyes or anything like that."
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but they want to fight her: "Let it be empty in the family.
It wants us.
But all of us want to continue with our lives and fight."

In addition, the Commission considers that the measures in question constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.
"I said, if we could get something like what he called for -- a limited investigation in time, limited in scope -- we might have brought a little unity," said Mr. Flacke on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be "known" among the parties that raised the roots.
Why did Mr Kavanaough and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their relativism is entirely due to the choice of time.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November - if, as expected, the Republicans do not go well, in that case they will be severely weakened in their attempts to put the man they want to be elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was taking the phone to call the Mayors, to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaough, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and who met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What will happen after the FBI presents its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, where they currently occupy position 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaough can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, Vice-President, to vote and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
The number of deserts in North Korea "reducing" under Kim
The number of North Korean deserts for South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, said South Korean legislator.
Quoting data from the South Side Ministry for Unity, Park Byeong-seug said that last year there were 1,127 changes in the party – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates charged by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of deserters from the North Side will be offered venet citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most of them escape by passing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross compared to the Demilitarised Area (DMZ) which is highly protected between the two parts of Korea.
China views the deserts as illegal migrants instead of refugees and often sends them back to their country by force.
North-South relations – which are technically still in war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that were focused on stalling denuclearisation negotiations.
This took place after the historic meeting of June between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards the Korean nuclear-hazard-free peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho committed to the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, in no way will we be the first to remove weapons unilaterally," said Mr Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "sterical," stating that he is unable to work in the Supreme Court
The leaders of a minority of the Chamber Nancy Pelosi called the person nominated for the Supreme Court Mr Brett Kavanaough "sterical" and said that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because of his temporary behaviour.
Pelosi made these comments at an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't think that if a woman were ever to behave that way, they would say "sterical," said Pelosi about her reaction to the evidence of Kavanaugh before the Judicial Committee of Thursdays.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasy Ford when both of them were still young.
During his opening statement, Kavanaough was very excited, sometimes even shouting and smiling when he was talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democracies in the committee, calling the allegations against him "grotteska and coordinated character assessment" organised by the liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanawgh's witnesses had proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he qualifies himself with those declarations and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi was asked whether she would try to accuse Kavanaough if confirmed, and whether the Democrats would obtain a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say something -- if he's not telling the truth to the Congress or the FBI, so he's not able, not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also to be in the court that is currently in it," said Pelosis.
Kavanawgh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeal of D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as it is considered conservative justice.
In its confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether it would alter certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It is not appropriate for a person with stereotic prejudices to go to court and wait to say, "very well," said Pelosi.
And Women Need to Exercise Their Authority.
It is a fair verbal attack, months and years filled with anger, and she cannot say what she should say without crying.
"We cry when we're growing up," she told me the rich Steinem 45 years later.
"Don't I think this is a rare thing, what do you say?"
She added, "It has helped me a lot of a woman who was gratified elsewhere, who said that even she was crying when she was upset, but developed a technique that meant that when she was growing up and starting to cry, she would tell the person she was talking to, "It's probably thinking that she's sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he did not stop.
And I thought it was a brilliant thing."
Crying is allowed as a way to get out of his great anger partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of one of the first jobs I had, in an office dominated by men, where I once found myself crying with indescribable anger, was when an older woman caught me from my neckcrow - a cold manager who was always afraid of some of it - and carried me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know that you're angry.
They think you're sad and feel happy that they've been able to hurt you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Democratic Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was leaving for the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in a relationship outside of marriage on a boat known as Monkey Business and left the election, Ms. Schroeder, very close, concluded that there was no reason why she did not explore the idea of issuing herself for the presidential election.
"This was not a well-planned decision," she told me with a 30-year embrace.
"There were already seven other candidates who were going out for the election, and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called her "White Snow and the Seven Nani."
As this was at the end of the campaign, she was back in fundraising, and she therefore swore that she would not be out for election if she did not make $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who would give $1,000 to the men would only give her $250.
"These think I'm taking some discount?" she said.
When she made her speech in which she announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so excited - so grateful to the people who supported her, bound by the system which made it so difficult to raise funds and to target voters instead of delegates, and linked to sex - which was closed.
"I probably thought I had these strong brakes," reminded Ms. Schroeder about the way the media reacted to it.
"I thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my grave?
"Is she crying?"
How the US-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The numbers of trade-war opening air bombs between the United States and China were exacerbating, and while the struggle remained to end, a disagreement between countries could be beneficial for long-term Beijing, say experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, gave the first warning earlier this year by taxing the main Chinese exporters including solar panels, iron and aluminium.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting goods amounting to $200 billion (€150 billion), and effectively taxing all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has been retorted at the same time, while more recently it was presenting charges of five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has pledged to agree with the US every time, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will give up in the near future.
The fact that Washington takes a step back means that it accepts the requests, but publicly the fact that China surrenders to the US will be too embarrassing to Xi Ning, the Chinese president.
However, experts say that if Beijing works wisely, US trade war pressures can support China positively in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for starting an economic nightmare in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what the viewers previously recognised," said Abigail Grace, research partners focusing on Asia in the Center for New American Security, a reflection group.
Syria is "ready" to return the refugees, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria states that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees in the country which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
6 million more people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moalem said that the Syrian regime welcomes help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsoring the hearing.
Europe embraces Ryder Cup's victory in Paris
Team Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018 against Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Gulf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in a European land and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title again when the Danish captain Thomas Bojrn team reached the 14.5 points it needed to win the United States.
Phil Mikkelson who is prominent in the United States, who struggled throughout the entire tournament, gave his kulp in the water in the 16 par-3 hole, thereby surrendering his game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian molynari golfer has been outstanding in all his rounds, and has become 1 out of 4 players who have never brought 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Speth lost 5&4 against the player at least on the European team Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest-level player, Dustin Johnson, brought 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England who played in his final Ryder Cup.
An eight-Ryder Cups Veteran, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the best European tournament player ever, with 25.5 points throughout his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I couldn't hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he chose me and that he believed in me.
I'm very happy, very happy that I got back the cup.
The team is everything, and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia emotional after the European win.
He passes the torch to his co-contributor John Ram who won the United States golf legend Roger Woods 2&1 in singles play Sunday.
"The incredible pride that I feel, which I won for Roger Woods, when I was raised to follow him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a record of Ryder Cup 13-21-3 throughout his career.
Strange statistics of one of the best players ever, which has won 14 main titles, the second after Jack Niklaus only.
Team USA fought all the weekend to find those parts of the golf course with the exception of Patrick Red, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high caliber golf throughout the entire tournament.
The U.S. master Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his team, "I'm proud of these men, they fight.
There was a time this morning when we put some pressure on Europe.
We have argued.
To Thomas we take the hat.
He's a very good master.
His 12 players played very well.
We will join again, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
To these 12 young men I love and I am proud to be a master.
You have to grab your hat and head.
Play better than she."
