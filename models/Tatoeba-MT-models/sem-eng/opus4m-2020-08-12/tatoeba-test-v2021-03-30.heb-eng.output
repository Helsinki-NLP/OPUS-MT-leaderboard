I don't like seeing animal abuse.
Tom left the upper house before Mary's funeral.
One of the greatest mystery of life is how a cat decides what his next step is.
I ate the mustard we cooked a few days ago.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom jumped into the frozen water.
Are you sure there's no way?
Tom said he couldn't walk.
I'll wait down.
Of course she's sick.
The boat's turned upside down.
Maybe we should go and see Tom.
Now come trouble.
No one was still awake.
I'll remember you forever.
Tom was shocked.
I'll do your advice.
Tom bet on the wrong horse.
Please explain the rejection.
Thanks for paying attention.
We've been waiting for you for hours until you show up.
Tom wasn't the only one who got up so early this morning.
The road's too narrow for trucks.
We're in trouble.
How many students do you have at school?
It feels like it's the right thing.
Tom knows Mary's hiding something.
They all deserve to die.
I barely knew him.
Many animals that live thousands of years no longer exist.
Let's roll out.
Have you had a nice weekend?
Am I stupid?
She was depressed because of all her problems.
Are meals at cost?
Because the rain stopped. He went for a walk.
The doctor knew how to deal with an emergency like that.
The temperature's down 10 degrees.
I know this neighborhood.
She applied for a visa.
I thought it was all over.
It's dangerous to swim at night.
It's just like fighting wind safety.
I don't care about the risk.
It's the weather forecast time.
It looks hard.
That man's dangerous.
She cooked us a wonderful meal.
He was a soldier during the war.
I'm on the sea language.
It was my first thought.
We don't blame you.
We can't live without sleep as we can't live without food.
Someone just called.
They knew better days.
He lives out of his hand here.
If you don't hurry, you'll never get to the village.
We think the reason for his success was hard work.
I got tired of it.
Everything depends on your decision.
You're checking.
He was stuck in his mind. His hand supports his forehead.
There's not much to say.
Look, here he comes.
She was really cold.
It's on my list of assignments.
Be careful not to fall to scratch your knee.
I gave it to my mother.
Stop wasting time.
I felt pretty bad.
My hobby is reading.
I'll have my coffee after dinner.
I don't forgive you.
They don't believe you.
It wasn't supposed to happen.
I don't want to study tonight.
Tom thinks Mary made a bad mistake.
I always knew Tom was meant for greatness.
It's raining quietly.
Can you send this letter in quick mail?
Close it.
Tom's not responsible.
Hey, guys, I'm Tom, and I'm here with Mary.
You look beautiful tonight.
We experienced one problem with the talent yesterday.
Tom visited Mary on October 20th.
When I got home, I found your letter waiting for me.
They're Russians.
It's simpler than it looks.
She seems to me a real, reliable man.
Tom Ethelty.
He tried.
We can't survive without your help.
I was the one who suggested it.
This affair isn't as good as his last affair.
They stayed that way for a while.
This road is dangerous.
Can you show me the way to the library?
I stayed home all day and read books.
That's my decision.
It's okay.
I made him go.
Ask him to come watch a movie.
Tom was off the hook.
Don't worry about me. Don't listen to me. You know, your parents know me.
I know exactly how you feel.
I met Tom in January.
They made a joint decision about the divorce.
Stop bothering me.
Today I'm in the mood of Melanfoley.
It doesn't happen much.
We're planning on visiting Mr. Smith tomorrow.
He has a comfortable nature.
I never want to leave this place.
My son is my biggest headache.
Sit down, please!
I can't drive a car.
She invited each of us to ice cream.
She played the play.
Tom told me he hasn't seen Mary all day.
I don't like being alone on the beach.
I never plan anything.
Do you have a map?
Tom was sweating.
Do I have to sell this?
They're communicating by hand signs.
Maybe we should ask someone for help.
I'm hungry.
That's hard to read.
I've been cold for a week and I haven't recovered yet.
We started walking again right after she recovered.
Is there an English-Japanese hotel on the shelf?
The gun will settle.
We're too few now.
We have to stay alert.
What's the matter with Tom anyway?
They had a child.
Tom seems troubled.
Maybe Tom's telling the truth.
Civilization is now a threat to nuclear war.
I often have nightmares.
The company decided to hire two new secretary.
Please give me a pillow.
Tom almost killed both of them.
I wanted to watch this movie with you.
Come on at least six.
I'm turning away from your clues.
It's very intuitive.
I'll get it right back.
Tom and Mary are both miserable.
What group is your boyfriend on?
We'll just stay.
Sit down, please.
Tom decided to stay behind.
Please shut up.
Do you like what you see?
Give me a second chance.
It's natural.
Don't ever write the words "merc leve" and "marc carob" in German!
It's a violent neighborhood.
You'll be surprised what you can learn in a week.
There are animals that can feel a storm approaching.
How can I ever forgive Tom?
This house seems abandoned.
This is the perfect place for Marv.
Consult the doctor.
I'm jealous.
These are my friends.
She's in love with this kid.
Tom didn't finish all his homework.
How do you know about Tom?
You sound like a child.
I know you'd do the same to me.
In the fall, their color and their color are in short supply.
Tom never admits by mistake, because he thinks it's a sign of weakness.
That's how I like it.
She testified she didn't meet Maria.
It's the second river in its length in Japan.
No one's happy.
I don't finally owe anyone.
Tom spoke rudely.
He's married and father to two.
Could have been a failure in the answer.
He's squeezing his bike every week.
Don't turn the computer off.
From this distance, you can't tell.
She was instructed by her former doctor and transferred to another hospital.
I was a prankless.
My best friend speaks Irish.
It's more complicated than I thought at first.
I don't know anything about him.
I only had a few beers.
The man with the car is Mr. Jones.
I owe it to my friend.
I stayed calm.
She likes to try new things.
I heard him hang.
I moved on to the next page.
Did you become an angel?
I hope this can happen now.
Materials will come along.
Did I touch an exposed nerve?
There's a lot of fun in big cities.
The first hit is half the fight.
I'm not sure that, either.
I really saw a ghost.
You recovered from the shock?
Tell Tom I'm going for a drive.
It's all on its head.
Do you happen to know where she lives?
Tom and Mary are probably getting married one day.
Their house was on fire.
I love this picture.
Get some sleep.
Eventually, his dream came true.
I worked very hard.
Not so he's dead.
She couldn't answer the question.
The oranges are rich in vitamin C.
I'm sure Tom told you I'd be here.
This system has advantages and disadvantages.
He hid the fact that he expelled his wife.
Shut your big mouth.
Tom told Mary about his new car.
Who invented the dynamite?
You're the greatest love of my life.
Try bearing fruit.
Where's your money?
Tom asked Mary to sing harder.
Sorry, I can't stay long.
I don't know if it's high.
Where's the toothbrush?
Let's get something cold to drink.
It's my book.
I want a guitar like John has.
It won't bother us if you take pictures from the outside.
The goal is to sanctify the means.
You seem to have a lot of knowledge about it.
Do you support or resist abortion?
Please don't get involved in this.
Long Time No C.
Today I won't get an e-mail from anyone.
I've been waiting for you.
The cat's over his back.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Tom is from Boston.
You want to know how I did it?
I can't find the paper.
I'm learning one language.
This microscope increases itself a hundred times.
He's in debt.
Tom's sharp.
Tom's not the one who left the party early.
Speaking English in Canada?
That's really impressive!
We wanted dessert.
Tom didn't get up early enough.
Hello, how can I help you?
Tom pointed his gun at the target.
I believe my friends are growing horns for me.
You better leave.
Donald Trump suffers from dementia.
Please don't ask.
I'm coming to kill you.
I like the time between the Arabs.
You should go.
You ready to go out?
I know how that must sound.
Can anyone help me out here?
Where was Tom thrown into prison?
I've learned from the best.
Don't be quick to protect me.
I only know that.
Don't ignore me again.
Construction area: Use protective helmets.
It's Tom's closet.
I'm sure I won't recommend Tom for the job.
You should try not to forget what time it is.
Will you go to the United States next year?
Think about your future.
As far as I'm concerned, I don't trust him at all.
I don't know what to say.
It was raining yesterday.
She was caught with her pants down.
I know maybe you think I'm too young.
I can't help him.
It didn't go that far.
How's everybody feeling?
We're supposed to be safe here.
Have you had breakfast today?
There's a bridge a mile up the river.
Tom suggested Mary don't do that.
I know you think there's no hope.
The judges have made a decision.
Hard to learn Greek?
He's going to the library to read books.
They're animals in this city.
The sky will be clear soon.
I didn't like Tom.
We're trying to learn here.
Please, adopt this dog pup.
It's impossible to provide it.
Go back to your chair.
She chose a hat that would fit her new dress.
I spent the last Sunday off at home.
Let's not do anything that might upset Tom.
I'm short of money.
I'll finish reading that novel soon.
Tom doesn't seem interested in what's going on.
I don't want you to see my daughter anymore.
You guys don't go out there.
Tom drinks about three gallons of water a day.
We'll never agree.
We were glad we were alive.
Some newspapers have blinded the news.
Please sign this.
That's my car.
I'd love to see that.
This pen is the best.
It's a dangerous thing to admire heroes.
Tom says he doesn't want to talk about it anymore.

Salt, please.
Did you decide where you'd eat lunch?
I changed my theory.
She was kind enough to pick me up from the house.
I ran.
Tom's an accountant.
Pick up your left hand.
I doubt the accuracy of his statement.
I think they've had a problem.
This movie's boring.
Where to go and what to see were my main concerns.
My longest romantic relationship lasted four months.
She's never told me yet.
To the end of an old hat hat that he always wears in the rain.
Take your stuff and go.
You just like to do bad to people, don't you?
We need a lot of people there.
You can agree or not, but I don't change the price.
