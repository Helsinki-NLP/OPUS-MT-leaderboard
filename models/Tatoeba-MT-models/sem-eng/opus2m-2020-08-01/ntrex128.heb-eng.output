Members of parliament in Wales are afraid to look like friends.
Some members of parliament were alarmed by the proposal that their title would change from AMs to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This fear arose following plans to change the name of the house of laws to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of parliament all over the political rainbow are worried that this will invite a joke.
One member of parliament from the Libre Party said his men were afraid that "it'll be out with Twp and Pwp."
For the name outside Wales: in the Volshite, twp means stupid and--pwp means puke.
A member of the Parliament of the Feld Cumery Party said that all his friends were "unwelcome" and offered alternatives.
A member of the Welsh conservative Party said that his friends were "open to proposals" about the change of name, but said that the name MWP (the initials of the Wulsh Parliamentman) sounded very similar to the word Muppet.
In this context, the WW signal is expressed in a similar way to the form of the letter and in English in the Yoshier accent.
The Legislative Committee, which is currently drafting legislation for changes in names, said: "The final decision on every word describing the names of the members of the legislature is, of course, the decision of the members of the legislature themselves."
The Wills Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh legislature the authority to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which gave extensive support to the change of the name of the Parliament of the Welsh Parliament.
As for the function title of the members of parliament (AMs), the Commission recommended that members of the Welsh Parliament ' or the heads of the WMPs, but the MWP option received most of its support in public consultation.
Members of Parliament offer alternative options, but the struggle to achieve Concensus can cause quite a bit of headache to the board president, Ellen Jones, who is supposed to present a draft of legislation on changes in the coming weeks.
The legislation on reforms includes other changes in the functioning of the legislature, including rules for the removal of members of the parliament and the structure of the committee system.
The vote of the members of the parliament is that you will eventually determine their title of office during the legislative proceedings.
Citizens of Macedonia are going to make a wish with a change in the name of the country.
On Sunday, citizens will vote on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The people's question was determined in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, where there is a district called Macedonia.
Greece has claimed for a long time that its north name is in the context of a claim to the territory of Greece and its return and its opposition to the test of Macedonia to join the European Union and NATO.
President George Ivanov of Macedonia, who objected to the people's question about the change of name, said that he would ignore its consequences.
However, those who support the people's wish, including Prime Minister Zoran Zav, claim that the change of name is just the price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are still present at the church's challenges in Harlem's neighborhood
According to Mr. Adams, "the old neighborhood says there was a bar and a church in every corner."
"There are no bars and no churches today."
According to him, it's possible to understand the disappearance of bars.
"People's company lives today are running differently," he said.
"Beers are no longer the neighborhood living room where people visit on a regular basis."
As for churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of property will not survive for as long as the heads of the churches expect, "and sooner or later, they will find themselves again at the beginning."
He says that the churches will take up apartment buildings with common homes that inhabit people who are not of the kind who help the neighborhood to maintain a unique character.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he says, "and thus the closure of these churches is unlikely for most of the people who moved to these apartments to join these churches."
Two churches were built by congregations that believed to build, before Harlem became a predominantly black neighborhood — the Community Metropolitan Church in 1870, and St. Martin in 10 years later.
The white Buddhist community left in the late 1930s.
A black believer community that worked in the area became the owner of the building.
The Church of St. Martin passed into the hands of a black - believing community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was the leader of the 125th Street Merchant, a central shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
It burned down in 1939, causing serious damage to the structure, but as part of the plans of the believers under Pastor Johnson to rebuild it, they invited the construction of the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson the Father and who inherited his place in the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the title “The Bells of the Poor. ”
The expert who played the July Yearbook called it "cultural treasure" and "historic tool without replacement".
The expert, Tiffany Ing, from Michigan University, also mentioned this as the world's first bell caller to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who later played the bigger part of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Mariwia'r said that St. Martin's church didn't replace him.
What happened at St. Martin's Church over the last few months was a complex story of architects and contractors, some of which were brought by local church leaders, and others by the Epicipalian Fathers.
The meeting — the governing body of the congregation of believers made up of local believers — wrote to the churches in July, explaining her concern that the bishops would “seek to roll the costs ” to the meeting, although the meeting was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors who sent the apostles.
Some of those who believed complained about the absence of authority.
13-year-old wound shark in the sound of catching lobsters
A 13-day-old shark attacked and wounded a 13-day-old boy while the boy dived to catch lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, giving out official causes.
The attack occurred shortly before 7:00 a.m. near the shore of Bekon in Assinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV network in San Diego that he was crawling with friends of that about an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy scream for help and then ran over there with a team to help feed him to the beach.
Hammel originally thought that only the enthusiastically shouting at Lobster's grip, but then he realized that the boy was screaming: “I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he saw that "his whole smuggling bone had been recovered."
"I yelled at everyone out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!"
The boy was headed to the Radi Hospital in San Diego where he was defined as a human being.
Not known which species of shark attacked the boy.
Rescue chief Larry Giles said in a press briefing that a shark was identified in the area a few weeks earlier, but we'll determine that it's not a dangerous food shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the body.
The authorities have closed access to the coast between Ponto Caszad and Suami Bay in Asynatas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbory's planning to enter the UK's beauty product market.
Sainsbory's starts a competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and opens a dog store-type passage with professional women.
As part of a significant initiative to penetrate the UK's beautiful product market, which rolls 2.8 billion starling a year, and as sales in fashion and products for a drop-off house continue to grow, the vast passage of the beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if the experiment succeeds, additional stores will be added next year.
The investment in beautiful products comes at a time when gossipers pick up ways to use a spectrum area that was previously captured by TVs, microwave devices and homemade products.
Sainsbory's stated that the company is expected to double its performance of its beautiful products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, for the first time in its history.
The existing product lines of the L'Orial, Maybelline and Burt's Bees companies will also get to another area with a given brand areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The network of gossipers also resets its makeup line - Botique - so that most products are friendly to vegans, a feature that demands it to grow in young buyers.
Also, Fragrance Shop will check for concessions at the two Sainsbory's stores, the first of which was opened in Croyden, south of London, last week and the second one will be opened in Sly Oak, Birmingham, at a later date this year.
Buying online and buying too little food every day in local comfort stores obliges gossipers to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Cash, CEO of Sainsbory's, said that the branches would become more dolls for dogs while the gossip network was trying to fight against the cheap Aldi and Lidl networks with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbory's added Argos' sales points in hundreds of stores as well as several habitat points since she bought both networks two years ago, additions that have increased the sales of the supplies and made the purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts of the network to revive the share of the beauty products and its pharmaceuticals have ended in failure.
Sainsbory's tried a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the communication ended after a dispute about how to split the proceeds from the pharmaceuticals into the junkie.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbory's sold the business of the 281 Celesio pharmaceuticals, owner of the Loyds pharmaceutical network for 125 million starling three years ago.
She said Lloyds would play a role in the program, by expanding the branded performance of leather-farming products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
The business manager of Sainsbory's, Paul Mills-Hicks said: "We've made a reverse in the mirror and the sense of our beautiful product passage, to improve the environment for the customers.
In addition, we invested in specially qualified workers and would be able to offer advice instead.
Our branded performance is designed to fit every need and our ongoing environment and resting locations make us an attractive target for the acquisition of beautiful products, challenging the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is angry after Holly Willaby canceled a 11 million-dollaring deal.
The TV show star Dragons Den, Peter Jones, expressed anger after the TV show Holly Willavi canceled a 11 million-million-star deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new strings with Mark And Spencer and ITV.
Actually, Willavi doesn't have time to brand his house clothes and their props.
The two's common business is similar to the Goop brand of actress Guineth Paltro.
The 37-year-old This Morning show announced her departure at Post in Astgram.
Holly Willaby left the planet Dragons Den Peter Jones angry that she had recently cancelled her participation in the prestigious lifestyle brand of the two to focus on her oil reserves with Mark And Spencer and ITV.
Sources reported that 'Nes responded 'with rage' when the TV star announced during a storm meeting on Tuesday in the main offices of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckingham, that because of its new deals - up to 1.5 starling - she didn't have enough time to dedicate herself to the dresses of the house and their hideouts Truly.
The two's joint business was similar to the Goop brand of actress Guineth Paltro and was expected to double the fortune of Willavi, which was studied at 11 million trollings.
While a 37-year-old Willaby posted in Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones was on a British flight to one of his refugee homes.
According to one source: "Truly was undoubtedly the top priority of Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would provide her with income in the coming decades.
A decision to leave completely surprised all involved.
No one could have believed what happened on Tuesday. It was so close to a silence.
"Marlo's warehouses are full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that leaving This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, may cost society millions of dollars as a result of massive investments in various products, from addictions and candles to household clothes, and potential for further delays in the launch.
And it might bring a long-term friendship to an end.
Willaby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
Willaby set up Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the company's head in March.
The couple spent vacations together and Jones owns 40% at the Baldwin TV production company.
Willabi will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Annette McPherlin as an accessor of ITV's I'm A Celbrity program.
A close source to Jones said last night: “We don't respond to his business affairs. ”

He joked about the criticism he had received from the news press about statements that some defined as "not presidential" and that he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
He said Trump in the voice of "News presenter."
"I didn't make any turnout."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in a second meeting after commending their first meeting in June as a major step in the direction of nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
But the negotiation of a nuclear weapon was frozen.
More than three months after the June summit meeting in Singapore, the top diplomat from North Korea, Ri Young Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a response from the United States to the initial disarmament steps of North Korea.
Instead, according to him, the United States continues with sanctions designed to continue the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view of his speech in custody.
"We're in great shape with North Korea," he said.
"We've almost gone to war against North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim brought positive results -- the cessation of missile experiments, the release of prisoners and the return of the remains of American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his extraordinary approach to speaking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full stadium, we had about 200 people standing there," said Trump when he pointed right in front of him.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island and killed hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Luxembourg, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that there was no need for their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lomboc population lost their homes, no national disaster was announced, which is conditional on international relief.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so that's a little challenging," said Mrs. Sombong.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palo, it is not yet clear if foreign missionaries can move in the field.
Mr. Sotopo, the spokesman for the Agency for National Disasters, said that Indonesian authorities were engaged in assessing the situation in Palo to see if there was more to international services to contribute to the relief effort.
In view of the unprecedented earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unfortunately ill prepared for natural disasters.
While Tsunami shelters were built in Acea County, they are rare in other coastal areas.
The obvious lack of alarms is likely a warning of tsunamis in Pallo, although there is a warning, has resulted in loss of soul.
Even in the best of times, travel between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complex.
A hospital ship that protected Lombobok to treat the victims of an earthquake, makes its way to Palo, but it'll take her at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
The improvement of Indonesia’s poor infrastructure was at the heart of President Woko and Vidodo’s campaign, and he invested a lot of money in roads and railways.
But Mr. G. Wukko stood in front of funding for his re-election next year.
Mr. Woko also faced pressure from continuing class breakdowns in Indonesia as a result of the religious radicalization of the majority of Muslims in the country.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes in wars between Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets, using knives, bows and arrows and other household weapons.
Video: Daniel Stridge from the Librelli group is finally compared to Lacey.
Daniel Streig's rescued content from the loss of Lessy Farmer League with a gate on the 89th Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Stridge got a delivery from Chardan Shakry when he was about 30 feet from Chesie's gate and his team in closure 1-0.
He jumped the ball to his left and then turned a kick to the far corner.
The ball flew up and down to the top right of the network.
Eventually, the ball landed over the cave of Capa Arevaslagga that jumped into it and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get to this position, get to the ball and actors like Shack always playing forward as far as possible, so I was just trying to create myself as much time as possible," said Sridge on the RiverpoolFC.com website.
"I saw Canta and I made one touch and I didn't think about it too much and I just kicked."
Lacey led 0-1 in the half after the Belgian star Aden-Zar carried a gate on the 25th minute.
The blue pioneer transferred a pass back to Matthew Kobachch in the same game, before he turned close to the middle of the field and ran quickly into the half-field of Liverpool.
Kubachch's been doing a quick maneuver and going in the middle of the field.
And then he kicked a beautiful, cross-blown kick, which led the azar into the space.
The azar ran the defense and ended with the ball inside the upper right corner of the gate, with a left kick passing the Liberpole Allison beef player.
Lybpol will face Napolé on the fourth day at 15:00 at the San Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Lacey will face the video in the European League of Oppa on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Where the deaths in the canon in Indonesia went to 832
From where the killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia went to 832, the State Disaster Agency was informed on Sunday morning.
Many people were reported to be trapped in the destruction of buildings that had collapsed in the 7.5 earthquake, which occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 10 feet [6 m] high, said the agency's speaker Sotopo Forvo was at a press conference.
The city of Palo, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was drunk in the ruins of damaged buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The police opened up a murder investigation after a woman's body was found in Biancand this morning, Marsaid.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. on John Street when her body was stabbed, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police are calling people from the area who have seen or heard something to turn to.
Detective Detective Brian O'Hagan says: “The investigation is at the beginning, but I would like to force everyone who was near John Street in Birkent to see or hear something suspicious, to approach us.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially cab drivers, who may have taken something in a car camera, to approach us -- because the photographs may include information that is vital to our investigation."
A police officer confirmed that the woman's body was found living in Birkend and that she was found inside a building.
At the scene this afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came by to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigations continue while the police have announced that they are now in the process of delivering messages to relatives.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mewes just tried to get into his apartment, but he was told that the police stopped anyone from entering or leaving the building.
He was shocked when she found out what happened.
The tenants are now told to spend more hours until they get back to their apartments.
A cop sounds like telling one person that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman looked at the scene when she was tearing.
She's coming back and whining "That's terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police trucks were waiting inside the castle, and another one went out.
A number of cops were standing inside the scene when they were targeting people in the apartment building.
Anyone in whose possession information is requested to send a direct message on Twitter to @MerPollCC, dial 101 or call Crimestoppers on the phone to 111,555,800 and indicate the date of September 30, 247.
Cromwell's statue became the next target for memory attacks in the struggle around the historical era.
The statue will be a poetic justice in the light of the Thai typology that has been performed by the Portuguese supporters of so many cultural and religious art objects in England.
But the Cromwell Society claims that Mr. Crick's suggestion is "fool" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is impossible that the current controversy over the removal of images, the character of Oliver Cromwell, who is outside Westminster's palace, would become a target.
The destruction of the statues of the civil wars in England was not carried out at Cromwell's command and was not carried out by him.
The wrong Cromwell may have fallen victim to the actions of one of his predecessors in the capital, Thomas Cromwell, in the century before.
The impressive representation of Cromwell in the hands of Sir William Hamu Thornecroft is evidence of a 19th-century and part of the historical history of many who still think it is still worthy of her respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was captured by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as he defended the parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the King.
The question whether this is an entirely accurate assessment is a matter of ongoing historical controversy.
An unprovoked fact is that the struggle in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the development of our nation further, and Cromwell is one identified figure representing one side of the corn at the time.
His achievements as the protector Lord "are also worthy of honor and triumph."
A deadly pig that drove a Chinese farmer to death.
Local media sources report that a pig attacks a farmer's death on the market in southwestern China.
The man, who was identified as his "Yuan" family, was found dead with a gravel artery while he was covered with blood adjacent to the Pigs' Department at the Loupensaway Market in Guighow County, so the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A farmer prepares to inject a pig-farm vaccine on May 30, 2005, in Shininging in Chenghai County, China.
According to reports, on Wednesday he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yoonan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next day his cousin found him dead, and he found a door to a pighouse near the open.
He said Deir found a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A criminal investigation confirmed that the pig weighing 250 pounds had attacked the farmer, according to the report.
"My uncle's legs were full of blood and error", told his cousin who named his family Wu, as quoted in Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market on Thursday morning at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man did not belong to Joan or his cousin.
Market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked behind bars and running to prevent him from attacking other people, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
It was said that there was negotiations between Yuan's family and the market authorities about compensation for his death.
Although the phenomenon is rare, cases of swine attacks have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused a man to have human injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had a farmer's bracelet in Wales to his tractor until the farmer's wife had escaped the animal.
After a farmer in organon was caught by his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Utah told CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but the taste of blood may be "trigger".
They're just playing.
They're like naughty, very curious kids... They're not gonna hurt you.
We just have to give them the proper amount of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rains in large areas of the southwestern United States.
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa's storm is weakening as it moves above the colder waters on the North Coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
However, the storm Rosa will bring me a floating wave all over North Mexico and Southwest the United States over the next few days.
The winds of the Rosa storm reached a speed of 135 km/h, i.e. Hurricane storm level 1, and right for the first day at 5:00 a.m. according to the east coast clock, the storm centre was located about 620 miles south-east of Punta Eugena, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
In the meantime, an eczema is being created over the Pacific Ocean, which is heading east toward the East Coast of the United States, and with the approaching of the island in the western part of California on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will start pushing a deep tropical heat north into the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 milligrams of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, tropical moisture will be combined with the nearness of heavy rains in vast areas of the south-west of the United States over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 100 millimetres of rain will result in a flood of lightning and endangering the desert's landfalls.
Deep tropical moisture will cause the rain to reach 50 to 75 mm an hour at different points, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Rains in amounts of 50 to 100 metres are expected in parts of the Southwest of the United States, especially in Arizona.
Inflations may be possible with conditions that rapidly deteriorate due to the spreading nature of the tropical rain.
It is highly recommended to avoid walking for long distances in the desert when there is danger of a tropical rain.
A heavy rain could turn canyons into starving rivers and storms, bringing strong winds of winds and dust floods.
The nearest package will bring local rains to parts of the South California coast.
A total of over 13 millimetres of rain can be recovered, which could cause waste and passageways.
It'll be the first rain in this rainy season.
Sponge tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday night and on the morning of Monday, and the rain will be strong and spread on Monday and Tuesday.
A heavy rain will spread to four corners on Tuesday and last on Wednesday.
In October, there may be sharp temperature changes across the United States, while the Arctic is cooling, but the tropical area remains quite warm.
This situation sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature between short distances.
On Sunday there's an excellent example of extreme temperature changes across the U.S. Central.
There's a 10-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Ummaha, Nebraska and St. Louis Lavine, Iva.
In the next few days, a long-term summer heat will try to grow and expand again.
At the beginning of October the temperatures will be warm in most central and eastern regions of the United States, moving between 27 and 31 degrees from the south and the north-east.
In New York City the temperature may reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term weather forecast shows high likely temperatures above the average in the East of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have been watching the hearing of Burt Kavano.
Over 20 million people watched on Thursday, on the six television networks, the fascinating testimony of the Supreme Court candidate, Bert Kuano, and the woman who accused him of sexual assault reportedly in the 1980s, Christine Blazy Ford.
Meanwhile, the political debate continued, with news coming out in the middle of the usual broadcasts to announce a surprising development on Friday: an agreement expanded by Senator Marizona Jeff F. F. F.
Ford told the Senate Legal Committee that she's 100% sure that Kavano's slams her body when he's drunk and tries to raid her during a high school party.
Kavano, collapsing testimony, said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
The number of viewers was probably even higher than the 20.4 million viewers reported by the Nilsen scale.
Nilsen checked the average observation on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC networks.
The data were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Box Business Network.
And Nelson usually finds it hard to measure people watching in the offices.
For comparison, it's about a crowd watching on a scale similar to that of a football or Oscar ceremony game.
According to Nilsen data, Fox News Channel, a very enthusiastic supporter of Kawano's appointment, led to all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day.
ABC stands second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN reported 2.52 million.
The level of interest remains high after the hearing.
Senator Flick was the main figure in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the office of the Mt. Republican Senator issued a message that he would vote in favour of the appointment of Kavano, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras while a group of protestors were yelling at him as he was trying to enter the elevator to get to the hearing on the Legal Committee.
He's been looking down for a few minutes while the protesters were staring at him, when all of this was filmed live on CNN.
"I'm standing here before you," said one of the women.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are helpless."
Flick said that the survivor posted a message and said, before the elevator door closed, he'd say more things at the committee hearing.
Radio and cable networks were all broadcast for several hours later, when the Legal Committee was about to point out the appointment of Kavannu to vote in the Senate.
But Felix said he'd vote in favour of the appointment only on condition that you get an understanding of the F.B.I.'s going to investigate the charges against the candidate over the next week, which was required by the members of the Democratic minority.
Felix was partly convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Cons.
After a conversation with Cons and several senators, Felix took his decision.
Felix's decision had power, because it was clear that Republicans would not have the majority to confirm the appointment of Kavanno without investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavannu.
Head of the British government, Teresa May, accused her visits to politics on the subject of Brczeit.
Prime Minister Teresa May blamed her seniors for leaving the European Union that they were playing in politics with a future of Britain and hit on the national Internet, an interview that she gave to the Sunday Times.
The Prime Minister of Britain, Teresa May, is coming to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview that took place alongside her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her plan of action for Brczeit, saying that the offer that Britain and the European Union would take over this property of this one is "completely dissipated".
The police arrested Dayton Simpson as a suspect in the murder of the LSU player.
The police arrested a suspect at the deadly shooting in Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played in the LSU group.
A 20-year-old man named Diton Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for murder in the first degree, so he was informed by the Baton Rog Police.
Officials have published a video of the Sims-Simpson conflict, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said that Simpson's DNA was on them, according to a WAFB network report, which is part of the CBS network.
After the Simpson investigation, according to the police, he admitted that he had shot Wade to death.
The bail fee was set at $350,000, as reported in Advocate.
The pathological institute of East Baton Rose's department published an initial report on Friday, according to which the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and the neck.
The police gave credit to the Task Force for the capture of fugitive criminals in the state police, the state police's criminal lab, the Southern University police and citizens in the area who assisted in the investigation that led to the capture of the suspect.
The Department of Ethics of the University of LSU, Joe Alva, acknowledged to the law enforcement authorities of the area that “hereliness and the pursuit of justice”.
Sims was 20.
The four-footed Forward basketballer grew up in Baton Rose, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the University of LSU.
His average last season is 5.6 points and 2.6 bullets are coming back.
Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "freaky" and "banging" from Wade's death.
"That's the thing I'm afraid of all the time," said Wade.
Mt. Pulse ash on Mexico City
The ash that swooped out at the end of the Popocectal volcano came to the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned the people of Mexico on Saturday to move away from the volcano after the activity in the mountain was full of men and recorded 183 gas and ashes over 24 hours.
At the center of Notro's, there's a number of noises and tremors.
Social media images showed layers of ash cover on the floors of cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Socimelco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, which is 70 miles (45 miles) south-east of the capital, since an earthquake with a power of 7.1 reached the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Guéhene, has been active since 1994.
A conflict between the police and the Catalan alone near the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent protestors clashed with forces of police to spread demonstrations, and thousands of others joined the protest against the first anniversary of the party's vote on Catalonia's independence.
A group of masked beads that the cops were misguide to protest, threw eggs at the cops and poured out paint powder, creating black dust clouds on the streets, which are usually hit by the rivers.
Conflicts also broke out later that day when police had to use machines to get over the protestors.
For a number of hours, independent groups of supporters, who sang, “We will not forget, will not forgive” in front of those who supported the unity of Spain.
In the local press, 14 people were reported to have received treatment for minor injuries sustained by the demonstrators.
The tension remained high in the independent regions a year after the people's question, which was held on October 1, was tried by the Spanish government, but celebrated by the pro-independence Catalans.
The voters chose to become an independent country with a large majority vote, although the voting held was low when those who objected to breaking up largely rejected the vote.
Government authorities in Catalonia reported that almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the voting on cards across the area from violent conflicts.
Independence support groups set up camps to sleep on Friday night to prevent the demonstration of support at the National Police.
The demonstration took place but had to run a different course.
Narcisse Thrams, a 68-year-old electrician who was involved in the conflict of differences with his wife, said he had lost hope of becoming an independent Catalonia.
Last year we had our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy about being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they won an important victory, in the elections of last December, they had difficulty maintaining the theme of the year when many of their most well - known leaders lived in exile or in prisons awaiting trial for their part in the organization of the people’s question and in its aftermath, which declared independence.
Juan Foyg, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police support demonstration in his phone device, said that the fight was fought by politicians on both sides of the Mars.
"It's getting worse," he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Yonkers, one of the nine deadly leaders who have been in prison on trial since last year, announced that he would run the election to the European Parliament next year.
“To stand as a stand for European elections is the best way to depose democracy in democratic values and the oppression we have witnessed from the Spanish government, ” he says.
Lundondri: A number of men were arrested after the car ran into the house.
Three men - aged 33, 34 and 39 - were arrested after a car hit the house in London.
The event took place on Thursday, about 19:30, at the British clock.
Detective Bob Bellmings said there was damage to the gates and to the building itself.
At some point, too, a sharp arrow was fired into the car.
Manga's kick gives Livingstone a 1-0 win on Rangers.
Dolly Manga's first gate to Livingstone promised the victory
Livingstone, who had just gone up to the league, shocked Ring'ers and the Stephen's trainer, which was just his second loss in 18 games as the director of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Manga's kick meant a lot because Gary Holt's team moved a level with Hibernian in the second place.
Jarar's team is left without a win outside the upper league house, and you will face the leader Harts, behind which she misses eight points, on the following Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will host Rafid Vienna on the European League Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston prolongs the missing sequence of home for six games, and Chief Holt hasn't experienced a break since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone missed opportunities in front of a weak host group.
Holt's group was supposed to lead long before they wore a gate, when their directity caused Rangers to have different problems.
Scott Robinson broke in front of but dragged his experiments ahead of a gate, and then Alan Leigh could focus his efforts only further after he slipped in to meet Craig Hellett's tone before the gate.
The hosts were willing to allow Ranger to play before them, knowing that they could make it difficult for the host group to kick free.
And that was the way the gate was turned on.
Herring's got a free kick, and Livingston created an opening, Daklan Gallagher and Robinson joined in blocking Manga, which made contact with and carried out a gate from the center of expansion.
At this point, Herring's controlled the holding of the ball but discovered that the house defenses were inconclusive, and the gate of Liam Kelly was almost unprovoked.
This pattern went on to the second half, although Alfredo Morlos did have to save Kelly the gate.
Scott Pittnam was shot by Rangers' spies.
Cross-balls continued to enter the range of Livingston, while two penalty pills -- after a breach of the lact on the replacement Glen Middleton, and one on hand-to-hand -- were removed.
Mlwingston - O.R.
Alstyre Lamont, BBC Scotland at Tony McCarney Stadium.
An amazing game and an amazing result from Livingstone.
All the players were excellent, and they kept up with expectations in this move.
Their game style and the despair of the players have almost never changed since they returned to the leading position, but they have to give a lot of credit for the way he's upset the team since he arrived.
He had so many stars.
Captain Hollett was awesome, leading to a remarkablely organized defense, while Manga kept Connor Goldson and Jo Waral on high ground all along the way.
Herring's, however, were inspirationless.
Although they were sometimes pretty good under Jarar, they did not live up to those standards.
They were missing the final ball -- only once they opened the defense of the home team -- and this was a red shot to the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the field.
Embarrassed reception of Ardwan Callen
There were blue smiles and sky when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on Saturday (September 29) for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdoan's controversial visit to Germany -- the purpose of which was to repair relations between the two member states of NATO.
They were interested in such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and the acceptance by Turkey of the European Union.
That's where Ardwan continued to participate in the opening of a new huge mosque.
Callen is the city with the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police announced security reasons for blocking 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters cooperated closely to see their president.
Hundreds of opposers of Erdoan — many of whom have heard their voice — protest against the policy lines of Erdovan and Germany’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The opposing protestors reflect the dispute around the guest that some Turks in Germany praise as a hero and others defend him as a fan.
A car accident in Deftford: a bike driver killed in a car collision.
A bike rider was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision took place near the street crossings in Studwood and Evelyn, a busy road in Deftford, southeastern of the city, about 10:15 a.m. by Britain's clock.
The driver stopped and the officers took care of the wounded, but the man died instead.
The collision came after another biker was killed in a hit-and-run on Childer Street, about a mile from the scene on Saturday.
The city police said that cops were trying to identify the killing and let his family know.
Instead of placing barriers and buses on alternative roads, drivers are advised to avoid the area.

And last October, the VPs were called to prison to deal with a serious riot where guards were attacked by snoker sticks.
The Hurricane Rosa threatens to drown in the Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It's rare that a tropical sink hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's expected to happen at the beginning of next week, when the remnants of the hurricane Rosa are going to cross the desert in the south-east and bring with them a danger to the rise.
The National Weather Service has already declared a threat to the emergence of lightning on Mondays and Tuesdays for Western Arizona into southeastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The storm is expected to travel straight over Phoenix on Tuesday, and close to Monday with the rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix posted on Twitter that only ten tropical silicones remained in the status of a tropical storm or a tropical sink within a distance of 322 km since 1950!
There was a hurricane of 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the Arizona hurricane centre are watching 50 to 100 millimetres of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 millimetres on the outskirts of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, including the main Rocky and the Big Garden, are expected to receive 25 to 50 km, with a possibility for isolated locations to be received within 50 km.
For those outside the area there is a danger of flashing, the rain of a Rosa storm may be a blessing because the area has suffered greatly.
Although flooding is a serious danger, some of these rains will help because the southwestern region is currently subject to conditions.
According to U.S. form surveillance, over 40% of Arizona is in a very difficult form, which is the second category in its material form, so a Wather.com website has been reported.
First of all, a route of a Rosa storm will reach the mainland across the island at the California Community in Mexico.
Rosa storm, still in the power of the hurricane on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, is 620 miles south of Punta Eugena, Mexico, and has moved north at a speed of about 20 km/h.
The storm hit colder in the Pacific, thus weakening.
So she is expected to reach the land in Mexico by the power of a tropical storm in the afternoon or the evening of Monday.
Rains across parts of Mexico may be heavy and cause severe flooding.
"Inclusive amounts of 75 to 150 m are expected from Bhaba California to Northwest Sonora, with a chance to reach 250 m", reports the Weather.com website.
Then a Rosa storm will continue into Mexico with a tropical cash before you reach the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical ground, so it will continue across Arizona into South Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger to be expected from the Rosa or its remains is heavy rains in Bhala California, Southwest Sonora, and Southwest desert in the United States," the message of the National Center for the hurricane.
These rains are expected to cause lightning and to cause life - threatening rivers to flow in the desert, and to cause landslides in the mountainous regions.

"The vote in favour of Judge Quano is to reject the rudeness of the spirit and shocking tactics of the democratic party," said Trump in a stop in Welling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavano has been "suffering the crimes, the anger" of the democratic party throughout his appointment process.
Kavannu testified to Congress on Thursday, denying emotionally and emotionally the accusation of Christine Blazy Ford that he had sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified in the hearing about her charge.
The president said on Saturday that "The people of the United States saw the brilliant, the quality and the courage" of Kavanno that day.
"The vote to confirm the appointment of Judge Kavano is a vote to confirm the appointment of one of the most distinguished legal minds of our time, a man with an excellent record of public service", he told his supporters audience in West Virginia.
The President took note of Kavannu's appointment when he spoke of the importance that Republicans would have to vote for the mid-priestly elections.

Hundreds of dead in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number is rising.
At least 384 people were killed, many of them were carried off by huge waves that collapsed on the shores, when a severe earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Solawsi, thus reporting official sources on Saturday.
A lot of people gathered for a beach festival in Palo City on Friday, when waves that were seen at a height of 6 feet (18 feet) crashed on the beach at sunset, swept many to their death and destroyed everything in their way.
The tsunami occurred following a 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat woke up yesterday, people still worked their affairs on the beach and didn't immediately escape, and they fell victim," said Sotopo Forvo Noroho, a spokesman for the BNPB disaster management agency, in the instruction in 'Akata.
He did not come by himself, he dragged cars, logs, houses, he hit everything on the ground, said Noroho, adding that the canoes moved on to the open sea at a speed of 800 miles (497 miles per hour) before hitting the shoreline.
Some of the people flew on trees to escape from the cane and they survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people turned to 24 centers in Pallo.
Air photographs released by the Disaster Agency showed destruction to a large number of homes and shops, weakened bridges and courses and a mosque surrounded by water.
Every year, a concussion continued to disturb the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquake series kills in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The BPPT in Indonesia stated that the energy released by the earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on it during World War II.
According to him, the city's geography, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Norroho described the destruction as "vast" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
Some victims' bodies were caught under the debris of damaged buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Norroho said that the number of deaths and damage could be greater along North Palo with a 300-mile-mile shoreline, an area called Dongla, and closer to the earthquake area.
The media, "Crushed completely and with no information" from Dungale, said Noroho.
The Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its people and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy now, but it could get much worse," he said.
On Saturday there was a lot of criticism of the agency for not having announced that a tsunami had hit Pallo, although official agents said that the waves had arrived while the warning was published.
In a video video on social networks, you can see a man on a high roof of a building screaming hysterical warnings about the tsunami approaching people on the street below.
In minutes, a wall of water crashs on the beach, carrying buildings and cars.
The News Agency did not immediately make sure that the photo was authentic.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused extensive power cuts that cut off the communications around Palo and made it difficult for the authorities to adapt to the rescue efforts.
The army began to send transport planes with assistance from Jakarta and other caves, according to authorities, but survivors still desperately need food and other essential supplies.
The city airport was only opened for aid efforts and remained closed until October.
President Woko and his unit were scheduled to visit the rescue centers in Pallo on Sunday.
From the point of view of the deaths in the canon of Indonesia, it has risen to over 800.
It's very difficult.
While the people of the World Vision Canada arrived safely in the city of Palo, where shelter workers made up of a tarpaulin set up in the yard of their offices, they passed through scenes of destruction on their way, said Mr. Dusba.
"They told me they saw many homes destroyed," he said.
It's very difficult.
Even while relief teams were beginning the unfortunate move of relief workers, they were complaining that they had not reached the Fall of experienced foreign relief workers.
According to Indonesia's regulations, funding, supplies and people from other countries can only begin to return if the affected area is designated as a national disaster zone.
This thing hasn't been done yet.
"It's still defined as a district-level disaster," said Olya Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government says "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can open the door to international assistance, but this status has not yet been announced."
When the second night fell on Palo after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, friends and family of missing persons were held in hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that light up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy swipes from the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescue men rescued a woman buried under the debris for two days, with her body on her side.
GANDONON SOVANDONO, coach of Indonesia's Assemblies Team, trained two missing crew parachutes to Asian games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others understand those who are trapped in a visual hotel, including Mr. Mendge, who were his disciples.
I'm carrying my own emotional burden, he said.
Mr. Ghandon recalled how in the hours after the news of a hotel collapse, he saw a widespread community of storm droprs, he desperately sent letters WhatsApp to the competitors in Pallo, who took part in the beach festival.
But his messages showed only one gray sign, instead of a pair of blue marks.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26,750 during an ATM filling in Newport on the Live
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 from an ATM-filled worksman in Newport on the Livee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver was empty-armed at the entertainment station and prepared to bring more money, wrote researcher Dennis McCarte's letter.
While he was busy, another man ran behind an employee in Brinks and stole a bag with money to be filled in the ATM.
A witness saw several suspects running from the scene, according to the message, but the police didn't tell how many people were involved in the incident.

Raffer changed his name to Yee.
Raper Kenya West changes his name to Ye.
In proclaiming the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The people who were known as Kenya West."
41-year-old West has been called "Ye" for a while and has used it as his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change comes first to his show on Satredi Night's TV show, where he's expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
He replaced the singer Ariana Granda, who canceled her participation for emotional reasons, so he said that he created the program.
In addition, this is the briefness of his current professional name, and West once said that a word has religious meaning for him.
"I think "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible, the word means "you"," and "st" said earlier this year, when he talked about the name "albumo" with the Big Boy radio deer.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It's gone from Kenya to Kenya, which means the only one, to just the best of his son, the evil of his son, or the confused, everything.
The album is more reflective of who we are."
He's one of those famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Kombes was informed of a substitute named Puff Dadi, P-Dadi or Didi, but this year he declared that he preferred the names "love" and "brotherly love".
West's ex-partner, J.Z., also passed between versions of his name with and without force and letter letters.
The President of Mexico committed not to use the army against civilians.
The elected President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lops Oberdor, has committed never to use military force against civilians, as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
Lops Overdor promised on Saturday at the Teltalco Square that he would never use the army to suppress the Mexican people.
Army forces fired non-violence at the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements began developing throughout Latin America.
Lops Overdor committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by providing financial support to students and opening up public universities free of charge.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double the funding of an artificial building.
As China's activity in the field of artificial understanding gets over, the United States needs to double the amount it invests in research in the field, thus saying the investigator in the field of artificial understanding Kai-po Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His words come after different parts of the U.S. government have made statements about artificial intelligence, even when the U.S. government does not have an official artificial intelligence strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it wants to be number one in an artificial building by 2030.
"Bundling the research budget in the field of artificial understanding will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the United States, and we're looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial understanding," he told me.
Double funding could double the chances that the next great artificial understanding would be achieved in the United States, told the CNBC network in the interview this week.
Lee, who reported "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was released in the month's issue of the Hoghton Mifflin Harcourt, the CEO of the Sino-Innovation Ventures, which was invested in the most prominent artificial intelligence company in China: Face+.
In the last 80th century, at Carnegie Hotel University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the first U.S. lawns, and later served as senior director of the Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch in China.
I was familiar with previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Agency's robotics challenge for advanced research projects, and asked when you'd be next, to help identify the next vision people.
U.S. investigators often have to work hard to win government grants, told me.
"It's not China that takes the leading researchers at the Academy, it's the business companies that do it," he told me.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years raised stars from universities to work in the field of artificial understanding.
I said that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. to strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial understanding.
"I think Green Card should automatically offer a doctorate in the field of artificial understanding," he said.
In July 2017, the China State Council published its artificial understanding plan for the next generation.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding for people at academic institutions in a way similar to the way the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations in the U.S. Department of State of State of State of the Rates of Investigation, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to me.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint centre for artificial construction, which was intended to engage industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the establishment of a special committee for artificial construction.
And the month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an artificial understanding initiative under the name AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in artificial understanding research.
In the meantime, a U.S. legislative initiative designed to create a National Security and Industrial Building Committee has not been in operation for months.
The inhabitants of Macedonia point to a question with the question whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the inhabitants of Macedonia point to a question whether to change their name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that prevented them from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is a district called Macedonia, claims that the name of its north-south neighbourhood is a fence that claims to be in the territory of Greece and that it has been charged with joining NATO and the European Union.
The two countries signed a deal in June based on the new name in question, but members of the nation are opposed to claiming that the change would affect the ethnic identity of the majority of the people in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote in the question of the people and the campaign of the ban cast doubts on whether the number of voters would stand at a minimum of 50% required for the people to be questioned.
The question in the voting note is as follows: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the European Union with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Whoever supports the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zave, claims that this is a price worth paying to Macedonia, which is one of the countries created by the withdrawal of Yugoslavia, you can join bodies like the European Union and NATO.
"I came today to point out the future of the country for young people in Macedonia so that they could live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safe life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgeka in Skopje.
Although the people's question is not legally binding, members of parliament said that they would comply with the results of the vote to turn it into a register.
To change the name, it'll take a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Committee said that there were no irregularities right at 13:00.
However, only 16% of voters stood, compared to 34% in the last election to the parliament in 2016, of which 66% were voting.
"I came to vote because of my kids, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Sosa Tanbsky, voting in the city of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zoroka and his son, Doko, completed their ballot in Stromisha, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, at the people's wish in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will open the door to NATO and the European Union.
At the front of the State House in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kaverdrkov made a small stand and chairs in front of tents that raised those who had threatened the people's wish.
"We're in favour of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join a forward head, not through the server entrance," said Kaverdrov.
"We're a poor country, but we have respect.
If they don't want to take us into Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO companies would bring the most needed investments to Macedonia, where unemployment rate is over 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour of that over 80% of our citizens support the European Union and NATO," said Zibe after he voted.
He said a positive outcome would be our future security.
A survey published on Monday by Macedonia's Policy Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters will participate in the public question - less than the required holding of participation.
Another question, made by the TELMA TV network, found that 57 respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they'd vote.
In order for the people to be successful, the percentage of voters must be at least 50% plus one.
The failure of the wish would be the first significant loss of pro-West government policy since she took over the May government last year.
Video: Manchester City player, Sagru Aguru, driving through all of Bryton's defenses to score a gate
Sahraio Agwaro and the Sterling Winds violated Braiton's defense at the 2-0 Manchester City victory on Saturday at the Mehhad stadium in Manchister, England.
It looked like Aguro was wearing the gate easy.
The Argentine pioneer received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Bratton defense players, before entering the open field.
At this point Aguro found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one shield before he got to run a few more shields on Bryton's borders.
And then he kicked a left pass, and found Starling.
The English translator used his first touch wide to deliver the ball back to Aguro, which kicks at the right foot beat the Bryton Gate, Matthew Ryan, with a bullet on the right side of the net.
Aguarro has problems with his feet, said a director of the Manchester City Writing.
We agreed he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he was the lamb of the gate at the same time."
But it was Starling that gave "the power of the sky" the advantage I started in the fight against the superhero.
This gate came in the 29th minute.
Aguro got the ball deep in Bratton's area during this.
He sent a great cross-ball along the right wing to Leroy Sana.
Sana ran the ball off before he led Starling towards the far corner.
The blue player of the sky pushed the ball into the net right before he slipped out of the field.
Manchester City will face fashions in the champion league game on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rain-Nkar Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play Spoiler in front of the Rockies.
With the Hensonles coming out of the playoff competition, there was no good reason to force another start.
But a loser who is very competitive, hopes to win on Sunday in front of Colorado Rockis, but only if there are still consequences for the playoff for the Rockis, leading one game on the Los Angeles Duggers League NL West.
The Rockis who shot themselves at least a place of open card with a 5-2 win on the Hexionles on Friday night, but they haven't promised themselves the first place at home.
"Although we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the viewers and the second group will play at the highest level, probably at any point I'll face you this year.
"Why don't I want to deal with this?"
The Hensonles have not yet announced the beginning of Sunday, but according to reports, they tend to let the Sherzer serve in such a situation.
Sherzer, it's gonna be his 34th start, it's got a college exercise on Thursday, and it's gonna be his Sunday off.
Washington's right-hand presentation is a 18-7 record with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 hits in 220 rounds 2/3.
Trump's got a stop in West Virginia.
The President pointed to the situation around his elected high court candidate, Bert Kwano, while he spoke of the importance of Republicans coming to vote in the middle of the Senate.
Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five more weeks for the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the most, most-- I'm not running, but actually I am running, so I run everywhere and struggle for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued and said, "You see this terrible group of extremists, you see it happening right now.
And if you're determined to take back the power by whatever means is required, you'll see the convictions, the blasphemies.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to run to get power and control, that's what they want is power and control, we're not gonna give it to them."
Democracies are, according to him, on a mission to resist and disrupt.
"And you see it during the last four days," he said, and called the democratics angry and evil and innocent.
He mentioned the minority leader on the Senate Legal Committee, the Democratic Senator Diane Finstein, who has been leading audience levels.
Remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I waited until -- it was really a bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Leavor Party is no longer a florist.
She's not intolerant of those who express their opinion.
When Momentum traffic operators at my local party pointed to alienating me, it wasn't quite a surprise.
After all, I'm the last in the line of members of parliament from Libre to whom they were told they were not wanted -- and only because we expressed our opinion.
My colleague at the parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she stood firm against Anti - Antichristism.
In my case, the decision to expel me was a visit to me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, to Europe - for most of the irony, subjects similar to those of Ms. Jeremy did not agree with previous party leaders.
On the committee on the Leaver Party meeting of East Nottingham on Friday, it was said, "We want the meeting to be a college-and-procratic."
For most of my eight years as a local member of parliament from the Leavor Party, meetings of the General Committee on Friday night were exactly like this.
Today, however, it is not the rendezvous of many of the meetings and the promise of “kinder, more gentle” politics that has been forgotten since, if ever, it has begun.
It turns out, more and more at the Leibour Party, there is no tolerance for different views, and every opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptance of party leadership.
This situation began not long after Jeremy was elected to the head of the party, when colleagues I had previously thought that we shared a similar political view, began to expect him to make a gesture and take positions that I would never have agreed to -- whether about national security or about one European market.
Every time I speak in public -- and it doesn't really matter what I say -- it immediately comes to an abusive washout of social network evidence with rejection calls, depoliticization of the center and calls I shouldn't be in the Lybour party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more lucky than my colleagues, because the notes that I'm meant to be political.
I'm more familiar with the professionalism and determination of the same colleagues who face a daily flood of racial abuse but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this age of politics is how the level of abuse has become a matter of routine.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Liberian Party must cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're already in the same place as a florist, and with any decision to trust or change the rules of choice, the party becomes more difficult.
Over the past two years, I've had to keep my mouth shut, not be so loud, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not what I got into politics for.
Since I joined the Leavor Party 32 years ago as a school student, I've been looking for a better way to fight social services for those who need them -- whether as a local councilman or a government official.
I've never hidden my political opinions, including the last election.
No man in East Nottingham could in any way confuse my political positions and my issues with my current leadership.
To those who made the decision on Friday, all I have to say is that while the country is crawling towards a braquette that will harm our families, businesses and public service, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Liberian leader.
But to be honest, the one message I have is not to move Momentum Nottingham, but to the public, whether or not they're members of the Labour Party: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of rejection threats or political benefit will keep me from acting in a way I believe that serves to a great extent the interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Unscathed Air to the top
Two last freshs have a little bit of the final result, but there's no doubt that air deserves to win the awesome and glorious game that's been held today in the Scotch High League.
They are now at the top of the table, the only unsuccessful side of the decade.
In the end, it was their best defense, as well as taking a lot more risk, playing for the house team, and coach Peter Morcher's had all the reasons to be happy.
"We've been testing our games so far, and we're still unsuccessful, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christy of the Melrose Group said, "Lair comes in all credit, they took better risks than we do."
Grant Anderson's Trey on the 14th minute, which was played by Fraser Clemo, put Air in the lead position, but a yellow card for the Scottland Rory Hughes team that was released to the game by the Voriors, enabled Melrose to get Jason Bagot's points and catch Trey not Homer.
Clemo picked up Air's transport with a felony, just half past half, he was a lamb and then Mr. Trey Solo to get 17-5 at half an air.
But Melrose opened the second half well and Trey of Patrick Annerson, which was bet by Gott, narrowing the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Rodrich Knut, who was taken away from there in Alonka, and began with the replaying of the game, Air raised the gap through the Trey of Stafford McDowell, which was said by Clemo.
The captain of Air Blair MacPerson Sponge, then a yellow card, and again Melrose used the other person with Trey who wasn't Brose Cologne's Homer, at the end of a series of tremendous pressure.
But the home team recovered, and when Strong Tatchson got a yellow card on a bullet-free Klimo attack, the punishment line, MacPerson Tach's lamb Down behind Air's advanced client.
Clemo Hammer, as he did almost once again from the back to the game, after Kyle Roy Ss kicked David Armstrong's boxing and sent the Gr. Henry to the sixth Trey of the home group.
Star Still Game looks ready for a new career in restaurants.
Star Still Game, Ford Kirnan, looks ready to move to the restaurant branch after he finds out he's been designated as a manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in BBC's popular program, which he writes and sends in with his old roommate Greg Meppel.
The guard announced that the next 9th season would be the final season of the program, and it seems that Kernan is planning a life after Creling.
According to official records, he's the manager of Adreftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to respond to the story, although the source of the scotch San implied that Kiernan was looking for ways to get into the prosperous restaurant business in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours: 'Bolivia that can't find the sea hopes that the court will open up a path to the Pacific.
Sailors patrol at the Navy command, a small boat in La Paz.
Public buildings emit a blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon carry the password: "The sea is ours according to our right.
It's our duty to sue him back."
Throughout Bolivia where there is no sea, the memory of a beach line lost in favour of Chila in bloody conflicts over resources in the 19th century is still alive -- as is the chemistry to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes may have been held for decades, while Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of debate.
Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course he expects from a positive attitude, says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on the basis of broad consensus nationwide, with the hope that the Hague Court will decide in favor of Bolivia’s request that after decades of interrupted calls, it is necessary to negotiate a sovereign access to Bolivia.
The women of Bolivia's charismatic birth, Ou Morales, who face a controversial struggle to re-choice next year, have taken a lot of decision on Monday.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But interpreters think there's no chance that the court will vote for Bolivia -- and that even if it decides for its own good, it won't change much.
The United Nations court sitting in Hagg has no authority to grant Chile's territory, stating that it will not determine the results of possible calls.
The fact that the International Court's statement came six weeks after the hearing of the agreed arguments suggests that the case was "uncomplicated", but Paz Zarata, a Chilean international court expert.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's claims, even the last four years may have weakened them.
"The sea access problem was kidnapped by the current government of Bolivia," said Zarata.
Morales ’ war history, according to Sheila, has destroyed every remnant of goodwill.
At some point Bolivia and Chile will keep talking, but it will be very difficult to have discussions after that.
Both countries have not replaced ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodriguez Vultz, a representative of Bolivia in Hagg, rejected the idea that the court's conviction was abnormally rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia gets a great opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile and to put an end to 139 years of disputes in favour of both sides, he said.
Clazadilla also denied that Morales -- who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America -- is using the issue of the sea as a political object.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific," he added.
"Cessation is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear damage clearance won't happen unless she can trust the United States.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Young, said that he would never want to launch the nuclear weapon first if she couldn't trust in Washington.
Ree spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two rival countries.
It appears that the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompau, is on the threshold of a reopening of diplomatic contacts on nuclear weapons that have reached a dead end more than three months after the Singapore summit with a North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Rie said it was "a dream in Asfamia" to think that the continued sanctions and resistance of the United States to declare the end of the Korean war would force North Korea to a knees.
The U.S. is afraid to agree to a declaration without North Korea first taking significant steps to launch a nuclear weapon.
They're Kim and the president of the United States, Donald Trump, interested in summit two.
However, there is widespread uncertainty that North Korea is serious about the interpretation of its nuclear weapon position, where it is likely to see the only way to protect its safety.
Pompey's planning to visit Pyongyang next month to make a second summit between Kim and Trump.
A fashion show in Paris reveals the new tarnd in giant hats found on its way to expensive stores everywhere.
We'll figure out the solution for anyone who wants to expand the hat collection or get full sun protection.
The designers, Valentino and Tom Brown were exposed to a line of huge, crazy head coverings for their SS19 configuration, in a fashion show that slammed the fashion style scene in Paris.
Undivided hats have taken off the summer Instagram, and these designers have brought their extraordinary works to the fashion display track.
Valentino's outstanding item was an overcolored hat on the far corners of a flying image that covered the heads of the models.
Other well-known props included lilies, a magic hat and even anaesthetics -- but they weren't meant to protect the head from the cold.
Tom Brown also revealed a strange mask selection-- check in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks included dyeing lips and blood for Hannibal Lecter than for Hot Kutor.
One creature mentioned a dive mask including Norkel and glasses, and another looked like a dry ice cream cup.
And whoever wants to continue with a huge-scale fashion statement -- their time has come.
Fabulous fashion breakers watch the giant hills make their way to the fancy stores everywhere.
The giant hats are the next hit after her bomba, the hard hat with a half-metre-metre backs, starting with Mariana and Emily Retiqowski.
Lybel Calt behind the very non-extreme hat that surrounded the social networks that generated another big piece of craft on the track -- a key-size sea bag almost as big as that of a model of the sea suit he carried.
A brown-colored foam bag, with a white-skinned foaming shell, was the most prominent item in the SS19 collection of Jaline La Rivira's fashion week in Paris.
A tylist known as Luke Armitage said to the FEMAIL: "I watch large hats and big sea bags arrive at the expensive stores next summer -- because the design made a huge impression and it would be hard to ignore the demand for excessive exospheres."
John Edward: Language skills are vital to the citizens of the world
The Independent Schools of Scotland keep a record of academic excellence, and this went on in 2018 with a further collection of extraordinary test results, which is supported by personal and group success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), are moving to give the best service to students and parents.
Independent schools are eager to prepare their students for another and higher education, a career they will be chosen and placed as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can plan and develop a program of personal adaptation, we discover modern languages that continue to be popularized as a desirable field of study at school.
Nelson Mandela said: “Speaking to a man in a language he understands, he got into his head.
Speaking to a man in his own language, it went into his heart."
It's an important reminder that we can't rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the last test year, you can see languages in the top tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who have learned foreign languages have achieved a high A score.
The data collected from the 74 SCIS-related schools showed that 72% of students achieved a higher A score in Mandarinian, as were 72% of those in German, 69% of those in French and 63% of those in Spanish.
These data show that schools of independence in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Today, language as a subject of choice is considered at the same level as STEM subjects (Scientific, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in the school curriculum and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the British Employment and Skills Council found that according to the reasons that employers cited codes to fill available functions, 17% would be lacking in language skills.
Thus, in a growing and growing sense, language skills are essential to preparing students for future careers.
There are language requirements for future employment opportunities, and these skills are vital in a world of globalization.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he learns a second language, he will have a significant future advantage because of this lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries is automatically stable.
According to a 2013 Yogov survey involving more than 4,000 adults in Britain, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language at a level sufficient for a conversation, and French was the only language in which there was a double-reporting number of speakers, 15 percent.
That's why it's important to invest today in teaching children languages.
Knowledge of many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, every school will be different about the languages we learn.
Some of the schools will focus on modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most thoughtful for Britain with a view to changing the 20th century, such as Mandrian and Japanese.
No matter what the child's area of interest is, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in the independent schools, with a team of teachers specializing in the field.
The Independent Schools of Scotland are obliged to provide a school environment that prepares children and hunts them with skills that are needed to succeed, in any foreseeable future.
Today, in the global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance to the future, so this fact needs to be expressed in education.
Indeed, modern languages have to be seen in international communications skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland’s children.
It's the time warrant.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish council for independent schools.
LeBron is expected to play for the first time in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait was over for fans waiting to see LeBron James playing for the first time in the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach, Luke Walton, announced that James would play the pre-season game in front of the Denver Negats on Sunday in San Diego.
But we haven't set a few minutes before he'll play.
It'll be more than one and less than 48, written on Lakers' official website.
Lake Mike Trudle wrote on Twitter, which is likely James will play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers' pre-season games.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Trump's stop hour in West Virginia, Utope channel
President Donald Trump opens an election fair in Welling tonight, the Virginia system.
This is the first of five planned stops of Trump this week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While voting for approval of his appointment to the Supreme Court judge, Trump is in the process of building support for the upcoming election of the middle priesthood, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
What time is Trump's arrest in West Virginia tonight and how can it be watched online?
Trump's stop in Welling, West Virginia, is scheduled to start at 19:00 in the east coast on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can be watched at Trump's stop in West Virginia on the Internet in a direct Utope flow.
Tramp is likely to be referring to the hearings held this week for the Supreme Court of the United States of America, and became the target of harassment around the charges of inappropriate sexual conduct and following up on the rejection of the vote in St.
But the main purpose of this arrest wash is to help Republicans facing the November challenges of elections to gain some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's election headquarters said that the purpose of these five arrests next week is "to stimulate volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of them in Saint and the House of Representatives", according to Wrighters.
“Conversal control is so critical to his agenda, until the President is willing to visit as many countries as possible with the entrance to the crowded election season”, he told Reweiter to report to Trump's campaign that he had asked to remain in public.
The arrest tonight, scheduled to take place at the Wesbunko Stadium in Welling, can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract press coverage from the press in Pittsburgh, to the West Virginia Metro Newse.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Stramp visits West Virginia, the country where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump's trying to help a Republican candidate for St. from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisi, who's retarded by polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morisi that the President has to come to try to improve his situation in the polls," said Simon Heider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Roiter.
Rider Cup 2018: U.S. team shows right to struggle to maintain hope for the single games on Sunday
After three single-sided tooth games, the four games on Sunday afternoon may be exactly what the Ryder Cup needs.
Momentum's drive is an entirely created sport concept, but players really believe in it, and never more than in competitions like this.
So where do they think we'll find the momentum now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so you can see a little momentum," said Joan Speth at the end of a day.
Europe is, of course, four points ahead with 12 more in the game.
But, as Speth says, "the Americans feel a little bit of a ghost, and they have a lot to encourage, and not the last of them in the form of a couch" and "Stin Thomas playing together all day, and each of them is on three points out of four.
Speth's was a killer from Hetty to Green and he's a personal example leader.
The shouts of joy increased as his turn continued, when he drowned a critical Pat to win the four-square game and Thomas went down two after two.
His Pat who won the 15on game won a similar shout, the kind that shows he believes that the American team still has hope.
"Really just need to dig deep and worry only about your own game," said Speth.
That's all that's left for each of those players to do.
18 waves to leave a seal.
During the last two days, Thomas is Francesco Molineri and Tommy Fletwood, the first unprovoked story of the Ryder Cup.
The weird, but the charming, of Europe is four out of four and wins everybody's admiration.
"Mollywood" was the only double that didn't hit the device on Saturday afternoon, but they were also prevented from bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and 9:00 a.m.
The same round, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic audience, is based on the fact that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fletwood or Molinry to sign the potential European victory with the sun settling on the Le Golf National golf field.
They're both better at the same time in different waves.
However, it's early to speak of European fame.
Dolla and Tasson Web Simpson ended up with Sergeiu Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he robbed Alex Norne.
Bogey and two times the front nine took off the Spanish and the robbers into the hole that they didn't get close to getting out of it.
However, on Sunday there's no one to help you get out of the hole.
It's interesting to take a close look at the four pills and the fours because of the interactions between the two sides, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change like an eyebrow.
Europe has played better as a group so far and significantly towards the last day, but this fourth sleep has shown that the American team is full of a spirit of fighting that some, mainly within the United States, have questioned.
Europe leads 10-6 towards the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is on a healthy track towards the last day of the Ryder Cup after completing the four-ball and four-throw games on Saturday by 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired tightness of Tommy Fletwood and Vernsko Molinry led to the change with two wins over the wrestling tiger Woods, and has thus far brought the gap to four points at the Le Golf National.
The European side players of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to protect the trophie they lost in Heislettin two years ago, ruled in front of the Americans who missed the four-ball games this morning and brought the series to 3-1.
The American players showed greater resistance to the four games, and won two games, but they couldn't close the gap.
To keep holding the cup, Jim Porrick's friends need eight points from the 12 single games.
Fletwood is the first European rocket to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who won the name "Molilwood" after an extraordinary weekend, are only the second couple who won four points from their four opening games in Ryder Cup's history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball games, they continued with a remarkable harmony together to defeat the All-Weds and the American Bryson Dachmbao route as a result of an even greater increase of 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged himself across two games on Saturday, showed random outbreaks of excellence, but so far he's lost 19 out of 29 games of four and four, and seven in a row.
Stan Rose, who sat down during the four-ball games of the morning, went back to join Henrik Stanson in the four-time games to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coca -- which ranks first and third in the world.
However, not everything went easily to play Europeans in the temperate weather and the calm wind that settled south-west of Paris.
The outstanding winner three times Jordan Spatt and Steven Thomas presented the trail for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a two-and-a-one victory over John Ram, Spain, and Ian Fulter in the four-ball games, and later returned to defeat Peter and Rahri McLeroy 4 and 3 in the four games, after losing the first two bodies.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup team back from a negative four-point gap to the single games, although as the holders of the cup, Porrick's people need only the file to keep holding the cup.
However, after two days in second place, the attack on Sunday seems to be beyond their ability.
North Korea says she's not going to break apart from one-sided, untrustworthy kisses.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea announced on a Saturday that the sanctions continued to deepen its mistrust in the United States and that there is no way that the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under these circumstances.
Rey Young Ho announced at the annual United Nations General Assembly that North Korea has taken on significant good will in the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear tests, the launch of nuclear testing sites and the commitment not to develop further nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see any match on the part of the United States," he said.
Without trust in the United States, we can't be sure about our national defence and under such conditions in no way and we won't be able to unload ourselves from nuclear weapons.
While Sherry reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about the U.S.'s opposition to access to nuclear disarmament, that North Korea will be rewarded as it takes step-by-step action, his statement seems important because it did not reject nuclear denuclearization, as it had done in North Korea before.
Rey referred to a joint announcement made by Kim Jong On and Donald Trump on the first summit of history between an American high-ranking president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim committed himself to a "nuclear denuclearization of the Korean sub-island" while Trump promised to protect the safety of North Korea.
North Korea requested an official end to the Korean War, which began in 1950-1953, but the United States said that North Korea must give up its nuclear weapons first.
The United States has also opposed reading to reduce international sanctions on North Korea.
The U.S. insists on nuclear denuclearization first, and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goal in the way of will, and even resists the proclamation of the end of war, says Rie.
The perception that sanctions can cause us to bow down is a dream in the asthma of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is the terrible sanctions are deepening our mistrust."
Rey never mentioned the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the President of the United States highlighted in his speech earlier in the week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader, Moon Gia-Nin, in the last five months, adding: "If the other side of the nuclear detonation problem was South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come from such a dead end."
Even so, Rie's speech was dramatically different from last year's, so he told the United Nations General Assembly that the U.S. Earth attack on North Korea's missiles is inevitable after Mr. President of Evil Trump named Kim Rocket Man on the suicide mission.
Last year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened North Korea's total destruction, commended Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said that there was still a lot more work to do and that the sanctions must remain in the cloud until North Korea's nuclear detonation.
On Wednesday, Trump said he doesn't have a defined time frame for this, adding, "If it takes two, three or five years, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claimed that the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for steps taken.
However, the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompau, said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with determination and without stopping until we have achieved a complete and unified final nuclear denuclearization."
The Security Council has supported one action on North Korea since 2006 in trying to block funding of its ballistic and nuclear missile plans.
Pompey met Rey on the outskirts of the United Nations General Assembly and later said he'd be visiting Pyongyang again next month to prepare the next summit.
Pompey has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not gone well.
He left E. Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for setting himself up as "Gangster requirements".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear facility, if the United States takes appropriate steps.
He said that Kim told him that the "corresponding steps" he was interested in included security mergers on which Trump committed in Singapore, as well as changes in the direction of normalization of the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough.
A new course at Harvard University this year teaches participants how to sleep more, in an effort to fight in the culture of Mach and the wider learning by staying awake all night with caffeine.
academic research has found that students at University No. 1 in the world often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kessler, professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and expert at the Brigham and Wymans Hospital, planned the course, which he assessed as the first in the United States.
He was inspired to open the course after a talk about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of the talk, one girl approached me and said: 'Why do you just tell me that now, in my last year of school?'
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleeping -- what surprised me," he told the Tagelf newspaper.
The course, which is delivered for the first time this year, explains to students the principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall condition.
Paul Brea, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and senior director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to open the course after finding out that students had had a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive missions.
In one part, there is a picture of a room in the dormitory, where students press coffee baskets, curtains, sports clothes and books -- to get explanations of the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleeplessness, as well as the importance of routine sleep.
In another part, it tells participants how persistent insomnia may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a campus map, if interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know it won't change the behavior of the students overnight.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effects of choosing cigarettes, added Professor Cizzler.
According to a culture of pride over sleepless nighttime success, modern technology and increasing pressure on students are causing a growing sleep shortage.
Concern for sufficient sleep, and good sleep, needs to be each student's secret weapon to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation leads the brain to hunger, so we're hungry all the time.
Raymond Soo, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Zizler design the course, after taking part in one of his first year classes in Harvard.
He said that the course lighted his eyes and moved him to encourage a course for the whole campus.
The next step, as he hopes, will be to ask all students for advanced descriptions to complete a similar instruction program before joining the competition institution.
Professor Eisel recommended students to check the possibility of aiming a clock when it's time to go to bed, not just at the time when they have to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of a blue light that emits electronics and LED light, which can break the throttle rate and thus cause problems in the coma.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rings: A gate of manga stands for Jared's players
Herring's caught another attack of losing a game except when Dolly Manga caused Stephen Reard's rebel players to defeat 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrax players were hoping to win their first win in the game except since 1-4 February in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team lost only one in 18 games and left the team behind eight points after the bright Hartz team headed for the Soviet League.
Manga attacked seven minutes before half and it didn't seem to be the uninspirationed Rangers.
While Herring's is now falling to the sixth place, Livingstone climbs to the third place immediately after the Hibernian in the middle of a gate.
And you may be waiting for another Rangers Dubble after the Kwan Kaloma Spence needed treatment for a head injury after he probably wanted to be thrown out of the bid.
Jared counted eight hours in a group that passed on Air to the middle of the final in a cup in Tfarf.
Holt, on the other hand, came up with the same 11 Livingston players who made a point of Hartz last week, and he could have been 7th of a desire for the way his players played the match anyway.
Herring'ers may have controlled the holding of the ball, but Livingstone did more with the ball he had in their hands.
They almost took the second minute when Manga sent a bullet to Scott Patman and kicked to Alan McGregor's gate, but the middle-field player kicked the ball too far.
Then Kegan Jacob's deep, deep kick found Captain Craig Alekt, but his shield Allen L'Gui could only kick out of the hook.
Herring's did take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their last third game.
Alfredo Morlos certainly thought that he should have been guilty after a quarter of a game, when he and Steven Wills clashed, but Judge Stephen T. Wesson stood up against the evils of the Colombian actor.
Herring's only managed to kick twice the gate in the first half, but the Abrox Leam Kelly knocked easily on Sana Colivali's leg and the weak kick of Obi Agaria.
While Livingston's opening of the 34th minute was opposed to the way the game was conducted, no one would deny that they were worthy of it at least for their hard work.
Herring's again failed to cope with Jacob's deep freeball.
Scott Artfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher transferred the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his temper cool by moving to Manga to a simple ending.
Jared did a half-time job when he replaced Collebelly with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had an effect almost when the extreme/blowing wing a bullet to Morlos but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block it.
But Livingstone continued to force the host group to play the exact kind of game it liked, as Guy and Lact continued to send long bullets.
Holt’s group could have increased the lead at other stages, but McGregor stood up well to prevent Jacobs from trying before a conflict broke out of the corner.
Herring's substitute player, Dr. Glen Middleton, was subsequently charged with felony in front of Jacobs, but Thompson was ignored again.
You're making up Mona Giger.
And now stand by the name of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and continue... the day when the future physicist Johannes Willem was born in Germany.
Gary has developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to a device known as Mona Giger.
Since then, the device has become a medium in science, but in 1950 it has also become a module in pop culture thanks to the film "Bells of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans were placed as two strange mornings/scientists:
Man, "What the hell is this thing?"
Roger's: "This is Mona Giger, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put the headphones together, you can really hear the effects of radioactivity on the atoms in the minerals."
Evans: "Oh, my God, it's really a bomb now!"
Hans Giger went to his world in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live after him.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see cancer cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and eliminate them.
Immunization teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells as part of treatment
The method includes rescue of immune cells from the patient, and replacement of cells in the lab.
Then the cells can see a protein that's shared by many cancers and then they're tricky back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells, has been missing for more than 18 months.
The method includes extracting immune cells from the patient, changing cells in the lab so that they can “see” a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers, and then throwing cells back into the patient.
Professor J. Brazovsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Battsda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “Reducing the development of a number of cancers”, including cancer of the demon, the syphilis, the vision and the bowels, explained a professor of Brazilians.
Similar approach to taking vaccine cells from patients and "learning" them how to attack cancer cells has been successful in treating a type of blood cancer.
Kenya West broke into a speech supporting Tramp, with a MAGA hat in his head, after he showed up in SNL.
It wasn't taken in a nice eye.
Kenya West responded to the posses at the studio during a confused show on the Starday Night League, praising the President of the United States Donald Trump and saying he was running for presidents in 2020.
After making his third song on the show, called "Gossed Town" in the performance of Make America Great hat, he broke a statement in protest against the democratics and reiterated his support in the tramp.
"So many times I talk to white people who say, "How can you love Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL's episode began with a rendezvous of Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star mocked Bert Kuano's testimony to the Senate's Legal Committee regarding charges of sexual assault by Christine Blazy Ford.
Even though the argument twin didn't broadcast on the show, the thing was brought up to social networks by the comitorian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to roll on West in advertising the thing.
Plus, West complained in front of the audience that he had taken backstage criticism of the hat he wore.
They attacked me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go on stage with that hat on your head."
They attacked me!
And then they said I was in a dark place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued and said, "Do you want to see the dark place?" By saying he's wearing my Superman hat, because it means no one can tell me what to do.
Try to show love."
His words were read at least twice by the audience, and it seemed that SNL team members were embarrassed, the Variety report, and one of them said to the newspaper, "Shut of atom fell in the entire studio."
West is attached to the program as last minute in place of her ex-partner, Ariana Granda, who died a few days before.
West was many when he performed the song I love when he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the SPUSA conservative team, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest souls: thank you for not giving in to the crowd."
But the presentation of the Atticalia Fund Hunter wrote on Twitter West just "He was who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
But I chose not to reward it (by buying music or betraying it or supporting his "art") that I think is an effort and a dissemination of ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we," she added.
Before the program, Raper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, and said that now he is the woman who was known in the past as the buyer West.
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Didi, Papi and P Didi.
Another rapper, Snoop Doc, held the name Snoop Lyon, and of course the known musician Prince changed his name to a symbol and later to a former artist of the Kryreins.
A murder charge for stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
According to the police incident occurred in Liberia.
The suspect is expected to appear before the Blastest court on Monday.
The charges will be checked by the Public Prosecution Service.
The star of the throne games, Keith Harrington, attacks toxic masculinity
Kitt Rinton is known for his role as "The Snow of the Guns Wing of the violent marine-beneficent fantasy series" of the throne games.
But the 31-year-old player attacked the Machu hero's stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen are often passed on to young children the message that they must be tough to honor.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married another star in the throne games, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he was very troubled about treating this kind of thing.
"Man, I feel very troubled right now -- where did we make a mistake on the way to masculinity?" He said.
"What do we teach men in their growing age, from the point of view of the problem we're witnessing to now?"
Keith thinks that TV may be partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity, because of the very male characters she presents.
He continued: “What comes from inside, and what will we learn from the outside?
What should we learn from TV, and on the street, that makes young kids feel that they must be on this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the biggest questions of our time -- how do you change it?
'Cause there's no doubt something went wrong for young men."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not participate in any series of events or a series of title games after the end of the series next summer, saying that he was "completed with fields of battle and horses".
Starting in November Keith will be re-edited to the play of a real Sam Shepard-Guarn, who will tell the story of a film producer and his bandits.
The actor recently found out he saw that he had met his wife Rose as the best thing that ever happened as a result of the throne games.
"I knew my wife in a series, so that this series gave me my future family, and my life from that moment on," he said.
Rose played the role of Yogwright, John Snow's love theme, in the fantasy show wins the Hammy Award.
We married in June 2018 at the Lesley family court in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% rise in new cases
China has announced a 14% leap in its number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have a disease, thus giving up official health factors.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 only.
The vast majority of new cases have been infected as a result of the existence of sex, which is a change to the past.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in certain parts of China as a result of infected blood vessels.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, according to official health factors in China at a conference in Yoonan County.
Yet, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China rose by 100,000.
The infections of HIV resulting from the existence of sex are a burning problem in the U.S. community in China.
Homosexuality ceased to be anti-law in China in 1997, but it was said that the crime against U.S. members was extensive.
Because of the state's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who had sex with men ended up marrying women.
Many cases of infection are the result of a lack of protective measures.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a man from her team leaked information about a Republican Senator and protected the "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
The American Senator Maxine Waters rejected the charges on Saturday that a member of her team had published personal information about three American Senators on the Vikipedia pages of the Senators.
The democratic Senator of Los Angeles estimated that the claims are split by websites and are visiting extreme right-wing sites.
"Falses, lies, and other detestable lies," said Waters in a Twitter announcement.
According to the reports, the information published included the residence addresses and telephone numbers of the American Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orin Hatz, both of them from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, and was published by an unknown person at the Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate Commission on charges of sexual misconduct not brought against the Supreme Court candidate, Bert Kuano.
The leak occurred sometime after the three Senators asked Kavannu.
Marine sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was linked to Waters' office and published information on a member of Waters' team, according to the Hill Report.
This baseless charge is totally wrong and a total lie, plus Waters.
"My team member -- whose identity and personal details were exposed and his safety was affected by these false accusations and accusations -- was in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This baseless guilt is totally wrong and a total lie."
The announcement of Waters Graedings is fast on the Internet, including from the former White House Press Secretary Ari Flycher.
"That's denial angry," wrote Fleicher.
“The thing is that she doesn’t have the temper required of Congressmen.
When someone's charged with something he didn't do, he can't react in anger.
He's not allowed to react in a bad way.
He can't question the motives of the perpetrators.
He has to be calm and quiet."
It seemed that Flyscher was comparing Waters' response to a review of the democratics of Judge Kwano, who accused visitors who appeared to be too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Umar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to defeat Waters in the middle of the priesthood, has also raised his thoughts on Twitter.
Great if it's true, he wrote on Twitter.
In her announcement, Waters said that the survivor had turned to the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these false claims.
"We'll make sure the offenders find out" is the gravity, and they'll be tried for all their destructive and dangerous actions towards my crew."
Johnie Ingleish 3.0'-- a weaknessed spy set in the back of Roan Atkinson.
It is now acceptable to look for meanings about Brczeit in any new film with a British perspective, and it does seem to fit this resurrection of the "Cumdia Action Division" in the June English series -- which started somewhere in 2003 with Johnny English and woke up back to life in 2011 with Johnny English coming back.
Is an ironic self-stealing on how much we're not worth, making it the new export opportunity of our country?
In any case, the shambles of the Solomon Islands and the rubbery face have had another opportunity to spoil things -- and his name represents more than any other large-scale platform that was designed to be watched in non-English-speaking countries.
He's, of course, the stupid English agent, who, despite his strange face-to-face attitude to a smooth glow, seems a little like a clauzo, a little master between and a bit more than this guy who's a single donor to the beautiful fire trains in the opening text of the Olympics in London in 2012.
It is also originally based on the mysterious international passenger who age Atkinson in television ads that are forgotten to Barclaycard, allowing chaos behind him.
There's one minute or two nice in Johnny Ingleish's last edition.
I liked the part where Johnny Ingleish approached a helicopter wearing a Middle Ages armor, and my pusher's heart rang for moments on his helmet.
Atkinson exhibits his local physical abilities, but Homer feels pretty weak and oddly unnecessary, especially since the type of practice movies like 007 and an impossible task themselves now includes a floor component.
The humor feels like it's turning to the kids instead of the adults, and to me the crazy, crazy adventures of Johnny Ingleish are less brilliant and focused on the jokes of Atkinson's film style as Mr. Bean's character.
The film poll starts with a major threat to Britain.
Computer hacking into the British spy's super-secret Internet network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, alarmed by the chief agent -- unfortunately a small role for Kevin Aldon.
It's the last straw for a government chief in a proud and battle - who is already suffering from the complete collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson does her best to fill the role of Teresa May, but she has nothing to do with the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy has been exposed, she'll have to bring someone back from completion.
And that means 'Ni Ingleish Harbany himself, now employed as a school manager at a prestigious institution, but gives informal lessons in how to be a hidden spy: some good jokes here, when English offers an Academy for School Rock Course.'
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and combined with his former assistant to the Buff sufferer, which again marks Ben Miller.
Buff is now a man married to a boat command, in the role of an annoying high-school queen on which Vicofrin is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's secret service income to a terrible crisis are coming back into operation, with a beautiful Pam-Pattal in the form of an oblivion of Boltova, which plays the Olega Corilenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the guise of billionaire Chrysics Technology who claims to be able to solve the evil British computer problems - Jason Walta at the age of Jake Lacey.
An English and Buff start at their Academy, which is more than a pair of clowns: under the cover of waiters, they fire a fancy French restaurant; they create an enzyme when they smuggle themselves into the glorious yacht of Walta; and Angleish completes anarchy in his attempt to use a similar reality assessment to learn the interior structure of Walta's house.
No doubt all efforts are made to lead to the last sequence, but despite the affections and bitches, it feels like a child's TV.
Pretty mid-level.
Like the other June English movies, I couldn't help but think: Can the British movie industry not give Ron Atkinson a role that does justice with his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it's making a plan for the British to work four days a week, but get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbin's Leavor Party is considering a revolutionary plan by the Britishs to work four days a week - but they'll get paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants company managers to pass on the savings as a result of the artificial understanding revolution (AI) to employees in the form of another day off.
I mean, employees will have a three-day weekend, and they'll still get the same salary.
Sources have said that the idea is for the company's economic agenda and plans to influence the country for the benefit of employees.
The Congress of the Professional Associations supports the transition to a four-day work week in the way employees can enjoy economic changes.
One of the leading sources of the Lybour Party said to Sandy Times: “Policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but this four-day work week is where it fits the party's approach to economic resuscitation for employees, as well as to the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party called for a four-day week of work during its 2017 election campaign.
However, the service is not supported at this moment by the Leibour Party as a whole.
"A four-day work week is not a party policy, and the Party does not consider it."
Leaver's candidate for the treasure minister, John McDonnell, used the party meeting last week to put his vision into a socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to get back power from the 'unfaced managers' and 'price deals' in service companies.
It also follows from the plans of the Minister of Treasure that current shareholders and shareholders of water companies may not be able to return their full investment because the Liberian government may do the least on the basis of the discovery of improper conduct.
It also confirms that there are plans to bring up employees to the board of directors of companies and to create full-fledged contracts to transfer 10% of the private sector's assets to employees, which will be introduced into the two-year dividends of up to 500 years.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told the TV show '60 minutes' if the FBI investigation of Kavannu would change their mind.
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Bert Kwano has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question whether the findings of the investigation can convince the Republicans to withdraw their support.
On the first day of the 60-minute program, Scott Fly asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their mind.
It looked like Kennedy was more open than his party colleague from South Carolina.
I mean, of course, Candy said.
"I said to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavano.
I called him after it happened, that the charge came up, and I said did you do it?'
He was decisive, determined, conclusive."
On the other hand, Graham's vote seems to be a rock hunt.
"I've already decided about Burt Kavano and there'll be a need for a blow-up charge," he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Bert denied it, added Graham, referring to Christine Blazy Ford.
And no man she mentioned could confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see how anything can change."
What is the world's citizens' festival, and did it contribute anything to reduce poverty?
Saturday, New York, dates the World Civil Festival, a yearly music event with a most impressive list of stars that will appear and an equally impressive goal of an end to the world's poverty.
The World Civilist Festival, which exists this seventh time, will bring to it tens of thousands of people who have been driven to great grass in Central Park, not only to enjoy such shows as "gent Jackson", Cardi Bee and Sean Mends, but also to increase awareness of the real purpose of the event -- to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Civilist Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless willing to pay for a VIP card), the concert Island must complete a series of missions, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, calling or other significant ways to help raise awareness for ending poverty.
But how successful has the festival really been, when it's only 12 years ahead of him to accomplish its purpose?
Is the idea of giving a free ticket to people to this concert really a way to convince them to require a call for action, or is it another case of clictivism -- people who feel that they really are affecting by signing an enormous web page or sending a peep on Twitter?
Since 2011, the World Civil Society has reported more than 19 million actions in support of it, pushing for a variety of different objectives.
According to him, these actions have helped drive world leaders to declare commitments and policies worth over $37 billion that would affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By the beginning of 2018, the group had quoted 390 commitments and declarations as a result of its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already begun distribution or fundraising.
The group estimates that so far funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the core commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partner of committed investors and businessmen to "help children grow to full their potential", and promises Rwanda $35 million to help put an end to the provision of nutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 hits on Twitter from "Citizens of the World".
With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and ‘world citizens’ like you, we can make social justice on the subject of sub-educated comment in history, said that Ambassador The Power of Nutrition Tracy Olman to the audience during the London live concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 operations called on Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the pace of the project, Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children with an intervention in nutrition.
"What makes you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
Citizens of the world have responded: This will be a long and difficult path -- sometimes falling and failing.
But, like the great movements ahead of us of civil rights and resistance to the Parthead, we'll succeed, because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mends, Cardi B and Jannell Mona are among some of the shows that will come up at New York's New York Year's event, which will serve Bee Lee Fornes and Joe McMan.
The U.S. could use the Navy to delay the Russian energy export -- the Secretary of the Interior.
As far as necessary, Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, and discovered the American Face Minister Ryan Zink, as noted at Washington Examiner.
Zinc claimed that the Russian involvement in Syria - which was made, important to mention, at the invitation of the legal government - is a race to spread to new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern abdomen of Europe," he reported.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States is capable, with our fleet, of ensuring that the sea currents are open and at the time when a siege needs to be imposed to ensure that their energy sources do not reach the market," he said.
Zinky spoke in the presence of an event called Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued his words and compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, stating that they were indeed identical.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the funding and replacement of fuels”, he said, while referring to Russia as a "pony of one trick" because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump government is on mission to increase its degraded natural gas export to Europe, replacing Russian energy sources, which are much cheaper for European consumers.
To that end, Trump's government officials, and all the President of the United States, Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to cancel its participation in the "undeservable" pipeline project Nord Street 2, which, according to Trump's words, has turned Berlin into Moscow's "swift."
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the pipeline project, which has cost up to $11 billion and is supposed to double the current pipeline capacity of 110 billion square metres, is only an economic project.
The Carmelin claims that Washington's firm opposition to the project is prevented only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we are partners in the belief that energy cannot be a pressure trigger and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers", said Russian energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting in Moscow with the U.S. Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, in September.
The U.S. position won an anti-fever response from Germany, which reconfirmed its commitment to the project.
BDI, the leading organization of the German industry sector, called on the United States to keep the energy policy of the European Union and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Campef, head of the German Industry Organization (BDI), following a recent meeting between the German chancellor, Angela Markle, and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, "take seriously" the run for the presidency in 2020.
The Senator of Messcess and Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would seriously consider the possibility of running for the presidency after the middle of the Academy.
Warren confirmed her intention to run for office during a meeting in Hollock City, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government, and for that, there's a need for a woman to be in the head," she said, according to The Hill newspaper.
After 6 November, I will seriously consider the race for President.
Warren expressed her opinion on President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
I'm worried up to my bone demon about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very cautiously visiting Trump for the appointment of Bert Kuano as Supreme Court judge.
Well, Warren said, "of course, we need the FBI's investigation before the vote."
However, a survey published on Warren’s own election showed that she did not think she should run for the 2020 elections.
Fifty-eight percent of the “potential” voters in the Sachsen 'Sts said that the Senator should not run for election, according to a survey by the Center for Political Research of the University of Supok and the newspaper of Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the intention to deal with the Senator's presidency.
The survey showed that there was greater support for the run-off of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent who supported his run-in against 48 percent who opposed her.
Cross-cutting figures from the Fat Democratic Party have been linked to possible elections to the 2020 elections include former Vice-President Joe Beiden and Senator Mormont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision in January, according to I.P. reports.
Sarah Filin points out the post-traumatic stress disorder of Trak Pline at Donald Trump's arrest.
26-year-old Trak Pline in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on a day in 'night.
"What's going on with my son, what's been through since he came back, allows me to identify with families experiencing the consequences of the PTSD disorder and with some of the injuries that our soldiers are returning," she told the audience participating in the arrest for Donald Trump in the city of Tolsa, Oklahoma.
Pline called her "The Phil in the Room" arrest and said about her son and other released soldiers, "They come back a little different, they go back hard, they come back and wonder if what they gave the country to their members and the airmen, and all the other military personnel, is respected".
He was arrested on a day in Wesilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, disruption of the report of family violence and possession of a weapon under a lease, according to Dan Bennet, who is speaking with the Wesilla Police.
18 countries and the province of Colombia support the challenge of the new state asylum policy
Eighteen countries and the province of Colombia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy which refuses to give shelter to victims of situations in which gang violence or family violence are involved.
Delegates from the 18 countries and the district have been making a statement of the "Friend of the Court" in Washington, D.C., with the aim of supporting the challenge of asylum seekers' policy, according to the NBC report.
The full name of the complainant in Grace v. Schens, who filed the American Civil Rights Union in August, was unexposed.
She said that her partner and his violent sons, gang members, abused her but that official factors in the U.S. government rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace's state attorneys described the countries of Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of which are subject to requests for asylum in the United States, as nations dealing with many problems concerning gangs and family violence.
The U.S. new State Asylum Policy repealed a BIA Migration Council decision in 2014 that allowed migrants without certificates fleeing from situations of domestic violence to apply to a State asylum.
The Attorney General of Columbia County, Carl Resin, stated in a statement on the day and "that the new policy "is ignoring the ten years of state law, federal and international law".
“Federal law requires that all proceedings concerning requests for State asylum be based on the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and the barrier set by the new policy violates this principle”, said the Court's friend's statement.
The lawyers also claimed that the policy, which prevents the entry of migrants, damages the economy of the United States, because they tend to become initiatives and "provide necessary work", they say.
Attorney General Jeff Schensen ordered immigration judges not to give more State asylum to victims who fled from family abuse and gang violence in June.
“The State haven is open to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of racial, religious, national or social groups or political opinion, ” said Schensen in a message about the policy he gave on June 11.
The purpose of the State asylum has never been to ease all the problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
The rescue efforts are desperate in Palo, while the killers are doubled, in the race to find survivors.
For the survivors the situation has become more difficult than once.
"There's a very tense feeling," said Risa Cosma, 35, and if a baby gets hot in the center of the falloon in the ruined city of Palo.
Every moment the ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is rare."
The residents appeared to be returning to their ruined homes, passing between water-slip objects, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 earthquake, were flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Duvy Harris, who suffered back and shoulder fractures, lay outside Palo's military hospital, where they received treatment for a powerful general shock that they had suffered after the earthquake.
Tears filled his eyes as he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris said to the A.P.A., adding that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're in a safe place."
The U.S. ambassador blames China for "brains" with propaganda ads.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the United States of America, while aggressively promoting trade advantages between the United States of America and China, the U.S. ambassador accused Big'ing of using American press to disseminate propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump, last day, referred to the payment supplement of the Chinese newspaper China Daily, at Moyin Register, the most widely sold newspaper in the state of Eva, after accusing China of attempted election to the American Congress on November 6, claiming that China was rejected.
The accusation of Trump of China attempted to interfere with the U.S. elections, marked a new stage, according to official sources in the United States, on the ceremony that was conducted in Washington with a view to putting pressure on China.
Although foreign governments may publish ads for the promotion of trade, Big'ing Washington is now stuck in a proud trade war, where every nation raises and compares its customs duties on products originating in its territory.
The customs authorities, which led to China's early reward for the trade war, said American and Chinese experts to hurt Taiwan from countries such as Iva, who supported the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Bernstad, former U.S. ambassador to China, former governor of Eva for many years, and an important minister of agricultural goods to China, said that Big'ing was hurting American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Bernstad in Day I opinion in the "Da Moine Reg'ister" issue, "enhancing the acts of bullying by publishing ads in our free press".
In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses America's tradition of freedom of speech and precious press, and publishes an ad on payment in Da Main Register, wrote Bernstad.
And against that, in the press stand on Big'ing Street, you'll find a few opposing voices and not see any real reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have on the disturbing economic course, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish”, although he did not mention it in any newspaper.
The Republican Party is moving women's voices before the middle of the Academy with the Quano incident, warning analysts.
While many of the presidents of the Republican Party stand by and defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, Bert Kuano, in the face of a number of charges of sexual assault, analysts warned that they would see an adverse reaction, especially from women, during the upcoming middle-school elections.
The feelings around the matter were very real, and most Republicans officially expressed their desire to move forward in the voting process.
“It is not possible to reverse this kind of stuff”, said Grant Rehrecht, a professor of state science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Rehre said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flick's recent efforts to open an investigation by the FBI would suffice to make angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday -- they are not going to forget it tomorrow nor November," she said on the day and day, "Carin Z'an-Pierre, senior and senior national consultant of MoveOn, according to the newspaper Washington, D.C."
On the morning of November, when we showed up in the Senate corridor, when the Republicans in power on the Senate Judicial Committee chose to continue to promote the appointment of Kavannu, despite Dr. Christine Blaise Ford's testimony, according to a report from the Mic website.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation levels will break new features," said Stu Rottenberg, a non-party political analyst.
People say they were already tall; they're right.
But they can be higher, especially in the midst of women's whistling voices and young voters, between ages 18 and 29, who, despite their lack of appreciation for the President, often refrain from voting."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which cleared charges regarding the sexual assault of the High Court candidate, the analysts claimed that a counter-reaction might be possible if the Republicans continued to promote the approval of the appointment.
“The designation caused the Republicans to have a serious difficulty”, said Michael Steele, chairman of the former National Republican Commission, early last week, reporting the NBC News Channel.
“It is not only the vote of the committee, the final vote, or the appointment of Quano, but also the way in which the Republicans handled it and the way in which they dealt with it,” he referred to the news channel G Cecil, the director of Prioritius USA, a group that assisted in the selection of democratics.
However, it seems that the Americans have a somewhat different view of the extent of their faith in the testimony of Ford and Koano, with a slightly higher support in Ford.
Yougov's latest survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believed for sure or most likely for Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed for sure or most likely for Kavannu.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that Kavannu lied with certainty or likely during his testimony, while only 30 percent said it about Ford.
After pressure from Felix, the FBI is currently investigating the charges raised by Ford, as well as the charges raised by at least one other complainant, Bees Ramirez, according to the Guardian newspaper reports.
Ford testified a week before the Senate Legal Committee last week that Kavano attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court exposed his genitalia to her during a party during their school term at Yale University in the 1980s.
The global Internet developer plans to start a new Internet to beat Google and Facebook.
Tim Bernards Lee, a global Internet developer, is launching a Start-Ap company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of the man who became a legend in the world of technology, is a company that opens Solid, the open code platform of Berners Lee.
Solid platform allows users to choose where to store their data and who people to access the different types of data.
In an exclusive interview to Fast Company, Bernards Lee was joking that behind Inrupt is a "world control".
"We have to do this now," he said about the Start-up.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create a personal database or POS.
The database could include a contact list, lists of operations to perform, timetable, music library and other personal and professional tools.
Imagine Google Drive, Microsoft Outlock, Sluck and Sputiffie will all be available in one hand, at the same time.
What unites the personal database is that the user only decides who can access the information and what kind of information you can access.
The company calls this "personal strength through data".
According to John Bruce, the director of the company, Inrupt is meant to find the resources, processes, and capabilities that are suitable to assist in the Slide attack for all.
Today, the company includes Bernards Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of several developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer code programmers.
Starting this week, world-wide technology developers can create visible applications through the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Bernards Lee said that he and his team were not discussing Facebook and Google about their agreement or refusal to bring about a complete change, which would cause a total reverse and a son at night in all their business models.
We're not asking them for permission.
At a post published in Media on Saturday, Bernards Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is "to provide commercial energy and environmental systems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid".
In 1994, Bernards Lee changed the web page when they set up the network's installation organization, W3C at the Metzchet's Technology Institute.
In the last few months, Bernards Lee has had a voice that has had an effect in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during Inrupt's silence, Bernards-Lei will continue to serve as the founder and director of the W3C Foundation, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm particularly optimistic about the next age of the network", said Bernards Lee.
Bernard Van: An event to mark the religious man who won the Victoria Cross during World War I
The only man of the Church of England who, as a warrior, won Victoria’s cross during World War I was marked by an event that took place in his hometown, 100 years after the victory.
Lieutenant General Bernard Van won the Victoria Cross on September 29, 1918, for his involvement in an attack on Belenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had won the highest British honour.
The stone of victory was exposed by two of his grandsons, in a parade in the North Hampton County on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that the discovery of the stone was exactly 100 after his grandfather won the honour of being a remarkable symbol.
According to the London Gazett newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant General Van led his battalion and crossed the San Kent canal "a heavy fog road and a heavy ass fire from a field gun and under a gun".
Then he rushed the fire line and led the line forward before we forced ourselves to take hold of a sub-gun and dropped three of the party.
Lieutenant General Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - one month before the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Van said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can't compare to, but something that makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also threw a stranger after the parade, which led to the Brentwood Royal Youth Orchestra.
Michael Van said he was "highly respected to take part in the parade" and added "the power of a real hero is demonstrated by the support given to many people".
The combined art fans of fighting stayed up all night to watch Lator 206, and instead they got Pepe Paige.
Imagine that you've been up all night to watch Walter 206's stubbornness and eventually to watch the main event have failed you.
The plan for San José included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and a live broadcast during the night on British Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Jared Mussey and Rory McDonald were ready for battle, British viewers remained shocked when the coverage changed to Pope Paige.
Some of them were not impressed with the change after they stayed up until the early morning hours to watch the battle.
One fan described on Twitter the transition to a film that's been painted for children as a sort of sick joke.
“It's about a government arrangement that is scheduled to take place at 6:00 a.m., the original contents were not suitable, so they had to go through the children's plans”, said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of marketing and communications in the lottery, when asked about the transmission.
"Pippa pyg," yeah.
President Balator, Scott Coker, said they were going to work on their schedules to include the future British viewers.
"I think when I think about the re-transmission, I think we can probably figure it out," said Coker.
But it's 6:00 a.m. on day one there and we can't solve the problem until day one in our time zone, that's day in their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, at the time of the transition, a lot of text messages were exchanged between the parties and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it. We thought it was a technical hit.
But no, it was a government problem.
I can assure you next time it's not gonna happen.
We only clean five fights in six places -- like we usually do -- we tried to give the fans more and just overstated.
It's a matter of unlucky."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt comfortable 'cause of his sexual orientation
Tom Daily, the Olympic jumper to the water, said that during his adolescence he felt inferior to all others because of his sexual orientation -- but that feeling gave him the motivation to make a success.
The 24-year-old jumper said he didn't know until he got to the middle school that "not everyone like me."
In an interview that was given on the Désert Island Discs, the 4th Radio Channel, under Lauren Lawn, he said that he expressed himself on the subject of homosexual rights to give hope to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympic games.
The usual host of the old show, Christy Young, went on a several-month-old disease leave.
In his appearance as Leonard's first planet, Daily said that he felt that the others would then be moved when he grew up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, the sense of inferiority and the feeling of different, there were real things that gave me power and power and allowed me to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so that he wouldn't let everyone down when he finally found out what his sexual orientation was.
The man who won the Olympic Hard Medal twice became a dedicated leader of the U.S. community campaign and used his participation in the British People's Games in Australia this year to call on other countries to grant legal status to homosexuals.
He expressed himself openly because he felt lucky to be given the opportunity to live open and without consequences and wanted to give others a “hope. ”
The World Cup Triangle winner said that falling in love with a man, creating the American film Dustin Lance Black, which he met in 2013, would catch me by surprise.
Daily married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than him last year, but he said that the gulf was never a problem.
"When you're so young," he said that it was hard to find someone his age who had similar heights and descents for the first time at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple became parents in June, a white named Robert Ray Black Daily, and Daily said that his "every point of view" had changed.
If you were to ask me last year, it's all round I have to win the gold medal, he said.
"You know what, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Golden medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with cancer.
Daily said his father didn't get the fact that he was about to die and that one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 Olympic Games in London -- because he wanted to be in the front row.
I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be here to be first line dad," he said.
"I held his hand while his breath stopped, and only when he stopped breathing really and died did I finally know that he wasn't defeated," he said.
A year later, Dale chose the 2012 Olympic Games and won the Red medal.
"I just knew I'd been dreaming about it for the rest of my life -- sneaking in front of a home audience in the Olympic games, it didn't feel any better than that," he said.
That's also what inspired him to choose his first song -- Proud of the "Three Small" -- that he identified during the preparation for the Olympic games and still makes him a duck.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC 4 on Day 1 at 11:15, according to the British summer clock.
Michaelson was disappointed in the performance and went down to the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American golf player Phil Michaelson will set a record on day one when he plays for the 47th time at the Ryder Cup, but he'll have to upgrade the performance so that the event doesn't become a sad sign.
Michaelson, who participated in the 12th anniversary and determined a record, went down to the bench at the decision of Jim Fiorrick during the football games and the two football games on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he was used to playing games with the United States team, Michaelson, who won five times at the Major's Tourist, spent half the day encouraging and the second half working on his side of the game, hoping to fix the patient who suffered.
So 48-year-old Michaelson is not the ideal choice for La golf National, where the long grass tracks are not usually forgiven for misbehavior.
And if the competition itself is not sufficiently refreshing, Michaelson, at the ninth game on Day I, has opposed the exact British champion, Francesco Molinari, who cooperated with the starting player Tommy Fletwood and won all four of their games this week.
If the desire of the Americans, who lost four points at the start of the 12 single games, were to succeed in the first phase, Michaelson's game could be decisive.
Porrick expressed confidence in his player, though we didn't expect him to say anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, dug me on my back, put his arm around me, and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Firrick.
He has a lot of confidence.
He was a member of the Hall of Glory and added a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's how it evolved and that's how we thought we should go on.
He wanted to be on track, just like all the other players."
Michaelson will break Nick Paldo's record with the highest number of games in Ryder Cup on Day One.
That might end his career at the Ryder Cup, which would never really match his personal record peaks.
Michaelson's prize stands for 18 wins, 20 losses and seven skirts, although Viorique said that his presence added certain intangible advantages to the team.
"He's amusing, scrutinizing, sneezing, he likes to make fun of people, and fun to be with him in the dressing room," he explained.
I think the younger players also enjoyed having fun with him this week, and it was nice to see that.
There's a lot beyond the game itself."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great advantage may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from a significant success experience before the last day in the only Rider Cup games may change badly.
The Danish player started his career in Waldrama in 1997, when his fellow player, Grandpa Bellstros, had a five-point advantage over the Americans, which he lost when he crossed the finish line with a minor advantage and won 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"I continue to remind myself that we had a great advantage in Valdrama; we had a great advantage in the Brooklyn game, where we lost, and in the Waldrama where we won but with a small advantage", says Bjorn, in the photo, after watching the win 5-3, at the 2018 tournament, they were on the day and yesterday, which led to the 10-6 La Golf National.
So history will prove to me and to everyone on the team that it's not over.
We have to give it all tomorrow.
We need to get on track and do all the right things.
It's not over until the coconuts are on the board.
We have a goal, and we should focus on it.
I said all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of those who stand in front of us on the other side -- the best players in the world."
Bjorn was happy with his players on the hard golf course and added: “I think I should never get ahead of the late in all about golf.
Tomorrow can be completely different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on personal performance, and it's completely different.
It's a pleasure to be on track when everything goes well, but when you're out there alone, then your full ability as a golf player is tested.
And that's the message you need to pass on to the players: you need to produce the best of yourselves tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving your spouse behind and he has to produce the best of his own."
Contrary to Bjorn, the captain of the match, Jim Fiorrick, would expect a better personal performance than his players, compared with their performance in the match games, except Jordan Speth and Christine Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Viorique himself knows both the winning side and the losing side, during the important days of this kind of tournament, after having participated in the winning team in Brooklyn before losing, when Europe's team succeeded in winning a miracle in the finish game, as documented in the movie Miracle at Medinah.
I remember every word and word, he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain, in 1999, encouraged his players towards the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but I want to succeed in the first stages, as you saw in Brooklyn, and as you saw in Medinah.
When this momentum moves to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We're making our own compound, and we're putting the guys up on track, as we feel, you know, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight and he will face Rory McLroy at the top game, with Paul Cassie, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fletwood and Ian Fulter, who are the rest of the Europeans in the top half class.
"I chose the team of players in this order because I think he'll be able to bring us to an end," said Bjorn when he referred to his only choice.
The arrival of the New Warship of Germany has been rejected once more.
The new German Navy fleet was supposed to be admitted in 2014 to replace the older warships from the cold war period, but it was rejected in at least one year, due to defective systems and low cost, reported local media.
The arrival of Rheinland-Pfalz, the leading ship on the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class patent line, has now been rejected until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper's report, a di citing a military speaker.
The yacht was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying issues after the supply shut down the wave of the phantom project.
All four Baden-Wuerttberg-class vessels, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-Class frigates.
They're expected to have had powerful cannons, anti-fly and anti-ship rocket batteries, as well as evading technologies, such as acoustic signatures, low infrared infertility and radar.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods -- you may be able to launch the newest items for up to two years away from home.
However, the meaning of repeated delays is that the new ships - which are supposed to allow Germany to send troops across the sea - will become obsolete until the moment they enter service, have made quite a quote.
The F125 F125 Fluck Beagle went to the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the vessels and returned them to Blohm & Vose in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had taken a ship and built ships after it was delivered.
Not much is known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media quoted a number of critical "programmings" that made the warship useless for the use of a battle mission.
The software malfunctions were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttenberg-class fleets would be operated by about 120 sailors - as half of the crew used in the older Bremen Class frigates.
In addition, a ship has been found to have a dramatic excess weight that reduces its performance and limits the fleet's ability to add future ratings.
The weight of the Rheinland-Pfalz ship is 7,000 tons, and it is twice as heavy as the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to the low-cost software, the price label of the project -- which also includes the training of the team -- also becomes a problem.
It's reached by rumors of a shocking rise of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) over the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that echo the newest drafts are becoming particular concerns in the light of recent warnings that Germany's marine power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartles, Chairman of the Security Committee of the German Parliament, confirmed that today, the Navy has been "the waste of ships capable of making a invasion".
The official source said that the problem had accelerated and intensified over time, as old ships had been taken out of service but not replaced with other vessels.
He expressed his regret at the fact that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class-type frigates could be scaled into the Navy.
Scotland National Foundation listens to the secret life of bats
A new research carried out at the estate in the mountains of Scotland reveals the way bats use the landscape to hunt their food.
It is hoped that the findings will reawaken the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The research done by scientists at the Scotland National Fund will follow up on existing bats and European bats as well as the long-eared Dovanton bats in the Inbreu Gardens in West Ross.
Special recording devices will be located on key sites around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
National Health Service (NHS) team and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using manuals.
Specialized sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat readings and who of the species is responsible for them.
Next stage, the map of the living areas will be spherical in order to create a detailed picture of the size of the viewer's face, of their patterns of behaviour.
Most of the mail, a naturalist for the national foundation of Scotland (NTS), hopes that the results will reveal which areas of life are the most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management work of the living areas, such as the creation of brotherly villages and how to best maintain forest spaces for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and across Britain has been considerably reduced during the previous century.
They are threatened by development and construction, which affect the preservation and loss of areas of life.
Spirit and light turbines can also pose a risk, and this is true of fly traps and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as home cat attacks.
In fact, the bats are not blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, bat ears are more useful in all matters related to hunting prey.
They use sophisticated techniques of DNA detection to locate insects and identify obstacles to their flight path.
The NTS Foundation, which is responsible for the treatment of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important genes and 760,000 acres of land all over the country, is very serious about bats.
She has 10 skilled experts, who do research, hygiene tests, and sometimes rescue.
The organization also created the first and only reserve dedicated to bats at the Ta'iv estate of Damprez and Gallaway, which is home to eight out of ten of Scotland’s bats.
The director of the estate, David T. Thompson, said the estate was the ideal territory for them.
"Here in 'Reb' we have a great area for bats," he said.
We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the right living areas.
But many things are not yet known about bats, so the work we do here and other assets will help us understand what they need to prosper."
He stressed the importance of testing to find bats before carrying out maintenance work within property, since the unintended destruction of a single colony could destroy up to 400 females and adults, and possibly even destroy an entire local population.
The bats are a protected species and killing, harassment and interference with bats or destruction of their nesting areas, prohibited by law.
Elizabeth Pearl, a Scottish officer at the bat conservation fund, encouraged the public to give a shoulder and help.
She said: "We have a lot more to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know what their population is."
Ronaldo cancels rape charges while lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine.
Christiano Ronaldo called the rape charges against him "Pike News", and said that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Dr. Spiegel, who published the charges.
The pioneer of the Portugal and Vivantos teams was accused of rapeing an American woman named Kat'ren Mirega, in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He suspected that he then paid her $375,000 to keep her silence about the incident, reporting Dr. Spiegel on day and day.
Ronaldo, a 33-year-old, turned to his 142 million followers in Instagram in video, lived a few hours after the charges were published and called the "Pick News" reports.
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said yesterday, Pike News, told the player's camera who won the D'Lonne five times.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy person and everything's good," added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Dr. Spiegel for the charges, which were referred to as "an unacceptable report of privacy suspicions", according to the Ritters report.
Lawyer Christian Schartitz said that the actor would seek compensation for “injurious damages in the amount corresponding to the substance of the violation, which is apparently one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the last few years”.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Casino Palms Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the Night Club, Ronaldo and Miragor went back, according to the report, to the player's room and the actor allegedly raped her analytically, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nuda.
Mygora claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told her he was a "good guy" in "99 percent" who was disappointed in "one-holding".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but they agreed.
Mygora also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but then she agreed to settle out of court because she felt she was terrified of reprisals and she was afraid to be humiliated in public.
The 34-year-old says she's now interested in canceling the arrangement because she's still suffering from trauma due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Rial Madrid from the United States at the time of the alleged attack, and he went through the summer to the Italian Yupentus Club in a deal worth 100 million euros.
BRAKZIT: Britain is forever sorry for the loss of car manufacturers
Britain will regret forever if you lose her position as world leader after the Brixite, said British Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that the British Toyota's interview to BBC, in which he said that if Britain were to leave the European Union without an agreement, it would temporarily stop the production at the Princeton plant, near Derby, would have been "disquieting".
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effect of the delays at the borders in the case of Brczeit without an agreement could go up the job.
The Princeton factory, which produces the Auris and Evantis models of Toyota, will produce close to 150,000 vehicles last year, and 90% of them will leave the rest of the European Union.
From my point of view, if Britain leaves without an agreement from the European Union at the end of March, we'll see the production break at our factory, said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Princeton.
Other vehicle manufacturers in Britain raised concerns about the indefinite departure of the European Union and how it would affect cross-border trade, including India, BMW, and Viguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it's gonna close its mini factory in Oxford for a month after the Brixite.
The main concerns relate to what vehicle manufacturers call the risks of the supply chain in the case of Brczeit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is run on the basis of "just in time", with parts coming every 37 minutes, providing British and the rest of the European Union, to produce cars at the invitation.
If Britain leaves the European Union without an agreement on March 29, it may cause border disruptions, causing the sector to say that they may lead to delays and inadequacies.
Toyota won't be able to keep a stock worth more than a day at the plant in Dresbyer, says the company, so the production will stop.
Clark said that Teresa May's 'chress' plan, which details Britain's future relationship with the European Union, is precisely equipped to prevent these border checks.
We want to reach the best agreement possible, as I said, not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to take advantage of the opportunity," he said in the Today program on BBC 4 radio.
“The evidence from Tiuta and other vehicle manufacturers is that the possibility of continuing to use the successful array of supply chains, which we have had to date, is absolutely essential”.
Toyota didn't say how long the production break would last, but in the longer term, she warned that additional costs would affect the competitiveness of the factory and would eventually lead to terminations.
Peter Cubalaris, who has been working in Bernaston for 24 years and serves as the president of the Unite Association at the factory, said that the union members are more and more concerned: "In my experience, if the jobs are reduced, they will never be restored.
A government speaker said: "We have proposed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union".
Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who depends on her, could be "repudiated another week" while the fight for the Supreme Court candidate, Bert Cuano, continues, said the White House on day one.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller, who investigates the Russian intervention in the election, links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and possible disruption of investigation by the President.
The gossip in D.C. has been a deal for months, asking whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General and endanger Muller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein Dan could carry a surveillance device to record the conversations with Trump and get the president rejected through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on the last day, he came to the White House, and according to the reports, he was about to quit.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for the day with Trump, which was held when Rosenstein arrived in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said it would have been better not to fire Rosenstein, but at this point the meeting was denied to prevent confrontation with the hearing on the Senate Legal Committee, where one of the women who accused him of improper sexual conduct, Dr. Christine Blyzy Ford.
On day and day, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the claims against Kavano, and rebutting the vote in the Senate.
Trump's spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on day one.
In answer to the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "We have not yet set a date for the meeting, it may be held this week, and I can see a rejection another week, given the event in the Supreme Court.
But we look and I'm always happy to update the press."
Certain writers would dispute this claim: There has been no press briefing of the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sunders said that the frequency of the broadcasts did not come from the "stopping position" of the TV articles, although she said: "I won't deny the fact that they're taking a stand."
Then she offered to increase the direct link between Trump and the press.
“The President has more questions and answers than any president before him”, she said, adding without quoting evidence: “We checked the numbers”.
Press releases are still in place, Sunders said, but if the press has a chance to present questions directly to the President of the United States, it's much better than to talk to me.
We've tried to do this many times, and you've seen that we've done it many times over the last few weeks, and that we've been able to meet with the President of the United States, to change the press."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open meetings or press conferences during distinguished visits.
Only his press parties are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have given the reason for this, with a release and a strange occasion in front of writers who have gathered instead.
The Health Service writes to European Union employees in NHS Scotland and refers to concerns about Brczeit.
The Health Service wrote to the European Union staff working in Scotland's National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and to request that they stay after the Brixite.
The Scottish parliament, Jin Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before Britain’s departure from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to holding requests for a fixed status for citizens of the European Union working in its abroad public services.
Ms. Freeman wrote in her letter: “In the course of the summer, the British-European Union negotiations on exit continued, and he is moving towards the expected decisions of the fall.
But the British government has also increased its readiness for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this period may be a very worrying time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to go back and say how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the team, regardless of his nationality.
Fellows from all over the European Union and the world bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and the congregations we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we very much want you to stay here."
Christyon Abercombi undergoes emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury.
The rear shield from the group of tigers of the University of Tennessee, Christyon Abercomb, underwent an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury from loss 31-27 on Saturday to the Commodores group of the University of Wenderblat, reporting Mike Orgen from Tanzania.
Rod Reed, Chief Coach of the Tensey University Group, told the reporters that the wound occurred shortly before midnight.
"He went to the edge of the field and just collapsed there," says Reid.
The trainers and the medical team gave Abercombi oxygen on the edge of the field and then put it on a stretcher and took it to another test.
An official from the University of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville Tribal, that Abercombi was transferred to surgery at Wenderblatt's medical center.
Harris added that "no details on the type/scope of surgery" and the University of Tennessee are still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercombi is an athletic student and this is his first season with the University of Tennessee after a transfer from Illinois.
He participated in five repairs just before he left the game, and he picked up his kit for the 18th season.
Foreign buyers will be forced to pay higher taxes when buying property in Britain.
Foreign buyers will be forced to pay higher taxes when purchasing British property, and the income supplement will be used to help homeless people, according to the new conservative scheme.
The move will disable Corbin's move to attract new voters.
The billiards charge those who don't pay taxes in Britain.
The treasure expects the tax to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have a higher rate of stamp tax when they buy British property - the income supplement will be used to help homeless people, announce Teresa May today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbin’s move to attract young voters, with promises to provide cheaper housing and focus on high incomes.
The stamp tax will be imposed on people and companies that do not pay taxes in Britain, and the revenue supplement will reinforce the government's move to help those who are old under severe conditions.
The payment, which comes in addition to the current stamp tax, including higher tax levels on secondary housing and real estate investments for rent, may reach a height of three percent.
The treasure expects the move to be held up to 120 million pounds a year.
According to estimates, 13 percent of the new property built in London is purchased by foreign residents, the situation that makes prices rise and makes it difficult for people who first buy property to set foot on the housing ladder.
Many wealthy areas of the country -- and especially of the capital -- have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy only arrives a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a drop in the stamp tax to help young people acquire a first home.
He blames large building companies for the cost of precious property, since they hijack land but do not use it, and rushes back May to abandon the coverings on houses at a reasonable price and repair Britain's "housing" of housing.
Corbin announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent control and a “free of charge” termination.
He also wants to give the Council greater power to build new houses.
May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my time to the restoration of the British dream -- that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build lives here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live in Britain, as well as companies based in foreign countries, can afford to own homes as easily as British residents who work hard.
The dream of becoming the owners has become too far for too many people, and the humiliation of sleeping under difficult conditions is too real."
"K Ross: My ultimate goal is to run Scotland."
The head of Sunderland's K Ross said that his "the ultimate direction" is to become a Scottish manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scots are fond of the life challenge of the North East Club, which is currently in third place in the first league, three points away from the pre-degree.
He moved to the summer light stadium after leading St. Meren back to the first place in Scotland in the last season.
I wanted to play for my country as an actor.
I once participated in an international game, and that's it, Ross said to the BBC Scotch Sports Sound program.
But when I grew up, I watched the Scotland team play with my dad as a kid, and it was always something that pulled me back.
Anyway, this opportunity will only come if I manage the team."
Sunderland's former directors include Dick Edbokt, David Moise, Sam Aldace, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Foy, and Paulo de Caniu.
The former director of Elea Attalic says that he was not afraid to come after such well-founded names in such a large club, after rejecting previous proposals from Bransley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, success will now be determined by whether I can return the club to Fermier League"?
Because of the structures and facilities at this club, he obviously belonged to the Farmer League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I can see myself as a success story here only if I can get the club back there."
Ross started his management career only three years ago, after a period as assistant manager in Damberton and 15 months as the Hearts team coach.
At the next stage, he helped God to get out of League G and brought St.
Ross says he's more comfortable than ever during his career in Claid, Hartelpol, Polkirk, St. Myren and Milton Academy.
"It was obviously a real intersection," he recalled, about taking the lead on Elva.
"I truly believed that the management position was more favourable to me than the game.
That sounds weird because I played all right, I made a reasonable profit, and I enjoyed a few reasonable suits.
But an actor's career can be difficult.
There's a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still dealing with you guys all about stress and stress at work, but management just feels right.
I've always wanted to run and now I'm doing it, and I've never felt more comfortable with myself as an adult."
You can listen to an interview full of Sportstone, day one, September 30, on Scotland Radio between 12:00 and 13:00, according to the British summer clock.
The perfect hour for Pinette Beer is at 5:30 Saturday, in the poll.
The rising summer heat wave of British puppies struggling for their existence, but it put pressure on the restaurant networks.
Groups of pabi and bar enjoyed sales at 2.7 per cent in July - but the incomes at restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent, and the data were revealed.
Peter Martin, CGA Business Counselor, who collected the data, said: “The meaning of the clear weather continuation and the longer- than-expected participation of England in the World Cup is that the month of July was a pattern similar to June, as the well incomes rose by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants suffered even more severe beatings.
The 1.8% drop in trade in restaurants observed in June just got worse in July.
Babies and bars focused on drinks recorded the strongest performances, with a higher increase in incomes in the restaurant business compared to the previous period.
Food - focused bars also suffered from the sun, although their condition was less dramatic than that of restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In the Babies and Bar Networks, the sales of drinks rose by 6.6 per cent during the month, and food sales had dropped by three per cent.
Paul Newman, from the RSM data analysis from the field of leisure and hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather, the effect of sports events or important social events are the most important factors in terms of the out-of-house entertainment market.
It's not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle, although a 48% drop in sales compared to last year would be particularly painful as well as for all half of the regular costs.
The long and warm summer couldn't get any worse to food-focused business, and the time would say if the more permanent temperatures we experienced in August were to bring out what they needed so much."
The growth in bar and restaurant sales, including new openings, was about 2.7 percent in July, and the slow pace of branding.
The monitoring of sales for the UK's Pubs, bars and restaurants, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyses performance data from 47 groups, with a combined business cycle of 9 billion lps, and it measures performance equations set in the sector.
One out of every five children has social media accounts they hide from their parents.
A survey revealed that one out of every five children -- only 11 years of age -- have confidential social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
Survey, which included 20,000 middle school students, revealed a growth on the pages of "False Insta"
The news has raised concerns about advertising sexual content.
20 percent of the students said they have a "head" account that they show to parents.
One out of five children -- only 11 years of age -- creates social media accounts that he keeps a secret from adults.
A survey involving 20,000 middle-school students revealed a rapid growth in counterfeit Insta accounts - as a reminder of the photo-sharing site, Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about advertising sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they run a clean "head" account to show their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother who encountered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found that she was asking others to rape me.
The study, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC of the independent schools in Britain, found 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 who have two profiles and one of them confessing that they have private accounts.
HMC Head, Mike Boknan, said: “It bothers so many teenagers to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them”.
Eileid Doyle will be used as "Voice for the Athletes" in the Scottish Athletes Directorate.
Eileid Doyle was elected to the Scotch Athletes Directorate for External Architecture at the annual General Assembly of the Board of Directors.
Deweyle is the cheapest athletic athlete and head Ian Betti described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who would guide the sports branches to benefit from the richest international experiment during the last decade.
“Eid was highly respected among the Scottish, British and World Athletes Community, and we are sure that the Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from your coming to the board of directors, ” says Betty.
Doyle said, "I am eager to use the athletes as a voice and hope I can make a donation and really help with the leadership of sports in Scotland."
The American, which won 200 and 400 meters in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, and only four Olympic gold medals, which is now regularly used on the BBC network, has lost its ability to walk after having suffered a transient brain stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time would say whether or to what extent.
It was a wild job, but I've recovered completely, and I've been re-educating how to go, and now it's a quick and rapid response exercise!
Thank you for your words of encouragement!
An ad for milk pumps comparing female cows' mothers to online opinion groups
A company of milk pumpes has a network of opinions with an awareness that compares mothers to cows milking.
To point out that the pump that is supposed to be the “silent and worn milk pump in the world”, the technology company for private users Elvie, is an advert for a humorist video to demonstrate the operational freedom that the new resource provides for mothers.
Four real moms dance in a cow barn with a bellful of songs with words like: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see a tail" and "in case you haven't noticed it's not soft, but my breasts."
The song goes on and says, "Piper, pump, I feed the babies, pump, pump, I milk my girls."
But the ad, posted on the company Facebook page, caused online controversy.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of reactions, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many said that it sheds light on the "freaks" of the dairy industry.
"The decision to use fruits to publish the product is very bad.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and have a baby to make milk, but their babies are stolen from them within days after escape," she wrote.
Elvie's milk pump integrates discreetly into the clean bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another reaction said: “Trumatically speaking, the cow and the circle as one.
But hey, why don't you use them to post a milk pump to mothers who have to keep their babies?
Another reaction said, "A commercial is completely off."
Others protected the commercial, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was a laugh.
I think it's a genius idea.
I'd buy one if I'd still be a mechanic.
The pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I was referring to its content.
It's a genius product," wrote someone.
Another comment said: "It's a funny ad for mothers who stay (often in their workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like cows.
It's not an ad that glories or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group finds that they were all dancing with the Discretionary pumps inside their fronts.
The idea that behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women, who use milk resources, say they feel like cows.
But Elvie's pump is entirely quiet, without pipes and wires, it is irresistibly integrated into the cleaning bra and thus gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even leave during the pumping.
Anna Blarin, a partner and head of the early development department at Mother, stated: “Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product that it has come up with a bold and productive drink.
In creating a comparison between women that express themselves and dairy cows, we wanted to place the milk pump and all the challenges it presents in the light of the sparks, and to demonstrate in a amusing way that it is identifiable, the amazing sense of freedom that the new resource will provide.
It's not the first time Elvie's resource makes headlines.
During London's fashion week, Mom took two kids on the track for designer Martha Jacobowski using a product.
Hundreds of immigrant children have been transferred quietly to a tent camp at the Texas border.
The number of immigrant children under arrest has been shaken despite the fact that the number of monthly border crossings remains relatively unchanged, and one reason is that the conversation and policy of the manager of Trump have made it difficult to transfer the children to foster homes.
Usually, the majority of the caregivers were immigrants without their own documents, and they feared that they could stay in the country as candidates for responsibility for a child.
The risk was a man in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other older households would have to hand over fingerprints, and these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Alvins, a senior immigration and security officer, testified before the Congress that the authorities had arrested dozens of people who had applied for protection for minors without supervision.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had not been criminal before.
Nearly 80% of the welfare owners or homeowners are illegally located in the country, and a large part of them are criminals from foreign countries.
That's why we keep chasing these people," said Mr. Alvins.
In order to deal with solutions for children more quickly, officials introduced new laws requiring some of them to appear before a court within a month of their arrest, instead of 60 days as acceptable according to previous regulations, report to the security officers.
Many will appear via a video conference instead of face-to-face to present their arguments for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for release will be removed quickly.
The longer these children remain, the longer they are expected to develop anxiety and depression, and the more this situation may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, the more shelter workers say and reports published by the system in recent months.
Counselors say that these fears are overcome by greater facilities such as Turnilo, where it is likely that the child's difficult signs will be forgotten, because of the size of the facility.
They added that taking the children to a tent city without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to separate them from their friends could make the trauma that many people are already coping with worse.
Syria tells the American, French, and Turkish ‘forces of conquest’ to retreat too
In front of the UN General Court, the Foreign Minister, Walid Al-Absolute also called for the Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Disappeared, also as Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally found on Syria, under the pretext that they were fighting terrorism, and were treated accordingly.
"They have to retreat too and without conditions," he said to the arrest.
It has been claimed that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to fight this sacred battle until the Syrian lands were cleared from the terrorist organizations and from any illegal foreign presence it is.
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly for training and advice to the Syrians and Syrians who oppose the President of Al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 warriors on the war-stricken country.
As far as the problem of refugees is concerned, he said that the conditions for their return are good and that “some Western states” are responsible for the “dispersal of unreasonable fears” that led refugees to stay away.
"We called the international community and the humanitarian organizations to help them return," he said.
They're doing politics for the kind that's supposed to be only humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no assistance will be sent to Syria's reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between the Assad of the opposition in order to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a border area in Idelev, from the last major rebel possession, has created an opportunity for progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented the large-scale attack of Syrian forces in support of the Russians on the province, where three million people lived.
However, the emphasis of the agreement was on “a clear deadline” and expressed the hope that military action would focus on the Jews, including those from the victory front associated with the Al-Qaida organization, which was destroyed.
UN Envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to meet soon the first meetings of a new committee, consisting of government members and opposition, to draft a post-war draft and pave the way for elections.
The Syrian government's participation in the Commission was not specified, and said that the panel's work should be limited to “the requirements of the current Constitution”, and warned against interference.
Why Trump Wins Second Academy
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers have apparently hoped, rejection and scandal would end before that time.
While there will be no doubt the most dramatic finale in the history of the Presidents at all times!
Right now, there are no signs of fatigue among the viewers.
Since 2014, high-level viewing has doubled to 1.05 million viewers in CNN and nearly sent themselves to 1.6 million viewers in MSNBC.
The average of Fox News stands at 2.4 million viewers in record hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nilsen, and the MSNBC "Richl Madow Show" came to the top of the ratings of the cable with up to 3.5 million viewers in important new evenings.
"It's the fire that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neil Bar, the actual producer of the ABC drama series, "the intended survivor", who deals with a state secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the capital.
Lalle Scobel, writing old comedies and counting only the funny parts... and a few difficult truths about the infiltration into the Hollywood men's festival... there's another theory.
She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
She asked.
He said, 'Cause he's funny me',' she told me Mrs. Scooble.
The chaos has a moral value.
Of course, unlike all the other TV programs, the desert lines coming out of Washington may determine the future of the Rue v. Wade verdict, whether immigrant families can unite again and global economic health.
Switching a channel or ignoring it is allowed only by the most experienced viewers.
And yet, you're breaking the limits of being educated citizens when you find yourself watching for six hours on the D.E.D. Post panel using Bob Woodward as a source of the "Fear" book, the "Fear" "Bombers" of Paul Manport's "Greeds" (the "Charm of Pride", according to the Washington Post) and the consequences of the humiliating descriptions of Daniels' stories on, and sorry for the expression, Trump's anatomy.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"A part of what he does, which gives a feeling similar to that of a reality show, is that he feeds you with something every night", said Bert Montgomari, CEO of the Welhouse Enterprise, and created the "history for sale" program, about the team that replaces the Trump show and the daily protests in the home (the war with the NFL League, the praise of Kim Gong-on).
You can't afford to lose one chapter or stay behind.
When I got to Mr. Flyce this week, he was clear outside with a temperature of about 26 degrees on the north coast of the island of Kawai, but he shut down to watch MSNBC, and recorded the CNN at the same time.
He couldn't hang up, not when Bert Kavano was ready to face the Senate Legal Committee and the future of the Supreme Court depends on the weight.
I remember the times when we made all these crazy shows before and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flyce told me.
I thought it was a joke, but apparently they were right."

External source funds predict the race for the closest middle of Congress
Not surprisingly, the 17th state of Pennsylvania is facing a financial crisis, thanks to the reorganization of the provinces of Congress, which led to the race of two congressmen on the same seat.
The District, a section of Pittsburgh whose borders have recently been reset, has placed the Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who has won his seat in another district, in special elections in the last spring.
Lombe ran against another congressman, Republican Keith Rut'fus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which has been heavily involved in bordering the new 17th district.
The maps were re-examined after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former provinces had violated and, contrary to the Constitution, had brought the results to the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a financial riot in the campaign between the financial weapons of the big parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory over the special elections of March, which were given extensive observation, for the 18th Congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The seat belonged to the Republicans for over a decade, and President Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political paraphrases have seen an easy advantage for democratics.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for support in China, and later retreated.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already met in Beijing, with a slight resistance from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos and Earla, in June 2017, and held a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled Trump's management team.
Foreign officials decided to return the heads of the American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama as a response to the "last decisions not to know more about Taiwan", said The Lord Norret, speaking at the office, in a statement at the beginning of the month.
But the penalty was imposed only against Salvador, which, according to the estimate, received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The penalties, which included cuts in economic assistance and restrictions on entry visas, could have been painful to the country from Central America, suffering from high unemployment and high-level murder.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials rejected an urgent conference that should have focused on safety and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year that was taken as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from arriving in the United States.
But in the middle of September, senior government officials made their wishes clear regarding the promotion of the conference, thus ending all sentences against Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pens is now supposed to turn to the conference participants, who are currently set in the middle of October, as a symbol of the importance that the government has in relation to, say the diplomats.
And three American missionaries returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new messages or severe penalties from Washington.
The White House speaker for Bolton's taste refused to respond to the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, and in all, two diplomats, who agreed to speak on the internal discussions, provided they remain anonymous there.
Their explanations were confirmed by an external analyst, close to the government, who also spoke out there.
Learning History
This is clear from the following report of Special Adviser Robert Muller regarding the alleged disruption of the investigation of Trump, whose ladies now have significant evidence in public records.
Muller is directing his investigation, according to reports, to the question whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in its attacks on our election system.
If Congress controls change, Trump will find himself judging and accountable to this body, just as he prepares to face the voters again, and maybe even to a jury.
There's a lot of questions that start with "M" and I don't intend to claim that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is it of the equivalent roleholders in Europe.
From both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect the length of time that may be spent in the struggle.
In 1938, German officers would have been willing to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West would have opposed him and supported him with support from the two sides of Mainkhi.
We failed, and we missed the chance to prevent the years of the murder that resulted.
History moves around such turning points, and the era of democracy that cannot be stopped, accelerated, or delayed.
The Americans are now facing several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who rules the fate of Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein's been in trouble since last year's newspaper reportedly offered to secretly record the president and put up guesses about his non-conformity to the presidency.
Rosenstein said the Times report is not accurate.
"How do we react if the F.B.I. investigation into the recently requested subject of Bert Kuano is incomplete or unfair - or if his appointment is satisfied with the Supreme Court despite charges of sexual assault and false committees?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of the school election and name a congressman who's on Trump the responsibility?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will enter a long winter nap.
But I believe we won't fail, because of the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish who was excommunicated to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, which had also shepherded my glorious home in the past.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light up Saturday candles on the same table on the hook.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorans from the Ring's Optimists to the Debate of Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are hosting Rafid Vina on Day Two, and you know that winning the Osters, after the impressive case against Virial in Spain earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to step up the G group in the European League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorans from showing up for the first time in the season until the 2-2 box with Viral, but he believes that Ring's could use this result as a leap for better performance.
"It was a good point for us because Viral is a good group," said the 31-year-old footballer.
We went to the game out of faith that we could get something and get a point.
We could have won at the end, maybe, but, just, his fix was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we left the freezer in the second half and were the best group.
Thursday's gonna be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it'll be a tough game because they've got a good score in their last game, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can push and get a positive result.
The last year has been really difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but there's a good feeling about the place right now.
The group's good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, put the last season behind and make it.
Women stay awake because of this fear of pension savings.
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, only a few people were talking about it with their family.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide Survey said they were talking to couples about the cost of long-term seasonal treatment.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family to take care of them, but they don't take steps to have the conversation", said Holly Schneider, vice president of the National Life Insurance Society.
We can do it next.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare the family for treatment unless you express your wishes long before the date.
Use the consultant and your family to discuss where and how to get treatment, since these choices may be a significant factor in determining costs.
Share your financial adviser: the consultant can also help you find a way to pay for the expenses.
Your funding options for long-term welfare may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a sum of money to help cover expenses, or self-insurance with your capital - as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: find an early solution to legal struggles at this opportunity.
Find out and get health care, a reliable man who will oversee your medical treatment and make sure that the professionals do what you want in case you can't communicate.
It was also considered to sign a power write-off on all of your money.

Sarah Flynn's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence.
Trak Pline, the eldest son of Sarah Flynn, the government of Alaska and the former vice president of the United States, was arrested for assault.
The 29-year-old Flynn from the city of Wesilla, in Alaska, was arrested for suspected of family violence, breakdown of reporting of family violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska police forces.
According to the police report, when a seller tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.

He's also guilty of B-type conduct, which could be punishable by a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.

Federal prosecutors seek the death penalty rarely suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York seek the death penalty for Sipolo Sejopov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal crime in the country since 1953.
30-year-old Sejov used the claim in the Home Depu rental truck to carry out a bike-track attack on the side of the West Side highway in South Manhattan, and ran a foot and a bike driver on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Sejov deliberately killed eight victims and deliberately caused serious bodily injuries, according to the declaration of intent to seek the death penalty, which was filed in the south quarter of New York.
According to the court's document, a death penalty may be imposed for these two counts.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury wrote a 22-page indictment, including eight counts of extortion aid, usually using federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, violence, and the destruction of preventable vehicles.
The attack called for significant pre-planning and first-time planning, said the prosecutors, and described the manner in which the attack was carried out as "low, cruel and sick."
Sipolo Habiblovich, Sipov, has caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angni, Nicholas Clabs, Ann-Lor Deced, Darn Drake, Ariel Arling, Hernan Prucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Penuco, were written in a statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the South Side of New York claimed the death penalty in the case occurred a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but he was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time that the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were convicted of contacting a spy for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years before.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Siobov, born of Uzbekistan, did not express any regrets in the days and months following the attack.
He declared to the investigators that he felt good about his actions, said the police.
Seipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to attack after watching the videos of Abash on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to the police, he also asked to hang a flag of Dash in his hospital room.
He claimed to be innocent in response to the 22-year-old indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal deputies representing Siob, said they were "of course disappointed" in the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to ask for a death penalty instead of a confession of guilt leading to life imprisonment without possibility of release, only dates the duration of these events for all involved," said Paton.
Sejvob's defense team has previously asked the prosecution not to demand a death penalty.
Parliamentman Marani says that he has to appoint Naig to Prague to be responsible for the negotiations in Brczeit.
Naig 'l Prague' pledged to recruit the People's Army today during a protest at the Conservative Assembly.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must feel pressure from the Russians - when a member of the Parliament of the Teresa May Party of Guards claimed to be responsible for negotiating with the European Union.
The conservative parliamentman Peter Boone said that he went to Birmingham, where Britain was already outside if Prague was serving as secretary to the Barksite.
But the challenge facing him is Mae, the highly divided lineage of the conservatives, met by the membership of conservatives who support remaining in the European Union for a different demonstration against the Brixite in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to leave her settlement plan, the Kress, on her way despite attacks by the Barksite supporters, the remaining supporters and the European Union.
The Allies insisted that she continue to try and reach an agreement with Brussels despite the counter-reactions -- and force the Aeropaths and the Lybour Party to choose between its agreement and its chaos,
Boone said at a meeting of the Leave Means Leave in Solihol that he wanted to break up with Kres.
He claimed that Prague had to be accepted as a friend and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we'd be out at this point, he said.
Congressman from Wellingboro added: "I'll protect the Brixite, but we need to break up with Cress."
He stressed his opposition to the European Union and said: “We did not fight in two world wars to be enslaved.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Boone dismissed the claim that public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: the idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is totally false.
The conservative parliament and supporter of the barquet and Andrea Jenkins also went along and said to the reporters: "I am simply saying, the Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The circus program is not popular among the public at large, the opposition does not vote for it, it is not popular among our party and among our activists who went out on the streets and chose us in the first place.
Please, abandon the chairs and start listening.
In a critical message intended for Mei, she added: ‘ The heads of government keep their service as they fulfill their promises. ’
Prague said at a conference, that politicians should feel the pressure if they're about to betray a decision that was accepted in the people's question in 2016.
It's now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political status', he said.
They're not going to let you get away with it.
He added, in a message to the enthusiastic audience:
We call on this country's people's army, which has given us the victory of the Barkazit and will never rest until we become independent, self-governanced and proud Britain.
At the same time, the remaining supporters walked in Birmingham, and then there was a two-hour conference in the center of town.
A handful of active people flocked to the anti-Brakzit sermons after the team was set up this weekend.
Lybour Lord Sires mocked at the opening of the conference for the security issues he suffered with the party app.
It's about people who tell us they can have IT systems and all possible technology to conclude an agreement like Canada Plus, to cross a border without friction and free trade without borders in Ireland', he added.
This is ridiculous.
'There's no such thing as a good Burkasite', he added.

Luis Hamilton ends with a world title after the group's dramas gave him a victory over Sebastian Wettel.
It was clear, from the moment Walter Botas took the next step before Louis Hamilton on Saturday, that the Marshads group was going to play an important role in the race.
The first man had a good start at Botas, and he left Milton almost alone when he defended his place in the first two rounds and invited Walt to attack his teammate.
Wettel went to the middle of the line first and allowed Hamilton to join the racer's tail, a decision likely known.
The Marshads team went off to mid-circuit later and returned to the race behind Wattel, but Hamilton moved forward after a close wheel struggle that ultimately the Ferrari driver had to leave the interior course to survive without risk after a double move in the third corner.
Max Rustafan, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back of the rank and was in the seventh place on the end of the first round.
He then led for a large part of the race and did not switch tires to get a quick finish and surrounded Kimmy Rykonnen to the fourth place.
He ended up in a middle stop in the 44th round and couldn't increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds when Reekonan took the fourth place.
It's a tough day because Walter did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me get around him.
"The team did an extraordinary job to get to Debel," said Hamilton.
It was a bad body language. Really?
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Finstein at a conference on Saturday, in connection with her insistent refusal to leak a letter from Christine Blaise Ford, accusing High Court candidate Bert Kavanno of sexual assault.
In his speech at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to the testimony for which Ford was given before the Senate Legal Committee, and instead said that the Senate has been the case, showing that people are evil, arrogant and liars.
"The only thing that can happen and the most beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see angry, evil, and lying people," he said.
When you look at the ads and the leaks and then they say "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Finstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... Did you leak the document-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
So, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak," he added in the Senator's imitation.
Finstein received a letter from Ford detailing the charges against Kavano another July, and he was released earlier in September - but Finstein denied the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't leak her story," Finstein said to the Commission, according to The Hill newspaper.
She asked me to keep him confidential and I kept the letter confidential as he asked me to.
But it doesn't seem like the Senatorial denial was accepted by the president, who responded to it during the meeting on Saturday night: "I'm telling you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she's not the [drilling], but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continued to protect the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, and claimed that the democratics were using charges for their purposes.
They are determined to return to rule at all costs.
You see the crimes, the scoundrels, they don't care who they're hurting, who they run to power and power," said the president, according to a report by Mediaite.

Analyst details the march of events the night a woman burned alive.
The prosecution proved the case on Saturday, at a repeat trial of a man who was accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roultt of the U.S. Department of Justice has been testifying for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phones records to connect together the defendant's movements, 29-year-old Quinton Tallis, and the victim's movements, 19-year-old Sika Chambers, the night she was murdered.
According to the Clarion Report, Roald said he had received the location data from a number of mobile phones who showed that Tallis was with Jimers the night he died, hiding his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went out to talk to Sanford.
Sanford came up on the stand and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tess had spoken the truth when he said he was with Sanford that night, Sanford said he was "a liar, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another mystery was that Tallis said he knew Chambers two weeks before she died.
Mobile phone records indicated they only knew each other for a week.

Another black man?
The New York prosecutor claims a couple for dismissal after a text message.
The New York prosecutor claims a couple for dismissal on the ground of darkness after receiving a text that was not meant to her by the complainant's complaint that the patient was another black man.
The couple denied that he was racist and compared the prosecution to blackmail.
Lynny Plasco-Flexman, if for two, expressed disappointment when she found out that her new childcare nurse, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived at the first working day in 2016.
"Laaoaoaaa, another black man," wrote Ms. Plasco-Flexman to her husband by text message.
But instead of sending her message to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, twice.
According to a New York Post report, after noting the flow of the mouth, Plasco-Flexman fired Mrs. Morris, saying that the former African-American therapist had done a bad job, and she was now expecting to hire a Philippines instead.
Mrs. Morris got paid for one working day and was sent to her house with Ober.
Now, Morris is suing the couple for dismissal, requesting compensation for $350 a day for six months of work and living in a place for which it was originally hired, though without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, don't do things like that," she told Post day and "I know it's dark."
The couple returned a war on the claims that they were racist, and said that the end of Morris' deal would be required, out of fear that they could not trust her after they hurt her.
My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," said her husband, Val Plasco, to Post.
But did you put your child in the hands of someone to whom you were rude, even if it was an accident?
Your soft baby?
Come on."
Palaco compared the case to "stealing" and said that his wife was only supposed to have two months before the event and was in a very difficult situation.
You want to go after someone like her?
It's not nice to do that," added the investment banker.
The case is still in proceedings, but the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple in social media and eliminated their conduct and arguments.
A new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington's light were afraid that readers would not be identified with a talking bear.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jenkle, who was born shortly after the book was received, said about the letter: “It is hard to imagine yourself in the place of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very amusing to know now what we know about Paddington's enormous success."
After she said that her father, who worked at BBC as a photographer before he was inspired to write the children's book from a little toy bear, was becoming blood poisoning about the rejection of his work, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book was "Mary-baby," after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of Paddington's success, which he described as a very important member of our family.
"He was a quiet man, not a arrogant man," she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a kid to get something: you're proud of him even though it's not really because of you.
I think he saw Paddington's success kind of like this.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always said it was due to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say hello to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was transferred to the hospital at Louis Pasteur 2, Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Ned called in a clean way and said her condition was really bad, not expected to last." Mrs. Ednan Lapros said.
And then I got a call from Mand where he said she was going to die in the next two minutes and I should say good-bye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The meds that the doctors gave her to keep her pace slowly disappear and get out of her system.
She died sometime before, and it's over. It's all over.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing it's all happening.
I couldn't take heart or scream or cry because I was surrounded right now by families and people.
I really had to hold on."
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laprus, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane alongside other passengers, who were unaware of the past failure.
Nobody knew," she said.
My head was a passport, and tears went down all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had a wonderful sense of identity with Ned.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women looting open signs on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide, working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humpres hung over a bridge in Welsh with inspiring messages and phone numbers to which people can call to get support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any other parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Davis, the 45-year-old, who lives in Bledney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone recognized him for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up every room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm afraid of a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis created the discoveries, so people would know that there is someone to talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still - you need to talk."
Mrs. Hampries, Mrs. Davis' friend for years, lost Mark, a life partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed or anything else, she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was in the bottom of the stairs on Christmas Day when the kids opened the presents, he didn't create eye contact or anything."
She said that his death was a tremendous tragedy for them, but they got over it: “It creates a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight."

The future of Bert Kuano stands at stake when the FBI starts its investigation.
"I thought, if we could really accept what was requested -- a time-limited and extensive investigation -- maybe we could bring the rest of the union," Flick said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee was "tore apart" at the root of the party's dead end.
Why were Republicans not interested in the FBI investigation?
Their alert comes from timing.
The middle-school elections will take place only five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans will not succeed, they will be very weak in their attempts to get the man they want the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to try to support Kavano, who worked at the White House for Bush and met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI takes out his report?
There'll be a vote in the Senate, where 51 republics and 49 democracies are now serving.
It's still not clear whether Kavano can get 50 votes in the Senate, so as to allow Vice President Mike Pens to break the tie and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserts in North Korea goes down under Kim
A number of North Korean deserters to South Korea have been down since Kim Jung-un took over seven years ago, said a South Korean lawman.
Big Sig Park, quoted data from the South Korean Union Office and said that last year the number of deserts stood at 1,127 compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the main causes of this were the more severe border criticism between North Korea and China and the higher the number of people fleeing.
Pyongyang didn't make a public statement.
The majority of North Korean deserts eventually get South Korean citizens.
According to Seul, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, where North Korea has the longest border and the same is easier to cross compared to the military area (DMZ) which has been well maintained between two Korean countries.
China treats Egyptians as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often turns them back in spite.
The North-South relationship -- technically still in the war -- has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks focusing on negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
The meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jung-on in Singapore, where the two generally agreed to act towards a time when half of the Korean island would not hold nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young-ho accused the sanctions that have been imposed on the United States since then.
Without trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there will be no chance that we will unilaterally break down our weapons first," Ree said in his speech in front of the U.S. General Arrest in New York.
Nancy Flossy calls Bert Kuano Historic, saying he doesn't fit for service in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Flossy, called the Supreme Court and said that his character did not allow him to serve in the Supreme Court.
Flossy responded to this on a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever appeared like that, they'd say "historic", Plussy said about her response to Kavanno's testimony to the Senate's Legal Committee on the day of the Lord's Day.
Qavano has strongly rejected the claim that Dr. Christine Blaise Ford was sexually assaulted when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanno was very emotional, and sometimes he almost screamed and suffocated when he spoke about his family and his high school years.
He also condemned the Commission's democratic interpretation and called for arguments against him to be a coordinated character murder and a Grotsky that was organized because of the liberal's anger at the fact that Hillary Clinton lost his election to the presidency in 2016.
Flossy said that Kavanno's testimony had proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it had shown a prior opinion against the democratics.
"I think he took a picture of himself with these statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democratics," she said.
Flossy hesitated when she was pregnant, if she tried to remove Kavanho if his appointment would be happy, and if the democratics would win most of the House of Representatives.
"I say so -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI then he's not fit, not only for the high court, but also for the court where he's currently serving," Flussy said.
Qavano is currently serving as judge of the Federal Court of Appeal of Columbia.
Plus, she has concerns about possible cessations of Kavannu against Obama's health reform or the judgment against Wade, since he is considered to be a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavannu avoided wishes regarding the possibility of setting aside certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"There's no reason for a hysterical, bribed person to come to court and watch that it's said, "It's not great," Flussy said.
And women need to use this.
It's an intense criticism, months and years of anger on his side, and it can't express them without crying.
"We're crying when we're upset," Mrs. Steinum told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's rare, do I?
She went on, got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager elsewhere, who said she cried too when she got upset, but she developed a technique and every time she got upset and started crying, she used to tell the man she was talking to, you might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears get the better of us as a result of rage, among others because they are not aware of what they are.
One of my most meaningful memories from an early stage of my life, in the office with most of my men, is that I found myself crying once in an inexplicable rage, and an older woman caught me back, it was a cold manager from which I was always a little scared -- and dragged me to the stairwell.
Don't let them see you're crying, she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they've been able to suppress you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was at the time a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his election to the presidency.
In 1987, when Art caught an extramarital novel manager on a vessel named Monkey Business and left the race, Schroeder, who was deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason she wouldn't consider the idea of dealing with the presidents herself.
She told me 30 years later and laughed.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another contender.
Someone called it "The Snow and the Seven Gumps."
Because she joined the election at a late stage, she joined the fundraiser, so she swore she wouldn't join the race unless she enlisted $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She found out that some of her supporters, who contributed $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
They think I'm getting a discount?
When the speech announced that it would not open up on an official campaign, the emotions surrounded it so much -- gratitude to the people who supported it, frustration from the system that has made it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexual darkness -- she was overcome by tears.
"You could think I had a nervous breakdown", she recalled that Ruder was in the way the press responded to it.
I could have thought I had taken care of McLinks.
I remember thinking, what would they write about my condition?
She cried?
How the U.S. - Chinese Trade War can be beneficial for Big'ing
The openings of the U.S.-China trade war were eardrums, and although the fighting is far from over, a tear between countries may be useful for long-term Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the opening shot earlier this year when he taxed important Chinese export products, including solar, steel and aluminium.
The most significant Islam has occurred this week with new estimates that have affected products worth $200 billion (150 million LL), actually taxing half of the U.S. goods from China.
Big'ing responded every time in the same coin, and recently raised the estimates by five to ten percent for $60 billion in American goods.
China has committed itself to getting a hit on every U.S. hit, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to give up in the near future.
A request from D.C. to return meant submission to its demands, but a public prefect to the United States would be too embarrassing for the President of China, Shi Ginfing.
However, experts say that if Big'ing manages properly, pressures from the trade war with the United States may positively support China in the long term, and reduce the inter-economic dependency.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the beginning of economic liberalization in each country is actually much more dangerous than India has ever seen”, said Abigail Grace, a research partner focused on Asia, at the New American Security reflection team.
Syria is ready to return the refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it's ready to return willingly to refugees and call for help to rebuild the country that was devastated in a long war that lasted for over seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations arrest, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Absolute said the conditions in the country were improving.
“Now the situation in a more stable and secure area thanks to the progress achieved in the war on terrorism”, he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by the terrorists to restore the situation.
All the conditions now exist for the refugees to return freely to the country they left because of terrorism and unilateral economic steps, which were aimed at harming their daily lives and livelihood.
According to UN estimates, over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Miss said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the devastated state.
But he stressed that the regime would not receive grant aid or aid from countries that have put the rebels to death.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Reider Cup in 2018 and defeated the U.S. team as a result of a final 16.5 - 10.5 track of La golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost so far six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again won the crown when Captain Thomas Bjorn's team arrived at 14.5 points to win the United States.
American star Phil Michaelson, who fought for almost all the tournament, sent his hit from T to the water on the 16th of Far-3 and lost the game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was a brilliant player in all of his rounds, and he became one of the four players who had reached 5-0-0 since the opening of the tournament in the current structure in 1979.
American actor Jordan Speth was defeated 5 and 4 by the lowest-ranking player on the European team, Verbien Olsen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's first-ranking actor, lost 2 and 1 Ian Fuller of England, which could be the last time he played the Ryder Cup.
With a pack of eight participants at the Ryder Cup, the Spanish Sergei Yo Garcia became the European player with the highest number of winners in the tournaments with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry but today I can't stand.
It's been a rough year.
So I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so glad to get the cup back.
It's the team, and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia emotionally after the European victory.
He's handing over the white to his country's John Ram, who defeated the American legend of Tiger Woods 2 and 1 at the single game on Day One.
"The great pride I feel to defeat Tigger Woods, where I watched as I grew up," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France and his record now stands at 13-21-3, reaching the end of a career Ryder Cup.
It's about strange statistical data from one of the best players of all times, who's won 14 important headlines, when he's only in front of K. Niklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find its way through the woods, except Patrick Reed, Stan Thomas and Tony Pino, who played high-level golf all over the tournament.
Captain of the U.S. Jim Fiorrick team spoke after his team's disappointing performances, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Well done for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll reorganize, I'll work with the American Professional College and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
We need to take the hat off.
"We're defeated."
