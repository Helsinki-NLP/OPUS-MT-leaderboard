AMs from Wales are afraid to "be seen as a fool"
There is a continuum among some AMs following a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This was triggered by plans to change the name of the Welsh Parliament Assembly.
The AMs around the political spectrum are concerned that this will make them look repugnant .
AM Labourist said that his group was concerned that "it has the same sound as Twp and Pwp."
For external readers Wales: In the language of Wales twp means a arrow and a pwp means a straw.
AM of Plaid said that the whole group was ‘not happy and suggested alternatives.
Reserved by Wales said that his group had an "open mind" on name change, but noted that there was a small verbal difference from MWP to "Muppet".
In this context the letter and in the language of Wales shall be signed in a manner similar to that of the letter and.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce changes in the name, said: "The final decision on any description of what should be called the Members of the Assembly will of course be a matter for the members themselves."
The 2017 Act of the Government of Wales empowered the assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that had broad support for the assembly to be called the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the AMs title, the Commission favoured Members of Parliament of Wales or WMPs, but MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
Apparently, AMs are suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching consensus may be a headache for the Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the way the assembly works, including rules on the disqualified of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on the question of how they should be called when they have a debate on legislation.
In Macedonia leave public opinion at a referendum on change in the name of the country
Votes will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to the "North Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia".
The popular vote was established with a view to resolving a decades-long dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbours represents .
The President of Macedonia George Ivanov, an opponent of the party on change in name, said he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the consequence of entry into the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells Stop Playing as the Churches in Harlem are sending
"Once again, the elders I spoke to said that there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's no."
He said he could understand how the bars disappeared.
He said, "People socialise differently" today.
"The bars are no longer the centre of local activity where people go on a regular basis."
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders think, "and today or tomorrow will end again where they were at first."
He added that churches can be replaced by apartment blocks with condoms filled with the kind of people who will not help the rest of the sanctuaries of the community.
"The great majority of people who buy condoms in this building will be a white carnage," he said, "and thus, they will not be sad when it comes to the day that they will be opened to these churches because most of these people who enter into these condoms will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by congregations of white carnage people before Harlem became metroles of white carnage people - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's ten years later.
The original Methodist Community of white carnage people departed in the 1930s.
A community of black carnage people who were practicing the nearest religion took the title for the building.
St. Martin's was taken by a congregation of black carnage people under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a baroque of retailers in 125 Street, a main road to purchase in Harlem, who resisted the rental to or the promotion of black carnage people.
Fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but as the parishes of Father Johnson made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor of St Martin's, was proud when he called Carlon "the bells of the people."
The expert who played the carillon in July called him another piece: "Cultural treasure" and "single historical instrument."
The expert, Tifany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that she was the first carllon in the world to have a musician of black carnage, Dionyo A. Lind, who went to the largest carllon in the Church of Reverside 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather said that St Martin's did not change with anyone else.
What happened in St. Martin's during the last few months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some introduced by the leaders of the lay church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The "vestry" – the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders – wrote the Diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "will seek to pass on the costs" to the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in connecting the experts and contractors who sent him from the diocese.
Some of the parishes complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The sea dog hurts a 13-year-old boy during a watch for the orange in California
A sea dog attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was waiting for the whale in California on the day of the opening of the watch, said the officers.
The attack took place shortly before the 7th morning where Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then went to a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that he thought for the first time that it was the excitement after he caught a orange, but then he realized that he was crying, 'Gimm me!
"Heid me!"
He cut down and opened the whole club," Hammel said that he realized the moment he arrived at the child's place.
"So everybody gets out of the water: 'There's a dog in the water!" added Hamel.
They took the child by helicopter up to Radio Children's Hospital in San Diego where it is in critical condition.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said in a meeting with the media that a shark was heard in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the thorax.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Cassabold to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
The Sainsbory's plans enter the UK beauty market.
Sainsbory's is competing against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with surfaces similar to those of a ‘department site’ of beauty products equipped with specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial market entry in the UK's €2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of clothing and household goods decline, larger corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 shops across the country and the idea will spread to more shops next year if it is successful.
The investment in beauty came after the supermarkets were looking for ways to use the space on the shelf once used for TVs, microwaves and goods for domestic use.
Sainsbory's said that it will double the amount of beauty items it is offering up to 3000 items, including firms such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing product ranges from L'Orial, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have more space with firm areas similar to those in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch the range of its Botique makeup so that the majority of products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly required of smaller buyers.
In addition, the retailer of the perfume Fragrance Shop will examine concessions in two Sainsbory's shops, which first opened in Croydon, lower London, last week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food per day in local convenience shops means that supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to buy from there.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbory's, said that shops will increasingly appear like ‘departmentstores’ as the supermarket chain tries to fight against stores that subvert Aldi and Lidl prices with more services and non-food products.
In addition, Argos's business has been on the market since it purchased two chains two years ago, which says that it strengthened the sale of the merchandise and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to renew its beauty and library departments has failed.
Sainsbory's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the link ended after a fight on how to share income from the pharmacist's shops in its supermarkets.
The new strategy came in after Sainsbory's sold the library business with 281 shops to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million, three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury skin care firms including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business director of Sainsbory's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and sensation of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
The range of our firms has been designed to be appropriate for every need and the attractive environment and convenient retail positions mean that we have become a destination of beauty products of interest that challenges the old purchasing style."
Peter Jones 'highly raised' after that Holly Willoughby cancels an agreement of £11 million
The personality of Dragons Den Peter Jones 'very angry' after the television presenter TV Holly Willoughby cancelled an agreement of £11 million with the business of his life-style firm to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for the firm of household products and their accessories, Truly.
The business of the pair was compared to the firm of Gwynetth Paltrow, Goop.
The presenter of This Morning, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce his departure.
Holly Willoughby left the personality of Dragons" Den Peter Jones very upset because she cancelled being part of their business of a life-style firm making a lot of money in the last minute - to focus on its big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was "very angry" when the very popular television person admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his enroma business headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, whose new agreements - up to 1.5 million - meant that it did not have enough time to dedicate it to their firm of household products and accessories, Truly.
The business was compared to the company of Gwynetth Paltrow Goop and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of 11 million.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce that she was leaving with Truly, Jones left Great Britain and went to one of his private caravans.
Source said: "Truly was by far Holly's first priority.
It would have been its long-term future that would have filled it with the next few decades.
Her decision to leave left everyone completely surprised.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch had almost arrived.
There is a store full of products produced at Marlow's headquarters which are ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of This Morening's representative, which is found among the profit-making personalities of Great Britain, can mean a cost of millions for the company due to large investment in textile products and candles to clothes and household products, and the potential for further delay until its launch.
And it can mean an end to a long friendship.
Mother of three children, Willoughby and her family Dan Baldwin have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as Chairman Chairman in March.
The two couples fly together and Jones has a 40 per cent share in the Baldwin television production company.
Willoughby shall become an ambulatory of the firm of M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as a representative of I'm A Celbrity of ITV.
Yesterday evening, a source near Jones said "We don't comment on his economic affairs."
Hard meeting 'but then we found love'
He commented on the criticism he will gain from the news media for making a comment that some people consider "non-presiding" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump surrendered so much?
Trump said with a voice imitating that of a "new news presenter".
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump celebrated that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards North Korea's denuclearisation.
But denuclearisation negotiations have ceased.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's best diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders, on Saturday, at the General Assembly, that North Korea did not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to the early steps of North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, it noted that the US is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech of manifestation.
He said, "We're doing well with North Korea."
"We were going to enter a war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have this very good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results – the end of rocket tests, aid in the release of obstacles and the return of the remaining American veterinarians.
And he defended his unusual approach while talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter this people-filled arena, we had about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing at the crowd directly before him.
Tsunamis and Terremot in Indonesia Destroying Island, Killing Hundreds of People
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not required.
Even after more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had to move from their home, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalysing international aid.
" Unfortunately, in many cases, it was very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, thus challenging," said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organising a team to travel to Palu, it is not clear whether foreign staff can operate on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the speaker of the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Pallu to see whether international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Given the earthquakes that often occur in Indonesia, the country is still poorly prepared for the great anger of nature.
While a tsunami shelter was built in Aceh, you do not see them very far along the coast.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Pallu, despite issuing a warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of times, travel between the numerous islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship was posted in Lombok to care for the victims on its way to Palu, but it will last at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improvements in the infrastructure falling in pieces of Indonesia, the centre of his electoral campaign, and spent a lot of money on roads and trains.
But Mr. Yoko's administration sent for the lack of funds as he faced his election again next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from ongoing sectoral tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of this faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to move from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the road, using ‘machetes’, bows and arrows and other types of weapons.
See: Daniel Riverge of Liverpool brings the same points in the last minute vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturge saved Riverpool from a loss in the Premier League against Chelsea with ‘goal’ at 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturge received the ball from Sherdan Shaqiri while it was 27 metres away from the rod of Shelsea with his team losing 1-0.
Hit the ball a little to his left before shooting the ball into the blast.
The ball went up most of the box as it ended up at the top right of the net.
Eventually, the ball fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga, which jumped to try to meet him, and fell into the net.
"I was trying to get into that position, to get in to the ball and players like Shaq always send it as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturge told LivpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming on me and I touched the ball once and I didn't think much about it and I tried to shoot the ball."
Chelsea was winning 1-0 to half the game after they brought 'goal' in 25 minutes from the very good Belgian player Eden Hazard.
The Chelsea sticker distributed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before leaving for the middle of the grand and then quickly entered the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly split the ball in the middle of the grand.
Then shoot the ball in a very nice way, which led the Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran more than the defence players and sent the ball into the net with the left foot and passed from where Allison Becker of Liverpool.
Leverpool fights against Napoli at the stage of the Champones League groups on the 3rd afternoon of the following Wednesday in Stadio San Paulo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videotone in the EUFA Europa League on the 3rd afternoon next Thursday in London.
The number of deaths in the tsunami of Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths in Indonesia's tsunami rose to 832, said the country's disaster agency early on Sunday.
Many people were reportedly trapped under the breakdown of the building that had fallen due to the 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet high, said a speaker by the agency Sutopo Puro Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was filled with debris from the fallen building.

Cromwell's Parliament's status becomes the last monument affected by the argument on ‘re-writing of history’.
Its removal would be an appropriate form of justice for destruction similar to that of the Taliban, of many of the English religious and cultural artefacts carried out by its fanatic “Puritan” followers.
But the Cromwell Society has described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "amendment" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate on the removal of the statuses that the Oliver Cromwell figure outside Westminster's Palace would become a target.
The British civil war’s ‘iconoclasm’ was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the evil Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his Thomas anthenat in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of a 19th-century opinion and part of the widely believed figure history.
Mr Goldsmeth told the Sunday Telegraf: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a champion of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-conflict of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure that is recognised as representing one side of that divide.
His achievements as a 'Lord Protector' also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
Sorrow Killer Attacks and Kills Chinese Slaves
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in south-western China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his name "Yuan," was found dead with a cut-off, blood-covered arch in the market of Lipanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a ‘hoggery’ on 30 May 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
Supposedly, he travelled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yonan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered a door to the pig's hatch in the open vicinity.
He said that there was a pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had attacked and killed the farmer, according to the report.
"Wu cousins were bloody and mutual," said the cousin, who referred to him with his name "Wu," as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera videos showed Yuan entering the market on 4.40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about 1 hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was not of Yuan or of cue.
Market manager told the Evening News that the pig was shut down to not attack anyone else, while the police collected evidence on the ground.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking people have been previously recorded.
in 2016, an pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Masachussets, and the man was severely injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg kept a farmer from Wales with his tractor until he expelled his wife.
After the pigs of a farmer from Orgon attacked and ate in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba Farmer told CBC News that pigs would normally not be aggressive but blood taste could act as "cause."
"They're playing.
They're curious, they're very curious ... they don't intend to hurt you.
Only you must show them the appropriate amount of respect," he said.
The remains of Uragan Rosa will bring widespread heavy rains in the south-eastern United States
As predicted, Uragan Rosa is weakening as it moves on the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods around the north of Mexico and the south-eastern United States in the coming days.
Rosa brought an 85 mph wind, category 1 Uragan, at 5:00 a.m. on the east of Sunday, and was located 385 miles in the south-west direction of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is forming a "trow" on the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baija California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will start pushing a strong tropical humidity in a north-west direction to the west of the United States
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching 'trough' creates a severe rains in the south-east in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous rapid flooding, residual flows and possible valangi in the desert.
A strong tropical dam will cause rain rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in parts, especially in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
From 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially on a large part of the Arizona.
Rapid flooding is possible under conditions which deteriorate rapidly due to the widespread character of tropical rain.
It would not be a good idea to walk out in the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
A heavy drought can cause the canyons to become dangerous rivers and storms will bring many local winds and dust.
The ‘trow’ will bring some rain to parts of the southern coast of California.
A total rain of more than half a inch is possible, which can cause small spills and slipways.
This would be the first rain of their rainy season region.
Some spilled tropical rains begin to move towards Arizona late on and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more scattered later on Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rain spreads in Fourcorns on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October there may be some profound changes in temperature across the US as the Arctic cools, but tropical areas remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There will be a major example of dramatic temperature differences from the US Centre on Sunday.
There is almost a difference in temperature of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the coming days, the heat of summer will try to develop and expand again.
A large part of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a hot start in October at temperatures in the 80s spread from the South to parts of the North-East.
New York City can rise to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is approximately 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate high possibilities for temperatures above the US average during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen the hearing of Bret Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people saw the very interesting testimony on Thursday of the nominated candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused them of committing a sexual attack allegedly carried out in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political struggle continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming with shocking news of the last minute of Friday: an agreement drawn up by the Governor of Arizona Jeff Flick for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that it is 100 per cent certain that Kavanauh based it when he was under the influence of alcohol and tried to remove the clothes when they were a post-secondary school festival.
Kavanah, in testimony of passion, said that he is 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday are likely to have seen it.
The company was counting the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks which showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Box Business Network.
And Nielsen generally finds it difficult to calculate how many viewers there are from offices.
To put this in perspective, it is a similar audience size to that for the decisive football game or for the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaough, was at the forefront of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day's hearing, said Nielsen.
ABC was immediately followed by 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flick was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanauh, those who protested from CNN and CBS cameras were caught on Friday morning and were crying with him as he tried to get up in the lift for a hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He remained there standing with his eyes down for several minutes as he was being aggressively criticized, in a live broadcast on CNN.
"You're standing here before me," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to a country?
They said to him, "You have power when many women have nothing."
Fluke said that his office issued a statement and said, before we closed the lift doors, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcasting networks were broadcasting directly, hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance the Kavanah nomination for the Senate in full for a vote.
But Flick said that he would do so only with the understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the designated person in the following week, that the Democratic minorities have been encouraging.
Flashe was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the Democratic Governor Chris Cons.
After a conversation with Cons and several sats later, Flack took its decision.
Falke's decision had power, as it was evident that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
English Prime Minister May accuses critics who are "take advantage of politics" on Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused the critics of her plans to leave the European Union to "take advantage" of politics and undermine national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain Teresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview behind her on the front page of the newspaper, her former minister for foreign affairs Boris Johnson pressled his attack of the so-called 'Chequers' Plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that the Great Britain and the EU should collect each other's fees was "completely wrong."
Shooting on Wayde Sims: Police arrested suspected Dayton Simpson after the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspected gunman who killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on a second degree murder charge, said Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials issued a confrontation film between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered glasses from the field and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reporting to the CBS' affiliate, WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that they admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
Its bond was set at $350,000, reporting the Advocate.
The Coroner's office of the Parish East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report on Friday, which said that the cause of death is damage from a gun to the neck.
The department is lending credit to the police force of the Luiziana State Police, the state police crime laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area to assist in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU’s athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the enforcement of the law of the area for "diligence and the pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The attacker who was 2 meters long, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
It had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 'rebounds' per game in the past season.
On Friday morning, the LSU Will Wade basketball coach said that the team is "lost" and "under shock" after Weyde's death.
"This is what worries him all the time," said Wade.
Vulcan throws the ash on Mexico City
Ash being disposed of from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern regions of Mexico's capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the trailer increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring several sounds and tectonic movements.
Social media images showed thin layers of ash covering car windscreens in the vicinity of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geography physicists noted an increase in activity in the 45-mile (72 km) volcano in the south-east of capital following a 7.1 earthquake in the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The known volcano "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police have a conflict with separationists from Catalonia before the anniversary of the vote of independence
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors in favour of independence had a conflict with the anti-rebel police, and as thousands joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarisation vote on the coup.
A group in favour of covered-faced separatists who were held back by the anti-rebel police laid eggs and dust paints to them, and created a dark dust cloud on the streets generally full of tourists.
There were also small fights during the day and the police had to use clubs to control the fighting.
Over a period of several hours, groups in favour of independence were making "Not to forget, not to mention" fighting against Union protestors crying, "Spain Forever."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in the protests, reported in the local press.
Tensions remained high in the region that wants independence one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by Madrid but which is celebrated by separatists from Catalonia.
The voters chose with a big gap to become independent, although participation was low with those against the recession who made a major counter-voting jacket.
According to the Catalonia authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting in voting stations throughout the region in violent fighting.
Independence groups had camped overnight to prevent demonstration in support of national police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said that there was no hope in the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we lived one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw Mom and Dad crying with joy that they could vote but now we are alone," he said.
Despite having had a vital and narrow victory in the regional elections last December, the parties in favour of Catalonia's independence are sending them to keep the momentum this year with most of their best known leaders or in their own determination or detention and awaiting the process due to their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was registering the protest on his phone in support of the police, said that the conflict was caused by two-sided politicians.
"There is more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalonia leaders who is in prison prior to the process since last year's end, announced that he would challenge the elections of the European Parliament next year.
"By going out as a candidate for the European elections it is the best way to denounce the debate in democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car entered a house by force
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car entered a house in London more than once.
The incident took place in Ballyngard Crescent on Thursday for the break of 19:30 BST.
Investigator Bob Blemings said that the injury was caused to the grades and to the buildings themselves.
A crossbow could also be used to shoot at a car at a moment.
Menga's goal wins game 1-0 for Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first 'goal' for Livingston won the game
Livingston, which has been promoted, has salted Ringers and thus Steven Gerard has lost for the second time only in 18 games as a ‘club’ coach of Ibrax.
The shot of Dolly Menga's ball made all the difference as Gary Holt's side was equal in points with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's side remained unwinned once outside its grand in the Premiership this season and the following Sunday will play against Hearts, which first placed and followed by eight points.
Before that game, Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna in their grand in Europa League on Thursday.
While Livingston continues not to have a loss in division in six games, with Holt's main coach that hasn't lost a game since it came instead of Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against huge visitors
Holt's team had long been winning before he had 'goal', with the direct style of his games that was causing many problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but distributed the ball in front of the blast, then Alan Lithgow could only distribute the ball with a wide body after he swooped to get the ball from Craig Halket by the blast.
Those who were playing in their own grand were happy to let Rangers play before them, because they knew that visitors could have given them the problems at certain times.
And that was the way in which 'goal' was reached crucial.
Rangers allowed 'free-kick' to enter and Livingston took the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to help Menga, who touched the ball and entered the blast from the centre of the box.
Until that moment, Rangers were occupying the possession of the ball, but were finding the defence of the team they were playing in their own grand, non-pentible, and the 'goalkeeper' Liam Kelly did not have much trouble,
That style of games continued even in the second half of the game, but Alfredo Morelos made Kelly welcome the ball.
Scott Pittman was unable to find 'goal' because of the 'goalkeeper' of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow shot the ball widely after they shared another player of Livingston.
Balls were constantly entered the box of Livingston and were always removed from their players, while two requests for "penalty" - after Halket's attempt on Glenn Middleton's replacement, and another after the ball was touched by players' hands - were rejected.
Fenomenal’ by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in Arena Tony Macaroni
Performance and femenial outcome for Livingston.
For a man, they were excellent, they further exceeded expectations on this straight-up track.
The style of games and their staff did not change much from the return to the main fight, but the most credit should go to Holt to the way he brought the team together since he arrived.
He had a lot of heroes.
The Halket chief was very large in his games, by organizing an extremely well organised defence, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Warrall with seven eyes.
However, Ringers had a lack of inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at certain times under Gerard, there was a lack of good standards this time.
Their last chance with the ball was not good - once only they managed to separate the defence of the team that was playing in his own grand - and it is a sign for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the rating.
Erdogan received different reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) people laughed and heard blue as Turkey and Germany leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – with a view to restoring relations between NATO allies.
They did not agree on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne to open a huge new Moscow.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The Police cited security reasons to block a large crowd of 25,000 people from being gathered in front of the Moscow, but many people who supported him came close to seeing their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan - many of them Kurdi - also mentioned their voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome them to the country.
The protests against each other reflect the separation of a visitor who is a hero for certain German Turkish and believed to be an autocrat from others.
Road collision in Deptford: a cyclist died in a car collision
Ciclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a trafficway in Deptford, south-east of the city, at 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and attended the paramedics, but the man died on the spot.
This encounter occurred a few months after another cyclist died after he hit a car and continued to go to Childrs Street, about a mile from last Saturday's hit.
The Metropolitan Police said that officials were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and bus deviations are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officials are in trouble
Six prison officials were beaten following a disorder in a high security men's prison, said by the Prison Office.
The disorder started at HMP Long Lartin in Workestershire for the break of 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
"Tornado" specialised officials were introduced to address the disorder, involving eight prisoners and located in one of the sections.
Officials were treated for minor facial injuries.
Speaker of the Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff has been deployed to address an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of those who committed the most dangerous crimes in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received hospital care after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October anti-rebel officers were called to prison to address a serious disturbance in which the staff were attacked by the ‘poul’ balls.
Uragan Rosa Threatenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with Rapid Floods (Low Areas may benefit)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is likely to happen next week as the remaining energy of Uruguay Rosa moves from the west of the desert, leading to rapid flood risks.
The National Team Service has already established a rapid flood watch for Monday and Tuesday from Western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass through a straight line on Phonix on Tuesday, and it is approaching late Monday with the rain.
The National Phoenix Temp Service noted in a tweet that "only ten tropical cycles have maintained tropical storm or depression status at a distance of 200 miles from Phenix since 1950"!
Catrina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of 40 miles from the border of AZ."
The latest models of the National Uragan Centre predict from 2 to 4 inches of rain, with amounts isolated to 6 inches in the Arizona Rim Mogulon.
Other areas south-west of the desert including central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to have between 1 and 2 inches, with possible totals of isolates up to 4 inches.
For those at risk of rapid flooding, Rosa's rain can be positive as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rain is likely to be beneficial as the south-west is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the drought monitoring device, just over 40 per cent of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category,” reported by weather.com.
First, the Uragan Rosa route was led to the next peninsula of Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, who will be a very strong urgan on Sunday morning with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour, will be located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and will move north with 12 miles per hour.
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific and thus losing power.
Thus, it is expected to touch Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or early in the evening.
Rain in parts of Mexico can be strong, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"Total of rain 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to the north-west of Sonora, with a possibility of not more than 10 inches," reported by Weather.com.
Rosa will then move north around Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at Arizona's border in the early morning hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move from Arizona and south of Utah until late on Tuesday evening.
"The main hazard expected from Rosa or its remains is a very severe drought in Baja California, in the north-west of Sonora, and in the south-west of the United States," they said by the National Centre of Uragans.
This rain is expected to produce life-threatening rapid flooding and erosion flows in deserts, and valangi in mountain terrain.
Assault in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested after murder attempts
Three adolescents and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old teenage boy was found with knife wounds in Sommeret.
The adolescent child was found injured in Excelsior Terrace in the Midsomer Norton area, at 04:00 BST on Saturday.
Take him to the hospital where he remains in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the area of Radstock, Avon, said Somerset Police.
The officials called on anyone who could have a video drawn from the phone of what happened to speak.
Trump said that Kavanauh 'Send the red and anger' of the Democratic Party
"Vot to Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the merciless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump during a demonstration in Weling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanah “sent the red and anger” of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanah witnessed before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denied an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually attacked her decades ago when they were adolescents.
Ford also testified during the hearing about its allegation.
Saturday, the President said that, on that day, the "American people saw the glory and the quality and courage" of Kavanah.
"A vote confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of the most recent legal minds, a jurist with an improbable public service record", he told the crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the designation of Kavanaough whilst speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't contest, but in truth, I'm challenging," he said.
"I am therefore running everywhere to fight for very good candidates."
Trump argued that the Democratics have a mission to "resist and block."
The first main procedural vote within the Senate on the designation of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant to the leadership of the GOP told CNN.
Hundreds killed by the Indonesian earthquake, by tsunami, with the number of deaths appearing to be increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many carried as huge waves fell on beaches, after a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when a wave of up to six meters (18 feet) fell strongly on the ground at the time of the darkness, while many were carried and killed and destroyed everything that was in the middle.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5-power earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not rise to happen immediately and ended up victims," said Sutopo Puro Nugroho, the speaker for the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency BNPB during a breefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not appear alone, drew cars, logs, houses, hit everything that was on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled along the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before it hit the beach.
Some people went up the trees to escape from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evicted to 24 centres in Pallu.
Air photographs issued by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, self-locking bridges and falling and a water-circumvention.
Strong shocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated in the declaration that the energy generated by the enormous earthquake of Friday was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
They said that the city's geography, located at the edge of a long narrow beach, could have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels had fallen.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the collapse of a fallen building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the centre of the earthquake.
Communications "were completely sent without information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were going to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was strongly criticized for not informing that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said that the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In a video of the social media shared amateurs, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard shouting anxiety warnings for the tsunami that was approaching people on the lower road.
In a few minutes a huge amount of water fell on the beach, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not authenticate the videos immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a sharp cut-off of light which reduced communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The authorities said that the military started sending cargo aircraft with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuations still need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has only been reopened for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Pallu on Sunday.
The number of deaths exceeds 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While World Vision's staff from Dongala arrived in the city of Palu, where the employees were sheltering, they went through scenes of evacuation on their way, said Mr. Dosiba.
He said, "They said to me that they saw many houses destroyed."
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups started the unpleasant disaster relief process, a few complained about the fact that foreign aid workers with deep competences were not allowed to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and personnel abroad may only start if the disaster site is declared as a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
"There is still a disaster of state level," said Aulia Arrian, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can introduce international assistance but so far there is no status."
On the second night in Pallu following the earthquake and tsunamis of Friday, the friends and family of the missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles of this history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy came out of a sewage.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under crushing for two days near her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesian national team coach of Paragliding, had trained two of the missing paragliders for Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those caught in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
"As a top person in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon told how, in the hours following the fall of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated among the paragliding community, he sent out messages in a way, disgruntled, to Palu's competitors, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, marked only that they left, but did not mark that they arrived.
"I think that's what means the messages didn't arrive," he said.
Letlers take $26,750 while ATM was being refilled in Newport on the Livee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was refilled ATM in Newport on the Livee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Inspector Dennis McCartey wrote in the statement.
While he was occupied with his work, another man "was going to happen after Brink's employee" and stole a cash bag intended for delivery.
According to the statement, the witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities shall contact the New York Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rap canister changes his name to Ye
The Canye West rap cantant is changing his name - for Ye.
Announcing the change in Twitter on Saturday, he said: "The man who was previously known as Kanye West"
West, 41, was vaccinated Ye for some time and used the monitor as the title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change takes place before its appearance on Saturnday Night Live, where it is expected to launch its new Yandhi album.
He replaces the arena Ariana Grande on the programme that was cancelled for "emotional reasons," said the programme creator.
In addition to being an explanation of his current professional name, West before saying that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible means "you," said West earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with the broadcaster Big Boy.
"All right I am, you, I am we, she, we.
From Kanye which means 'the only one', for Ye only - just a reflection of what we have well, bad, what confuses us, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
It is one of a number of famous rap singers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but the year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brothers Love.
As one who cooperated with West, JAY-Z, it is also served with or without a single and capital letters.
AML Mexico promises not to use troops against civilians
The elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use a military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelloco Square that "will never use the military to restrict the Mexican people."
The troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when left student movements were being established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by granting monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more public universities free of charge.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
The United States should double the funds for I.A.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this area, says the investor and practitioners of IA Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after several parts of the US government made IA notices, even if there is a lack of a formal IA strategy in the USA.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be the first in IA innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the IA research budget would be a good start, as all other countries are far behind the US, and we are looking for the next revolutional step in the IA," said Lee.
Double funding could double the possibilities that the next major acquisition of IA would take place in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Supervisors: China, silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcort, is the CEO of Senovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent IA companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system which won the highest-ranking American Othello player, and subsequently was executive with Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch in China.
Lee recognised previous US government technological competitions such as the Robotics Callinge of the Advanced Defence Research Project Agency and asked when it would be next, in order to help identify the next questionnaires.
Lee said that researchers in the US often have to work hard to take government grants.
Lee said, "It is not China that is removing academic leaders; the corporations are doing so,"
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have employed people who inspire others from universities to work on the IA.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the US to strengthen their efforts in the IA.
He said, "I believe that the green paper should be offered automatically to people who have a Doctorate in the IA".
The State Council of China issued the Next Generation Artistic Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funds to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organisations spend money on US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artistic Intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and White House announced the formation of a Select Committee for Artistic Intelligence.
And nine months DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As regards the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in IA research.
In the meantime, US legislation which has tried to create a National Commission on Artistic Intelligence has seen no action in several months.
The people of Macedonia vote in referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia," a step that resolves a decades-long dispute with Greece that had blocked its membership offers for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour represents a possibility of ownership of its territory and has shown itself on its entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the population of the Slovak majority.
President Girge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and a boxout campaign raised doubts as to whether participation would reach the minimum of 50 per cent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote is read: "You are in favour of membership in NATO and in the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Those who support the change in name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to enter into bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of Parliament said that they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change in name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State electoral commission stated that there was no report of irregularities up to 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Giose Tanevski, 62, voting in capital, Skopje.
The PM of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zurica and his son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country which gives him the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, he was arming a small palk and preparing seats in front of the tents armed by those who will make a pool of the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we must enter proudly under our conditions, not by ordering others" said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If we are not accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that the NATO membership will bring the much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the great majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after voting.
He said that a result in favour of the change of name would be "a confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute said that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters will participate in the referendum - an amount below that of the required participation.
Another survey, carried out by Macedonia's TV Telem, found that 57 per cent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, participation should be 50 per cent and one more vote.
If the referendum fails, it represents the first serious blow to government policy in favour of Western ideology from the moment it took control last May.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, passes from all Blighton's defence to ‘goal’
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Breyton's defence at the Win-0 of Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his 'goal' in 65 minutes seemed very easy.
The attacker from Argentina received a ball from half the grand at the beginning of the sequence.
He left among the three defenders of Blighton before running into open space.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four players with green bursts.
Fight with one defencer before fleeing from much more to the edge of the Blighton box.
Then split the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English attacker touched the ball for the first time in the box to redistribut Aguero, who used the right foot to insert the ball at the right side of the net by passing it from where the goalkeeper of Brighton Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero is sending some problems to his feet," said the City Pep Guardiola coach to journalists.
"We talked about the fact that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We had the good luck of doing 'goal' at that moment."
But it was Sterling that gave the initial advantage to Sky Blues in the fight of the President League.
That ‘goal’ took place in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball very much in the territory of Bighton in that action.
Send the ball right to Leroy Sane to the left in a very nice way.
Sane touched the ball a little before he led Sterling where the blast.
The Sky Blues attacker touched the ball a little and entered the net just before landing into a territory that was not supposed to enter.
City will play against Hoffenheim at the Campion League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Necar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer must play in Spoiler vs. Rockies
As Nationals were eliminated from the possibility to compete in the decisive game, there was no reason to make an effort to restart.
But the player Scherzer is hoping to be the ‘pitcher’ on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that the Rockies have the possibility to play in the decisive game, which are in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West with one game.
The Rockies managed to get a chance to continue competing with a 5-2 win against the Nationals Friday evening, but are still looking for the first title of the division.
"Although we are playing for nothing, we may at least have the possibility to win by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be playing at the highest level of any point I can face this year.
What would you not want to compete in those circumstances?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but are allegedly inclined to allow Scherzer to be the pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start for 34 times, has had a practice session on Thursday and will play as a pitcher on Sunday when he is usually resting.
The Washington right-hand player is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 ‘stricketouts’ in 220 2/3 ‘innings’ this season.
It is therefore appropriate to provide for the establishment of a new airport in order to ensure that the airport is in a state of emergency and that the airport is in a state of emergency.
The President indirectly referred to the situation relating to the choice for his Supreme Court, Bret Kavanaugh, speaking of the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"In November, everything we have done will be threatened.
Five weeks from one of our most important elections.
This is very great -- Who I'm contesting, but actually, I'm contesting so I'm running everywhere to fight for very good candidates," he said.
"We are seeing this very horrible and radical group of Democratics, we are seeing it happen now," Trump continued.
And they are determined to take back power using any means possible, you can see the green.
It doesn't matter to those who hurt, to those who want to live in order to gain power and control, what they want, power and control, we won't give them."
He said that the Democratics have a mission to "resist and block."
"And I've seen it over the last four days," he said, and he was calling the Democratics "wrong and green and disgusting and dishonest."
He referred to the Democratic Senator classified in the Senate Committee of the Senate Diane Feinstein on her behalf, and received many negative voices from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Has the Document been issued?
Uh, uh, what is it.
No, and no, I expect, first of all, the movements of her body were nothing positive - the worst movements I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad group.
It does not tolerate the communication of its opinions.
When Momentum's activists at my local party voted to instil me, I did not take it very much.
After all, I am the most recent MP in a list of MPs of the Labour Party that was not positively welcomed - because we communicated our views.
My parliamentary colleague Joan received similar treatment because she fought against antisemitism.
In my case, the motion of conspiracy criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, historically, issues similar to those on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the majority of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Council of Friday evenings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the policy promise "more kind and gentle" has been forgotten if, in fact, it has never really started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged as to whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This began soon after Jeremy became the leader, since colleagues with whom I thought I had a similar political view began to expect me to change my understanding and take positions I had never agreed with in other situations – on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and, in truth, do not make any difference – I am followed by abuse of social media with a request to remove me from my post of MP, condemn the policy of the centre, and tell me that I do not belong to the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Yes, I know that I had a better chance than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who daily face much sexual or racist abuse but are never hidden from the comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this policy era is the fact that the levels of abuse have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad group and with any move of "uncertainty" or a change of selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
I have been given a lot of advice over the last two years which have encouraged me to keep my views to myself, so that I am not so vocal and then everything "be good."
But I did not become involved in politics to do so.
Since I was admitted to the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, inspired by the negligence of Thatcher's government that has left my comprehensive school class literally in a state of disaster, I have sought to improve public services for those who need them most – both as a local councillor and as a government minister.
I never hid my policy, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I say is that when the country is moving to Brexit that will harm our families, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in truth, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to work for you and I promise you that no amount of threats that depose me from my post or political experience will discourage me from acting on those I believe are all your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, which has not yet lost once, rises above the top of the rating
Two attempts could have changed slightly the result, but there was no doubt that Ayr had deserved to win this exciting day's game of the Tenent's Premiership.
Currently they are first in the classification, the only team out of all ten that has not lost once.
Finally, it was the top defence, as well as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities, which helped the team, who was playing in his own grand, winning, and the coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've had trials during our games so far, and we haven't lost one, so I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Giveing credit to Ayr, they have taken advantage of better opportunities than we have."
With the attempt of Grant Anderson's in 14 minutes, converted from Frazier Climo, Ayr were winning, but, a yellow card from the head of Scotland Rory Huggies, which was allowed to play the game from the Warriors, gave Melrose the opportunity to try and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's victory with 'penalty', before, in the middle of the exact game, made 'goal' and converted an individual attempt to 17-5 points for Ayr in the suitcase.
But Melrose started the second part of the game well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted from Baggott, reduced the gap by 5 points.
Then stopped the game because of a serious injury of Ruardh Knott, which came out of the grand on a strike, and as soon as it started again, Ayr continued to take the points after an attempt by Stafford McDowell, converted from Climo.
The head agent of Ayr Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and, once again, Melrose issued an aggression when they made an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, after a period of hard pressure.
However, the team he was playing in his own grand started to attack again, and when he was given a yellow struan Hutchinson card for the action he had done on Climo without the ball, from the line of the penalty, MacPherson touched the ball with the ground at the back of the advancing Ayr group.
Climo converted, as he did again almost again from the area from which the game starts again, after having picked up the ball that met David Armstrong from the box and sent to Gregor Henry, who plays with the side, to the fifth attempt of the side she was playing in her own grand.
The character of Still Game appears to be ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The identity of Still Game Ford Kieran appears to be ready to enter the hospitality industry after it has been discovered that it has been mentioned as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man who makes the part of Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC programme, who he writes and participates in with his long-termcomer Greg Hemphill.
The doo announced that the next nine series will be the last one of the programme, and it appears that Kieran is planning for his life after Craiglang.
According to the lists of official registers, he is the director of Adreftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the history, although a source of Scotish Sun gave a clue that Kieran was seeking to engage in the "business of the very well-functioning restaurants" of Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes that the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
Seafarers keep watch on naval headquarters armed with ropes and chains in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue ocean flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered by the motto: "The sea is ours right.
Recovery is a duty."
Around Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict remains clear – as soon as Bolivians are able to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is perhaps at its highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and sereneness, and of course awaits the outcome with a positive intention," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the CGI on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find, in favour of Bolivia's statement, that – after decades of irregular talks – Chile is obliged to negotiate and give Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's creative indigenous president - facing a controversial battle for his election again next year - also has much to lose in the Monday's decision.
"We are very close to getting access to the Pacific Ocean again," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court would decide in favour of Bolivia - and that a little change would have done so.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant Chilean territory, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the CGI judgment only arrives six months after final arguments have been heard, indicates that the case "was not complicated" said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert in international law.
And far from favouring Bolivia's case, the last four years could not have been helpful.
"The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
The hostile rhetoric of Morales has weakened any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile, at some point, will continue to speak, but it will be very difficult to have discussions after this.
Both countries have not shared ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, denied the idea that court decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a "extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the "an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular Latin American presidents – was using the maritime issue as political aid.
"Bolivia will never relinquish its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can trust the United States
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never dismantle nuclear weapons is first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri had spoken on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to fulfill their promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
It submits its comments as the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompeo, appears to have arrived at the resumption of nuclear diplomacy which is located more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
He says that it is a "empty hope" that the continued sanctions and the US's objection to a declaration that ends the Korean War will never force North Korea to give up.
Washington is concerned about whether to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang making the first significant disarmament steps.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is serious that renounces armaments that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompio is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows the latest collection of clothing for the sharp head which will appear in the main shops.
If you want to add to the collection of your hats or completely cover the sun, you can stop looking.
Valentino and Tom Browne designers revealed a very strange and large range of head clothing for their spring and summer collection in 2019 on the runway that won the set of style in Paris Fashion Week.
Very impracticable hats are very visible on Instagram this summer and these designers have raised their surprising creations on the stage.
The article that attracted most of Valentino was an extravagant beige with a wide edge similar to the feathers that fully covered the heads of the models.
Other very large accessories included jewels coated with jewels, a hat of harps and even ananas – but not designed to keep your head warm.
Two Browne also revealed a choice of strange masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Most of the coloured masks had the lips sewn together and were more like Hannibal Lecter than 'haute culture'.
One reaction was similar to the complete lead device with a snorkel and goggles, while another was like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue with this good style.
Those who follow the fashion predict that huge ‘bonnets’ just will appear in the main shops.
The very large hats come out after the release of 'La Bomba', the large two-pied straw hat that was worn by everyone from Rianna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The ‘cult label’ responsible for the hat that is not practical anything that has appeared very much on the social media has generated another big reaction on the stage - a straw bag containing almost as much as the wet-wear model it was carrying.
The dark orange foam bag, surrounded by a small raffle twine and a white skin grip, was the most prominent creation in the 2019 spring and summer collection of Jacquemus in Paris Fashion Week.
"I expect to see large hats and sea bags in the main shops for the coming summer – as the designer made a huge impact, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for very large accessories."
John Edward: Key language skills for global citizens
The independent schools of Scotland keep a record of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another set of excellent examinations results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), endeavour to provide the best service for students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalised school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain the subject of popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak a man in a language he understands, he understands with his mind.
If they speak in his own language, he understands."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examinations, we can see that languages are at the forefront in the classification tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages achieved a higher degree A.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a higher degree A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also achieved A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages are now, as a subject option, kept in the same respect as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 UK Employment and Skills Commission survey found that, for reasons given by employers for sending them to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to language skills shortages.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective employment opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Irrespective of the career of choosing, learning another language, it will have a real advantage in the future as it has the ability to survive such a lifetime.
To be able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the forefront of the competition.
According to a UK YoGoov survey of over 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation and, by 15 per cent, French is the only language spoken by a percentage of two numbers.
That is why investment in language learning is now important for today's children.
Knowing more than one language, particularly those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will learn different languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as the Mandarin or the Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages that can be chosen from them in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future.
It cannot currently be denied, in a global business environment, that languages remain very important for the future of the country, and this should therefore be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
The best son no fair.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Sunday LeBron will play for the first time with the Lackers in San Diego
The sports supporters of LeBron James no longer had much to wait for to begin for the first time for Los Angeles Lackers.
The coach of the Lake Wallton Lackers announced that James will play in the opening game before the start of the season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the amount of minutes to play remains to be determined.
"We will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of the Lackers.
The journalist of the Lake Trudell Lackers wrote a tweet that, probably, James will play a limited amount of minutes.
Following the practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games schedule before the Lacers season began.
"In this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself," he said.
Trump Demonstration in West Virginia, Youtube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of manifestations of the campaign tonight in Weeling, West Virginia.
This is the first demonstration of Trump from five scheduled next week, including stops in amicable locations including Tennessee and Miscispi.
With a suspended confirmation vote for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections as the Republicans are at risk of losing the control of the Congress when voting in Nov.
At a time is the demonstration of Trump in West Virginia tonight and how do you see it online?
The demonstration of Trump in Weeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET toight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the demonstration of Trump in West Virginia online below via a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for the nomination of the Supreme Court Bret Kavanaugh, which was intensified by allegations of sexual misconduct with an early confirmation vote of the Senate suspended for up to one week while investigating the FBI.
But the primary objective of this wave of demonstrations is to help the Republicans face the November elections to gain some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that these five demonstrations next week are aimed at "putting energy on volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The Control of Congress is so important for this agenda that the president will travel as far as possible to states as we approach the mandatory campaign season," he told Routers a speaker for the campaign in Trump, named after him.
A schedule for the Arena of Wesbanco in Weeheling, the evening demonstration can collect supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the Pittsburg media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump will have visited West Virginia, the state which won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate of the Republican Senate of West Virginia Patrick Morisey, who is losing the survey.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to boost the survey," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Rider Cup 2018: The United States of America Team determined not to give up while approaching Sunday singles
After three sessions on one side, Saturday afternoons could have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The rocking pendulum pendulum is a concept of fully invented sport but one in which players really believe, and never more than in such competitions.
So where do they say that's the momentum now?
"These were at the front with six points and are now four, so I think we're carrying it as a little momentum," said Jordan Spath him as he left during the day.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, four front points with another twelve to play.
The Americans, says Spethh, feel but have a little difficulty and have much to encourage them, not least the form of Speth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each of them boast with three points from four.
He saw it was accurate from tea to green and is leading by example.
That cry from the heart of a celebration continued to grow as it continued its round, making a crucial point to bring the fourth equal game when he and Thomas were two from below two.
Hisput who won the game on 15 was welcomed by a similar call, the kind that tells you to believe that the American team is still there.
"Vera must enter deep and worry about your own item," said Speth.
This is what each of these players lost.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points from Spethh and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flietwood, the uncontestable history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but sweet couple of Europe are four by four and are considered perfect.
"Moliwood" was the only pair who didn't score a bugy on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and 9 a.m.
That race, and the way their energy seems to move both to and from this life crowd establishes that they are the players who are offering a challenge on Sunday, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun falls on Le Golf National from Fliewood or Molinari.
Both preferably at once on different holes.
But here we are speaking of an early European glory.
Both Watson and Simpson Web were quickly completed by Sergio Garcia, the morning football hero, when he was put in a match with Alex Noreen.
Bogey and two times the front nine brought the Spanish and Swedish into a hole that they had never managed to get close to.
But Sunday, there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to see them closely due to peer-to-peer interactions, advice they give, advice they do not give and the way in which a strategy can be changed in a second.
Europe has therefore played better as a team and is at the forefront of the final day but this session of the Forums has also shown that the US Team has determined that some, especially from the US side, were questioning.
Europe front with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take good advantage of the final day of the Ryder Cup after it has been released from Saturday's football and football parties at the top with 10-6 on the US.
The inspired pair Tommy Flietwood and Francesco Molinari made the two-winning effort on Tiger Woods that found it difficult to take their score so far in the L. Gold National for four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, ready to keep the lost trophies in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American side that went bad at morning footballs, which took the series with 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the fursomes, winning two parties, but could not get to the difference in score.
The Jim Furyk side needed eight points from the 12 items of one player on Sunday to hold the trophie.
Flietwood is the first new European for the season to win four consecutive points while he and Molinari, vaccinated "Mollywood" after a sensational weekend are only the second to win four of their four opening parties in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After they dominated Woods and Patrick Red in the footballs then worked excellently to win the unpretentious Woods and the new American player for the Bryson Dechambeau season with an even more empathic score of 5&4.
Woods, who found difficulty on both parties on Saturday, showed occasional moments of brilliantness but now lost 19 of his 29 items in the football and the foursomes and seven in succession.
Justin Rose, a morning football break, returned to Henrik Stanson's partner in thehouses to a loss of 2&1 of Dustin Johnson and Koepka's Books - which are the first and third world class.
However, it has not come as far as Europe wanted on a beautiful day, with a slight drop in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spethh, a three-fold great winner, and Justin Thomas set the threshold for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They achieved a bold win of 2&1 on John Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the footballs and later returned to win Poulter and Rory McLroy with 4&3 in the Foursomes after losing both opening holes.
It was only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team returned from a four-point difference while it was entering the singles, although Furyk’s side holders need to learn to keep the trophies.
However, after being the second best for two days, a Sunday counter attack seems to be more than they can do.
North Korea says that it will not "no way" unilaterally dissipate without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations Saturday that the continuing sanctions were deepening its lack of confidence in the United States and that there was no way that the country would leave its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world's body that North Korea had taken "considerably good-will measures" last year, such as having set up nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site, and promised not to promote nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no way dissipate ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri repeated familiar complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearisation in which North Korea would have been rewarded as soon as it took gradual steps, its statement appeared significantly not to reject unintentional unilateral denuclearisation as it had done in the past Pyongyang.
He referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a US president performing his duties and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work towards "the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea was seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 War of Korea, but the United States said that Pyongyang first has to renounce its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls to reduce hard international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists on "first denuclearisation" and increases the level of pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their objective in a concerted manner, and even objects to the "end-of-war declaration," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can break us is a dream of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions are deepening our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If part of this issue of denuclearisation had been South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have led to such a blockage."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the United States continental land with North Korean rockets was inevitable after Mr. Kavit Trump called Kim "a man of rockets" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take steps to dismantle, but said that much work remained to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearised.
Wednesday, Trump said he had no time schedule for this, saying, "If it takes two, three years or five months - it doesn't make a difference."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey, Thursday, told the UN Security Council that: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council should continue vigorously and without stopping until we achieve fully and finally verified denuclearisation."
The Security Council unanimously reinforced the sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with a view to ending funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompio met Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly and later said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompio has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, after in a few hours North Korea criticized him for making "gangster-like requests".
In a meeting with Mon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the US takes "corresponding measures."
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard's students take a course on taking sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has succeeded in making all its students who have not yet graduated more sleep with the aim of fighting the growing macho culture that is being studied all night and being raised by caffeine.
An academic found that students at the university at first place in the world often have no idea about the basic true things about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after speaking about the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
"In the end she was a girl on me and said: "Why are you saying this to me now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - to surprise me," she said to The Telegraf.
The course, which started for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials on how good sleep traditions help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatric at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a classroom where students sleep, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to tell them the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance has an effect on sleep deficiency, and the routine importance of sleep time.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged insomnia may increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive themes, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the students' behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know - as much as you have a right to know the effects on health when you choose to smoke cigarettes," added the Czeisler Prof.
A culture that is proud that "you've been able to get up all night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that insomnia was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you sleep enough, and of good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of a student to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid increasing weight, since sleeplessness puts the brain in a hunger mode, which makes them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to persist for a course across the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students who have graduated to undertake a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider making an alarm for going to sleep, as well as for getting up, and know about the harmful effects of "blue light" arising from electronic screens and LED light, which can imbalance your circadian rhythm, and lead to problems sleeping.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga goal hinders Gerard's men
Ringers suffered another period of frustration when they played abroad as Dolly Menga's strike delivered the separate side of Steven Gerard to a loss of 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrax's side was looking for a record of their first victory while they were travelling from the February 4-1 triumph in St. Johnstone, but Gary Hold's team only caused Gerard's second loss in 18 items as a manager to leave his side eight points away from the major leaders of Ladbroke Premiersship, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time and the list of missing Rangers' players never appeared to be reaching.
While Rangers now go down to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third and only after Hibernian on a gooul difference.
And there may be more trouble for Rangers after the lineman House Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently throwing an object on the side of the team's supporters who played abroad.
Gerard made eight changes in the past side of Ayr to the semi-finishes of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-trained form has constantly hindered their opponents.
Rangers could dominate ownership but Livington did more with the ball they had.
They had to record only two minutes from the start when the first time's play-off of Menga sent Scott Pittman to a gooul of Allan McGregor but the Midfielder took his great chance.
Free-kick's strong Keaghan Jacobs then found the Craig Halket specter but his defence partner Alan Lithgow could only walk from behind.
Rangers achieved control but seemed there was more hope than believing about their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he had to have a penalty on the mark of fifteen minutes as he and Steven Lawless beat him but the referee Steven Thompson ignored the Colombian appeals.
Ringers successfully targeted only two shores in the first half of the item but the former goalkeeper of Ibrax Liam Kelly hardly worried about the blast of Lassana Cuulibally's head and the mild strike of Ovie Ejaria.
While the first gooul of Livi in 34 minutes could have been when the other team was playing better, no one can deny that they deserved only their effort.
Once again, Rangers were unable to manage a good set-face of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher pulled the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga to finish the action.
Gerard reacted in the brake by changing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change almost provided an immediate impact as the Winger pushed into Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halket who caught a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's side could extend their leading position in the final stages but McGregor held firmly to deny Jacobs before Lithgow went to open from the corner.
The successor of Ringers Glenn Middleton had another late request for penalty as he argued with Jacobs but again Thompson looked at the other side.
Almanak: Geiger Continuator innovator
And now a page from our Almanac of "Sunday Morning": 30 September, 1882, such as today 136 years old, and WE'RE EARING ... the day on which the future physics Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Continuator.
A science foundation since then, Geiger's Continuator has also become the foundation of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Beels of Coronado", in which those scientists' nightmares are seen unlikely Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "Is that some pastry she is?"
Rogers: "This Geiger Contractor, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.

A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cells with abnormal behaviour and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which is converted into a laboratory
They can then “see” a common protein for many cancers and then be injected again.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells by a patient, they change into the laboratory so that they can “see” a common protein for many cancers called HER2, and then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, U.S. National Cancer Institute at Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "stirring the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained the Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach to immune cell uptake by patients and how to "learn" how to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West made a Verbal attack Favor Trump, while he was wearing a Berryta of MAGA, After his appearance on SNL.
This Is Not Good
Kanye West was enrolled in the study during the Starday Night Live following a confusing performance in which U.S. President Donald Trump praised and said he was going to be elected in 2020.
After he sang his third song of the night, named Ghost Town in which he was wearing a blanket of Make Americana Great, he began to protest against the Democratics and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I talk to a white person and say to me, "How can you please Trump, what racist?"
If I had been concerned about racism, I had left America," he said.
SNL started the programme with a drop-out of the comedy in which Matt Damon appeared in which Hollywood's star rebutted the statement of Bret Kavanaugh to the Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although he did not broadcast, West video was posted on social media by mediar Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to make you laugh at West when she offered him.
In addition, West had complained with the audience that they had caught with him after the day about his holiday.
"Bold me behind the scenes.
He said, "Don't go out there with that blanket."
They bullied me!
Then they say they're lost," said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the lost? And he continued to say that he would've dressed the cap of my superior, because this means that you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments were triggered at least twice by the SNL audience and members of the case appeared embarrassed, reported Variety, with one person there who told the publication: "In all the students a big silence has fallen."
West brought it as a later substitute for the arena Ariana Grande, which the Boyfrend had, the Mac Miller rapper had died a few days ago.
West deeply touched many by the performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a bottle of Perier.
West had support from the president of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most courageous spirits: GRANTS OF THE FOLLA STAFF."
But the presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply "what it is and this is something beautiful intensities."
"But I didn't choose to reward anyone (by buying music or his clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe is embracing and spreading ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
So much so," she added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now it was "what was previously known as Kanye West."
It is not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The former rapper, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lyon and of course the legend of music that is no longer with us Prince, changed his name to a symbol then the artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted killing at knife points in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of having been murdered after being given a knife in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

The defendant is expected to appear before the Court of Justice of Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones Kit Harrington's star speaks of toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his role in making the sword as John Snow in the series of violent media fantasy of HBO Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor spoke about the stereotype of the hero macho, saying that such roles on the screen mean that the juviet often feels that they want to be violent to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and had doubts about how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old Geme of Thrones Rose Lesley, admitted to having "strong interests" to address the issue.
"Personally, I feel that I have a strong interest, right now--where did we go wrong with masculinity?" said he.
"What were we teaching men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we have now?"
It believed that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through its very male characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, which makes the juviet feel that they want to be this certain side of a man?
I think this is one of the great questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because it is very clear that something went wrong for the jurist."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make prequels or Sequels of Game of Thrones when the series arrived at the end of the following summer, saying that "so wars and horses".
Since November Kit will appear in the new production of True West of Sam Shepard which is the history of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that when he met his wife Rose it was the best thing he had ever come out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this programme, so he gave me my future family, and my life from here on," he said.
Rose interpreted the part of Ygrite, the interest of love of the character of Kit, John Snow, in the series of fantasy that won in Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in the land of Lesley's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% leap in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, say health officials.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people taking HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in the province of Yonan.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV from sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was declared in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is said to be common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most transmissions of diseases stem from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses that a staff member has disclosed GOP yearner data, says "dangerous lies" and "confulsion theories"
The U.S. representative Maxine Waters made allegations on Saturday that a member of its staff had posted the personal information of three U.S. Republicans on the pages of Wikipedia of legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles ensured that the claims were being disseminated by grandiaries and websites of the "right-wing ultra".
"False, lies and more lies of those who play," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information released allegedly included home addresses and telephone numbers of the United States Mayors Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hotch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against the nomination of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure took place some time after the three judges questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Fundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and released the information of a staff member of Waters, reported the Hill.
"This baseless allegation is completely false and absolutely false," continued Waters.
"My staff member – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – was in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unfounded allegation is entirely false and absolutely false."
The Waters statement quickly attracted online criticism, including from the former press secretary of White House Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is one of anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that it does not have the time to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
It shall not be resistant.
The defendant's motives shall not be called into question.
It shall be quiet and sound."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democracies, who was accused by the critics who appeared to be too angry at the Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will come out to take Waters' seat in the mid-term elections, also mentioned his voice on Twitter.
"This is a great thing if it's true," he said on Twitter.
In its statement, Waters stated that its office had warned the "appropriate law enforcement authorities and entities about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that authors will be discovered," continued, "and that they will be legally held accountable for all their actions which are harmful and dangerous for each and all members of my staff."
Johnny English Strakes Again — Rowan Atkinson, imitation of a powerless spy
It has now become traditional to look for Brexit's meanings in any new film with a British perspective and this seems applicable to the return of Johnny English-English's franchise of imitation of action - which started back in 2003 with Jonny English and came back alive in 2011 with Jonny English Reborn.
Is the iron self-satisfaction on the subject of how bad we are of course, the opportunity for a new export of the country?
At any rate, Johnny English competitors with large eyes and face-to-face movements unusually had a second-time renewed licence to do everything wrong - that his name is more than anything else shows that it is a widespread social creation designed for territories of people who go to cinemas that do not speak English.
Of course he is the silent secret agent who, despite his strange claims to his sweet past, has some of Clouseau, a hit by Mr. Bean and a large part of that man who contributed one note to the memorandum of the theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony in London.
It is also originally based on the international traveler and man of a mystery who once made his part of Barclaycard TV advertising, today forgotten, after leaving Coos behind.
There is a nice moment or two in the last issue of JE.
I liked the moment when Johnny English was approaching an helicopter while he was wearing a medieval corset dress and the blades of the propellers caught with his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's gift to the physical comedy appears, but humor feels rather poor and unusually excessive, especially as the film marks "series" such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves offer the comedy as an ingredient in a confident manner.
The humor is seen as being aimed at children rather than adults, and for me the strange unfortunate incidents of Johnny English were not as intuitive and as focused as Atkinson's silent film joke in Bean's personal.
The perennial topical offer now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has filtered the very secret web network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, to the disappointment of the working agent - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the cake on the cake for the prime minister who is an impressive figure and with difficulties, who is already suffering from a complete collapse of a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this character as Teresa May but is not much in the script to work.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy has been compromised, someone will have to be withdrawn.
And this means Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in an elegant building, but gives unofficial lessons on how to become an infiltrated operational: a few good joke here as English offers a School of Rock's Spicem.
English is taken back to Whitehall for emergency meetings and joins his former partner of great patience, Bogh, interpreted again by Ben Miller.
Bogh is now a married man, with a submarine commander, the role of one interpreted by Vicki Pepperdine, in which she is a little wasted.
Therefore, the two inseparable who have always disturbed everything in its Secret Service are back in action, when they meet with the character of a beautiful, quiet woman, Ophelia Bulteova, interpreted by Olga Curylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the rule of the billionth of sweet technology which claims that he can solve British computer problems: Mayor Jason Volta, interpreted by Jacke Lacy.
English and Bogh start their journey of fun behavior on a farm: dress as wetters, light up a high French restaurant, create a caus to climb on Volta's luxury yacht; and English starts a full arch as it tries to use virtual reality offices to familiarize itself with Volta's home entrance.
Certainly all stops lead to that last sequence, but as amicable and as authentic as it is, has little idea of children's television.
Something's rather moderate.
And like the other films of Johnny English I couldn't think: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that he really deserves for his talent?
The Labour refuses to prepare a plan for the British to work a week of four days but is paid for five days
The Jeremmy Corbyn Labor Party is expected to consider a radical plan that will see the British work a week of four days – but paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the teacher of the companies to pass on the remainder of the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) to the workers by giving them another day of savings.
This would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still take the same pay with them.
Sources said that the idea would be "deprived" with the agenda and economic plans of the party that the country is turning in favour of workers.
The shift to a week of four days has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way to take advantage of the changing economy.
Senior official of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "I expect a policy review to be announced before the end of the year.
"This will not happen for tomorrow but a four-day working week is an inspiration that deserves the party's approach to rebalancing the pro-worker economy as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party shall not be the first to approve such an idea, with the Green Party promising a working week of four days during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, the aspiration is currently not approved by the Labor Party as a whole.
Speaker for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
The Archbishop of Opposition John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to take back power from "anonymous directors" and "advanced users" in utility firms.
The opposition canister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take back their entire share as soon as a Labour government can make a "deduction" based on perceived misconduct.
It also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create Inclusive Strong Funds to give 10 per cent of the equity of private sector firms to employees, who are willing to take annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy says to "60 Minutes" if the Kavanaugh FBI investigation can change their mind
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Bert Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by one week, and raised the question whether the findings of the bureau could influence a Republican mayor to withdraw his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Republican Governors John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Hail, and surely," said Kennedy.
"I said when I entered the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after he issued that allegation, and said, "Did I do it?"
He was resolved, determined, inequable."
However, Graham's vote seems difficult to change.
"I've already decided about Bert Kavanaugh and must be a very big accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bret denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And any person mentioned cannot verify it.
It is 36 years old.
I haven't seen anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Did Something to Reduce Poverty?
Next Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a very impressive list of stars that will appear and another equally impressive mission; ending the world's poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people free to the Great Law of Central Park not only enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and China Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Power Project, a representative group with the hope of ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless I was willing to pay a VIP ticket), those who were going to the concert had to end a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, send an e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call or other significant ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the remaining 12-year Global Citizen achieved its objective?
The idea of rewarding people free of charge is a genuine way to persuade people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clictivism" - people feel that they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says that it has registered more than 19 million "actions" than those who put it, which I stand for a number of different objectives.
It states that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies that are equivalent to more than $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announced its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that so far safe funds have made a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "help children grow to their full potential", promising Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 hits from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a bottom-up note in history," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Traction Ulman to the crowd during a direct concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to invite the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequent questions on his website that asks "what makes you think that we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the large movements of civil rights and against the apartheid, we will succeed, because we have more power when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Here Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the artists who will appear at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Le Florence and Hugh Jackman.
US uses Naval Fleet for "blocking" to hinder Russian energy exports - Internal Secretariat
"If necessary", Washington may resort to its Naval Fleet to prevent Russian energy from affecting markets, including the Middle East, has revealed the United States Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia’s enlargement in Syria – especially, where it is operating with a legitimate government invitation – is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of addressing this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Naval Fleet, to ensure that sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy has not reached the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing those who attended the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that called itself the "energy consumer voice" in the US.
It continued to compare Washington approaches in addressing Russia and Iran, noting that these are effectively the same.
"The economic choice on Iran and Russia is, slightly or too, fuel leverage and substitution," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-stop shop" with an economy dependent on carbon fuels.
The claims come from the fact that Trump's administration was on a mission to strengthen its liquefyed natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of Trump's administration, including the President of the United States Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to exit from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas project, which according to Trump, made Berlin the "lever" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gased of $11 billion, which is expected to double the existing gas capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's intense opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of Germany for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), invited the United States to stay away from Europe's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Sir "Examine Whether" If You go out for a president in 2020, Say the Mayor of Massachusetts
The Mayor of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren, Saturday said that he would "examine correctly" whether he would come out for a president after the mid-term elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that it considers it coming out.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government and this includes a woman in the highest position," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will examine whether I will go out for a president."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the council meeting, saying that he was "take this country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was direct in her criticism of Trump and his nomination to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey issued on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own constituents do not think that they should be elected in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of the "probable" voters of Massachusetts said that the hairdresser should not be elected, according to the survey of the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the election issue.
The survey showed further support for the election by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent who supported and 48 per cent against a potential election.
Other high profile democratic names that have been discussed in relation to a potential issue for the 2020 election include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Governor of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said to decide officially by January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin refers to Track Palin PTSD in the display of Donald Trump
Track Palin, aged 26, spent one year in Iraq after being registered in September
He was arrested and brought before an incident of domestic violence on Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after his return, I can relate to other families who feel the fines of the PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers will return with," she told the audience in a demonstration for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the obvious problem that no one is addressing" and said about her son and other war Showers, "they return a little different, return stronger, hesitate to think whether there is that respect for what other soldiers like them and air personnel, and any other members of the military, gave to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wesilla, Alaska, and was put on a domestic violence attack against a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of arms while he was drunk, according to this Bennet, speaking to the Wassila Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports a challenge for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District are supporting a legal challenge to a new US policy to deny asylum to victims fleeing from gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts, Friday presented a case of a court friend in Washington to support an asylum-seekers challenging the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the actor in the case of Grace versus Sexs that the American Civil Liberties Union submitted in August against the federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and the boys members of his violent gang," abused her but the U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
It was held in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, producing a large number of asylum applicants in the US, as nations are facing invasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy returned a 2014 decision from the Board of Appeal of Migrants which allowed undocumented immigrants to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Friday, in a statement, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia Carl Racine said that the new policy "neglects decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires all asylum claims to be judged on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a reason violates this principle, said a friend of the court.
The lawyers continued to argue in the event that the policy to deny immigrants income harms the US economy, claiming that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
Advocate General Jeff Genders ordered immigration judges to cease granting asylum to victims who fled from domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Absolute asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in its political announcement on 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all problems -- even all serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Deprived rescue efforts in Pallu as the number of deaths doubles in the fight against time to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become increasingly alarming.
"It feels very intense," said a 35-year-old mother, who was embracing her son a child with fever in an evacuation centre in Palu's miserable city.
"Every minute ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
The residents appeared to return to their destroyed homes, looking in their stuff flooded with water, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 size, were overfilled.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Harris, which suffered a fallout in his face and shoulder, remained outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to ongoing healthy shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he related that he felt the violent earthquake moving the hotel floor into the fifth floor he was using with his wife and daughter.
"There was no chance of saving ourselves.
I was crushed with the remains of the wall, I think," Harris said to Associated Press, adding that his family was in the place for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda adverts"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper, an ad on four pages was issued in a US daily newspaper which attempts to sell the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador for China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the newspaper most widely sold in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the US congress elections on 6 November, accusing China of rejecting it.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections marked what US officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in a campaign from Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to make adverts to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently attached to an ongoing trade war which has seen them passing tariffs on imports of each of them.
The Chinese retaliation fees at the beginning of the commercial war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa which supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Brand, US ambassador for China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods for China, said that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad on an opinion page in the Sunday's De Moines Register, "now doubling this pooling by making propaganda adverts in our own free press."
"In the dissemination of its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's beloved tradition of free expression and free press by placing a paid advert in the Des Moines Register," wrote Brandtad.
"In contrast, on the press stand down the road here in Beijing, you will find voices of limited dissemination and you will not see a true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China's problematic economic theory, as the media is under restriction of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoids the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Are Obsolete Women Voting Before the Middle-term Elections with the Kavanah Debate, Alert Analysts
As many Republicans of the top are supporting and defending the nomination of the Supreme Court Bret Kavanaugh when facing various allegations of sexual attack, analysts warned that they will see an adverse reaction, particularly during the forthcoming mid-term elections.
Feelings about this were very high, and most Republicans are already officially showing that they wanted to lead by vote.
These things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last minute push of Governor Jeff Flick (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national speakers for the progressive MoveOn group Friday, according to the Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators sang " November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate Hall as the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to run with the designation of Kavanauh despite the statement by Dr Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high, said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partial political analyst to the news site.
"People are saying they were already high; and true.
"But they may be higher, particularly between women voters who turn the vote into under-votings and younger voters, 18 to 29 years of age, who do not like the president, often do not vote."
As a member of the so-called ‘Prime Council’ of the so-called ‘Lugansk People's Republic’ of the so-called ‘Lugansk People's Republic’ of the so-called ‘Lugansk People's Republic’ of the so-called ‘Lugansk People's Republic’ of the so-called ‘Lugansk People's Republic’ of the People's Republic of China.
"This has become a complete disturbance for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"This does not only concern the committee's vote or the final vote on whether Kavanaugh is placed on the bank, it also concerns the way the Republicans handled this situation and how they handled it," indicated the news station Guy Cecil, director of the USA PRIORITIES, a group that helps to elect the Democracies.
However, Americans appear to be in some way divided over believers in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with little more support for the latter.
A new survey by YuGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents believed definitively or probably the Ford's statement, while 35 per cent said that they believed definitively or probably the Ford's statement.
In addition, 38 per cent said that they thought that Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during his statement, while 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
Following the push by Flick, the FBI is currently investigating allegations submitted by Ford as well as at least another accused, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanauh while he was a drunkard attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court’s nomination exposed his genital to her while they were in a holiday while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Investor plans to Start a New Internet to compete against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the explorer of the World Wide Web, will launch a new business that seeks to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The Commission considers that the measure constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee noted that the intention behind Inrupt is "the domain of the world."
"We want to do it now," he said about the new business.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal online data store" or POS.
It may contain contact lists, lists of what to do, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spofify were all available on one browser and all at the same time.
What makes the single personal online data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls this "personal autonomy by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce's CEO, is that the company brings adequate resources, process skills and skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform brought by IBM, some staff developers who have a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
By starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications through the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Le said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they should introduce a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down from today to tomorrow.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a place on the medium published on Saturday, Berners-Le wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Le transformed the Internet when establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Le will remain the Founder and the Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I find an enormous optimist for this next era of web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Clerical celebration of World War I's Cross Victoria
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won Victoria Cross during World War I as a rival was celebrated in his village 100 years later.
Lord The Reverend Bernard Van won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack in Belenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a four-day sniper and never knew that he had won the highest British military honour.
Saturday a commemorative stone was discovered by his two grandsons in a row in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that he was "symbolically symbolic" that the stone had to be discovered exactly 100 years after the victory of his grandfather's prize.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, the Lt Kor led his battle across the Channel de Saint-Quentin "in many fog and fire from rifles on the ground and machinery Guns."
Later he rushed to the line of fire and "the greatest courage" led the line forward before he went to a rifle on the spot alone and lost consciousness three of the band.
The Col Lt was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just one month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72 years old, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never get there but something very humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Van also put a girland behind the bulkhead, which was led by the Brentwood imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that he was "very honored to have played a role in this parable" and added "the courage of a genuine hero was demonstrated by the support to be given by many people."
OMA supporters remained awake all night to see Bellator 206, instead of ending up with Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you've been awake all night to see Bellator 206 packed to end up denied seeing the main event.
The list by San José included 13 fights, including six on the main card and were shown direct overnight in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
In 6am, as Gerard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the United Kingdom remained confused when the broadcast was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they had been raised to early hours especially for the fight.
One Party on Twitter described the change to the child's carton as "some kind of giant joke."
"It is a government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was not appropriate therefore had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Bellator's marketing and communication, when asked about transmission.
"Peppa the pig," yes."
The president of the company Belator Scott Coker said that they would work on their scheduling to include viewers from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, we probably can fix something," said Coker.
"But at present there are the six o'clock on Sunday morning and we will not be able to arrange until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we are working on it.
Emmy, when the broadcast was switched, there were many messages going on and not all were sweet.
We were trying to fix the solution, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was not, it was a governmental issue.
I can promise you that the next time it happens.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we normally do - and we have tried to deliver it more to the supporters and instead to an excess.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" because of sexuality
The Olympic Mass Tom Daley says that it has grown to feel inferior to everyone because of his sex - but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said that he had not realized until he went to the secondary that "not everyone like me."
Speaking of the first Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Loverne, he said he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that as a parent he became less concerned with winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-standing programme, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of illness.
While appearing as a person set aside on the first programme of Laverne, Dally said that he felt "less than" others as he grew up because "societally unacceptable to you are boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those emotions that you feel less than, and feel different, were the real things that gave me the power and strength that I can succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something", said, not to disappoint everyone when they eventually became aware of his sexuality.
The Olympic Bronze Medal has twice become a high profile promoter for LGBT and has used its appearance in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt fortune that he could live freely without rags and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world winner for three times said that when he became a man-friendly film producer from the United States Dustin Lance Black, he met in 2013 - "was surprised" for him.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he, last year but said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When he went through so many things of such a young age - he went to his first Olympics of 14 years and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar beautiful and painful experiences.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Dally, and Dally said that his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, the important thing for me was to 'I want to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are things larger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dally said that his father did not accept that he would die and one of the things he had asked was whether they already had tickets for London 2012 - since he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't say to him, 'You won't be here to be in the front row, pà'," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally recognized that it was not incontrovertible," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life -- to bow before a crowd from countries in the Olympic Games, there was no better sensation," he said.
It also inspires the first choice of his song – a Heather Small Proud – which was compatible with it in the Olympic walk and still has a chill.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mikkelson who is no longer in shape remains on the bank in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mikkelson will make a record on Saturday when he plays his 47 game of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to change his shape to avoid being an important stage not so happy.
Mikkelson, who plays in the biennial event for a record of 12 times, stayed on the bank by master Jim Furyk for Saturday’s footballs and figures.
Instead of being the centre of action, as it was often for the US, the great winner of five times shared his day between supporting and working on his game from a distance hoping to correct his concerns.
One who would never have given the ball even in the middle of his career, the 48-year-old man is not ideal for the difficult course of Le Golf National, where long distance once again corrects wrong shutters.
And if the course alone is not of sufficient heartlessness, Mikkelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, is faced with the exact champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, which joined Tommy Flietwood, a new one for the season, to win all four games this week.
If Americans, with four points less than the start of the 12 single games, start well, the Mikkelson game can prove to be a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, pointed me on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"There's a lot of confidence in himself.
He Hall of Famer and contributed greatly to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably did not see him playing two parties.
I've seen more, but this is the way it worked and this is the way we thought it would go.
He must be out there, like everyone else."
Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's record for the most-favoured Rider Cup items played on Sunday.
This can mark the end of a Rider Cup career that has not quite reached the mills of its individual record.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven-halfs, although Furyk said his presence brought a few intangibles for the team.
"He takes you in, discharges, funny, loves to laugh with people, and a very good man to have in the team room," explained.
"I think the younger players were happy to criticize him, this week, which was fun to see.
He provides much more than just games."
European master Thomas Bjorn that the great lead position can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European master, knows from experience that a position in front of the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily be changed into a comfortable journey.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Balesteros maintained a five-point advantage over Americans but ended up with a slide with a real narrow margin, with a victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"Keep reminding yourself that we had a great front position in Valderrama; we had a great front position in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a little," said Bjorn, in the press, after seeing the 2018 class winning 5-3 both Friday and yesterday to be on board by 10-6 in the Golf National Le.
So the history will show me and everyone in this team that hasn't finished everything yet.
Tomorrow you go with your own body.
Get out there and do all the good things.
It has not ended until you have brought points on the team.
We have an objective, and what we try to hide this tip, and the focus remains there.
I've always said, focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well what the other side – the world's largest players."
Content as his players played on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "Never go step away from me in this.
A different challenge is still ahead.
It still concerns the individual performances we see, and this is a different thing to do.
It's very nice to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when there's out individually, then it's tested for your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message that you want to pass on to the players, which comes out your best tomorrow.
Now, leave the partner behind and he wants to leave and get out his best, too."
In contrast to Bjorn, the opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to play better individually than when they did as partners, with exceptions which they Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas, who acquired three points from four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those last days that could change everything, after he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before a hero ended as Europe made the "Medinah Miracles."
"I remember at least a word from her," said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the master in 1999, prepared his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important items, but you want to bring him to that start as soon as I saw him in Brookline, as I saw in Mediah.
When that momentum comes one side, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle parties.
We have drawn up our list as appropriate and put those men in the way we felt, you know, we are trying to do a few miracles tomorrow."
Thomas had been given the task of trying to lead the fight back and facing Roy McLroy in the best game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fliewood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the best half of order.
"I went with this group of men in this way because I think it covers all the way," said Bjorn about his choices of singles.
Germany's new war postponed again
The newest German Naval Fleet frame had to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the older Bierda Wartime Frangates, but there will not be at least until next year due to systems with growing defects and cost, reported by local media.
The commission of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new firefighters of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a speaker for the military.
The vessel had to join the Naval Fleet in 2014, but the post-delivery problem presented the outcome of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels that ordered the Naval Fleet back in 2007 will be a substitute for the older Bremen class framers.
It is understood that they will have strong cannons, an exhibition of missiles against aircraft and against ships as well as some cateal technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signs.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods – this should be possible to operate the newest framens up to two years away from home ports.
However, a continuous delay means that the ships of the last technology - mentioned to allow Germany to project overseas power - will already be old enough when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 fork of bad luck appeared in the news last year, when the German Naval Fleet officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Naval Fleet returned a ship to shipbuilders after it was delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for this, but German media quoted a number of "software and hardware defects" crucial that made the ship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers - only half of the workers on the older Bremen class frames.
In addition, it appeared that the vessel is well overburdened to reduce its performance and limit the capacity of the Naval Fleet to increase future updates.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tonnes is understood to be twice as heavy than similar class vessels used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – is also becoming a problem.
This is said to have reached an alarming amount of €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) – from an initial €2.2 billion.
The problems of the newest framers become especially important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Naval Fleet currently "has a shortage of ships to withstand deployment."
The official said that the problem had grown over time, as old ships had been commissioned but replacement vessels had not been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuertemberg class framers could join the Naval Fleet.
National Trust is mentioned on the secret life of bats at night
New ground research in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape when looking for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of single flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists in the National Trust for Scotland will follow common pipistreles and a suprano as well as long-eared brown nightbirds and Daubenton in the Inverwee Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key premises around the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert analysis of the sound of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of bat calls at night and what species are doing.
A habitat map and a report will then be produced which will create a detailed picture of the scale of their behavioural landscape.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grazing and how best to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and across the UK has decreased considerably over the last century.
They are under threat from building and development work affecting the buildings and habitat losses.
Wind and light turbines can also pose a risk, as can poison cards to catch insects and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are not currently blind.
However, due to the traditions of their nottourna hunting their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated eco-locality techniques to indicate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously at night.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, house inspections and sometimes rescue.
The organisation has even established the first and only reserve of Scotland bats at Terrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which hosts eight of the ten species of Scotland's nightly bats.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Terave we have a very good area for bats tonight," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is much more about bats that are not yet known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about what they need to flourish."
It stresses the importance of checking bats for the maintenance of properties as it is possible that unintended destruction of a single maternity nest could kill up to 400 women and young people, possibly destroying a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, mock them or sadden them or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrel, a Scottish company officer for the Trust for the Conservation of Nightfowl, encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We have much to learn about our bats tonight and for most of our species we still don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape as lawyers are willing to seek a German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo pointed to rape claims against him as "false news," saying that people "must promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are expected to seek with the court the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The player of Portugal and Juventus who plays ahead was accused of raping an American woman, Catherine Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He alleged that he had paid $375,000 at the time to not say anything about the accident, reported Dr Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking of a video on Instagram Live with 142 million of its followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, noted the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the winner of Ballon d'Or five times looking at the camera.
"We must promote ourselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They must be famous to say my name, but this is part of the work.
I'm a happy man and everything's going well," the player added, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to seek out Dr Spiegel by court on allegations, which they called "uneligible reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz said that the player seeks compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the breach, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident was reported to have taken place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a discoteca, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly supplanted it from the anus, according to documents submitted at the District Court of Clark County in Nevada.
Mayorga argues that Ronaldo fell on his knee after the alleged incident and told her that it was "99 per cent" "well-man" disappointed by the "one per cent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that both were sexually related, but that this was by consensus.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to a solution outside the court because she felt "shown by retaliation" and was concerned to "be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman says that she is now seeking to switch to the solution as soon as she is traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo had arrived to join Real Madrid by Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he joined the Italian football legends Juventus in an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: UK "discharges forever" lost car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "distributes it forever" if it loses its position as world leader in the manufacture of cars after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was of "disquieting concern" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of delays at the borders in the case of Brexit of no agreements is worth jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Auris and Avensis of Toyota - produced almost 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, top management director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW states, for example, that it will close its Mini plant for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the case of Brexit of no agreement.
Toyota's production line works today on a "right on time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for cars in order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a border disruption that industry says could lead to delays and failures of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to maintain an inventory of more than one day at its Derbyshire plant, the company claimed, and therefore production would be discontinued.
Mr Clark says that Theressa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "accurately calibrated to avoid these border controls."
"We need agreement. We want to have the best agreement that allows, as I say, not only the success of enjoying it at present but for us to seize this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue what was a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say for how long production was stopped, but in a longer period, it warned that increased costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the defendant of the Unite Union at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience when these jobs leave, never return.
Speaker for government said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosentein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's risky meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosentein could be "delayed by another week" as the fight on the nomination of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continued, said White House on Sunday.
Rosentein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's and Russia's aid and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will exclude the Deputy Attorney General, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, Washington's successful instigation for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosentein discussed wired clothing to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by 25 amendments.
Rosentin rejected the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, although there were reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, which was then the United Nations in New York, scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said that he "prefers not" to expel Rosentein but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid confusion with the hearing of the Senate judicial committee containing Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom gave their testimony.
On Friday, Trump gave an order to the FBI to conduct an investigation of claims against Kavanaugh over a period of one week, which delayed further full voting of the Senate.
On Sunday, the press secretary of Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When asked about the Rosentein meeting, she said: "It has not yet been set a date for this, it may be this week, and it may be the following week because of all the other things going on with the supreme court.
But now I see and I always love keeping the picture up-to-date."
Some journalists challenge this assertion: Sanders has not organised a press meeting in White House since 10 September.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of meetings was not due to a lack of grace with TV journalists "who try to attract and influence the audience", although she said: "Although I agree with the fact that they try to attract and influence the audience."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the picture would increase.
"The president conducts more questions and answers sessions compared to any agreed president," she added without quoting any evidence: "Look at those numbers."
The meetings will still be held, said Sanders, but "if the picture has the chance to ask questions directly to the US president, this is far better than talking to me.
We try to do this a lot and have seen us do it many times in the last few weeks and this will replace the press meeting where one can talk to the US president."
Trump rarely answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting churches.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he behaves gently and sometimes strangely in front of groups of journalists.
The health secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about the Brexit-related fears
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the gratitude and desire of the country that they remain there after Brexit.
Jane Freeman MSP sent a letter when less than six months remained for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to the cost of defined status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue continued, moving towards decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK Government was also increasing its preparations for a possible scenario of no agreement.
I know this is certainly an unstable time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to support now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, irrespective of their nationality.
Fellows from across the EU, and beyond, bring with them valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and are beneficial to the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely home and I wish you very much to stay here."
Chrision Abercrombe Making Emergency Surgeon After suffered a Rassus injury
The Tennesse State Niger Networkbacker Christion Abercrombe conducted emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury on Saturday when his team lost against the Vanderbilt Commodores by 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The main state coach of Tennesse Road Red told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the halftime.
"He went on the sideline and fell there," said Reed.
The coach and medical staff gave Abercrombe oxygen on the sideline before placing it on a tractor and took it back for further examination.
State Officer of Tennesse told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was no longer operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris adds that "so far there is no detail about the type/extreme of the injury" and the Tennessee State is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombe, a student in the second year of the university suspended, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after he left Ilinois.
The Saturday in all he had five tokens before leaving the game, which led to a total of 18 tokens of his season.
Foreign buyers will be required to pay more on stamp tax when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be required to pay more on ball tax when buying properties in the UK with extra money used to help homeless people under new Tory plans
This change will neutralise Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in stamp tax will be charged to non-taxpayers in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects it to rise to £120 million per year - to help homeless people
Today Teresa May will announce that foreign buyers should pay a higher rate of ball tax when buying property in the UK - with extra money used to help homeless people.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and target those who earn a high wage.
The increase in stamp tax will be imposed on non-taxable individuals and firms in the UK, with extra money boosting the Government's efforts to fight road sleep.
The additional payment - which is additional to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second housing and rental-purpose purchases - may be three percent.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to £120 million per year.
Some 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by non-United Kingdom residents, which are increasing prices and thus making it more difficult for new buyers to take the first step in the purchase of accommodation.
Many rich areas of the country – particularly in the capital city – have become "famous cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending much of their time abroad.
The new policy was issued just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in ball tax so that more young people are helped to buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms that were keeping property prices high by kidnapping and not using the land, and urged Ms. May to abandon allowances on affordable housing in order to remedy the "housing of housing" situation in the UK.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and the end of dismissals "without any fault".
He also wants to give the councils great powers to build new houses.
Ms May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my post to restoring the UK's dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And this means fixing our damaged housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, find it easy to buy homes as well as UK biscad residents.
For many people the dream of having a home has become too far, and the indivisibility of sleeping in the streets remains very real."
Jack Rice: "My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland"
The head of Sunderland Jack Rose says that his "fundamental ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scottish welcomes the challenge of revitalising the North-East club, which is currently in third place in League One, with three points different from that in the first place.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after guiding St. Mirren back to the Scotch Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to play for countries as a player.
I got B cap and nothing more," Rose told Sportstone of Scotland's BBC.
"But when I was still a child, I often went with my father to see Scotland playing in Hampden, and it always remains the thing that drew me back.
However, this opportunity only comes if I manage a club."
Previous Rox managers include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says that he was not concerned about the fact that he would follow such established names in such a large club, while he had previously refused the offer from the City of Bernsley and Ipswich.
"At present, success for me will be based on "I can deliver this club again to the President League?"
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that this club belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I probably think I've only succeeded here if I can take the club back there."
He was also responsible for the management of the company's activities and was responsible for the management of the company's activities.
He then helped Alloa recover from the regexin for the third category, and turned St Mirren from the edge of the regexin to winners of the title of the Campionate the following season.
And Ross says that he is now feeling more comfortable than he felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
As regards when Alloa took over, he recalled that "it was probably a big change."
"Perhaps I thought that the position of manager was the most suitable one for me, much more than that of a player.
This may sound strange by going well, having a decent living, and enjoying some reasonable achievements.
But the games can be difficult.
There are many things you have to go through every week.
I still experience this in terms of stress and work pressure but I just feel that the post of manager is right for me.
I always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I feel that throughout my adult life I am now feeling the most comfortable."

Survey finds that the best time to take a beer pin is at 5.30pm in the evening
The summer heat wave boostd the earnings of UK public in difficulty but increased pressure on the restaurants of the same company.
In July, groups of people and bars saw a 2.7 per cent increase in sales – but figures revealed that the return on restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business advisory CGA, who collected the figures, said: "Incessant sun and the longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern for the previous month of June, when sales in the public increased by 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were even more affected.
The reduction of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trade in June continued to worsen in July.
The public and bars whose main sales are the beverages were the ones most well-run in terms of the financial results compared to the previous period while the sales of restaurants decreased.
Publics whose main sales are food also suffered in heat, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
People seem to just want to get out of drinking.
The sales of beverages in the bars and bars have increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the food has dropped to three per cent."
Paul Newman, one of RSM's analysts regarding entertainment and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sports events remain the main factors in terms of the market sales of take-aways.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent a year later will be particularly burdensome in addition to continuing cost pressures.
The warm and long summer could not come at a worse time for operators whose main sales are food and only time can advise us whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the needed rest."
The growth of total sales in public and restaurants, including the opening of new businesses, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow pace in launching new businesses.
The monitoring of the sales of the Coffer Peach Tracker industry for the UK public sector, bars and restaurants collects and analyses the performance data from 47 operational groups, with combined revenues of more than £9 billion, and is the industry's established benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts hiding from their parents
Survey reveals that one in five children - some of them at 11 - have secret social media accounts hidden from their parents and teachers
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the pages "Insta Falls"
The news has great fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they have a "key" account to show their parents
One in five children – some of whom are 11 years old – are creating social media accounts that are hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in the "Insta sheets" accounts - a reference to the site for the sharing of Instagram's photos.
The news has great fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operated a present "key" account to show their parents, while having other private ones.
A mother who met her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a young woman who was encouraging others to rape her - "stuppy me."
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistries Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of young people aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, half of them admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that many young people are attracted to creating online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eliidh Doyle will become the "Voice for athletes" on the Scottish athletic board
Eliidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish athletic board as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most athlete of the course and not of the course which has largely won medals and President Ian Beattie described this change as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from its vast experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletic community and we are sure that the athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly by becoming part of the board," said Beatie.
Doyle said: "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and I hope that I can really contribute and help lead sport in Scotland."
The American, which has won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta amongst its total of four Olympic Games gold medals and is now a regular BBC criticism, has ceased to function after it has suffered from a small stroke.
On Twitter he wrote: "As today you give me a month of stroke.
I couldn’t walk.
Doctors have said that only time can give us advice if I do not recover or to what extent.
It was hard work but I was completely recovered, I learned how to breathe again and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump resonance comparing mothers to cows gives rise to different opinions online
A breast pump company has given rise to different opinions online by advertising comparing breast-feeding mothers to breeding cows.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered to be "the first non-nosy world breast pump", the consumer's technological company Elvie issued an aired advert from an iron music video to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives mothers using the breast pump.
Four real mothers dance in a drum full of cow's straw with a disc that includes such lyrics as: "Yes, I'm milking myself but I don't have a tail" and "In case I don't think they're a pig, but a chest."
The corus continues: "Pump out, pump out, I'm feeding my babies, pump out, pump out, I'm milking my women."
However, the advertising published on the company Facebook page caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, the video received different reactions from viewers, many of which say it sheds light on the "terrors" of the milk industry.
Someone wrote "It was a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken to them within a few days of giving birth".

Someone else commented: "One understands that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "Really cut off from reality."
Others defended the ads, with a believing woman who found the disc "very fun."
"I think this is a generic idea.
If I were still nursing, I would have bought one.
Posting would make me feel the same as a cow.
The advert is a little or too mad but I've taken it as it is.
This is a genetic product," wrote someone.
Someone else commented: "This is a fun advert for mothers who pump (often on their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like "cows".
This is not an advert that praises or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they were all dancing with the pumps they did not give to the eye placed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their chests say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump, does not make any noise, has no wire or tube and sits in a breast-feeding bar without giving it in the eye, thus giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even come out while they are pumping.
Anna Ballarin, a partner and ECD in Mother commented: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a bold and catalytic launch.
By comparing the women using the breast pump with the dairy cows we wanted to focus on pumping the breast and all the challenges it brings, while showing in a fun way and in a way that can be related to it, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time that Elvie pump appeared on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the catalogue for the designer Marta Jacobowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Moving Without Words to the Texas Border Camp
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply despite the fact that the monthly border crossing has not changed much, in part because of the fact that rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult for children to be placed with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and they were afraid that if they presented themselves to care for a child they would endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their breasts would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, witnessed to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Almost 80 per cent of the individuals who are either sponsors or home members of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and most of them are foreign criminals.
That is why we continue to look for these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to speed up the process involving children, officials have introduced new rules which will require some of them to appear in court within one month of their detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, depending on the shilling workers.
Many will appear via a video conference, instead of personally, to bring arguments in favour of their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those considered ineligible for aid will be immediately transferred.
According to the blacksmith workers and the reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the more children are held under custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or distressed, which may lead to their violent expression or attempt to escape.
The lawyers said that these concerns would increase in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where it is more likely to ignore signs that a child is finding difficult, due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the town of tents without giving enough time to prepare them emotionally or without telling their partners how much strength they have can lead to trauma that many of them are already struggling.
Syria tells the "occupied forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
While addressing the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as a former deputy minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory, justifying the fight against terrorism, and "will be properly addressed."
"They shall withdraw immediately and without any condition," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011 more than 360,000 people have died, with millions more displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue "to fight this sacred battle until we are expelled from all Syrian territories" both the terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, many of which train and advise both the Kurdian forces and the Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the country destroyed by the war.
As regards the refugee issue, Moualem said that the conditions were good for them to return, and he imposed "in some Western countries" for "screaming rational fears" that led the refugees to keep away.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicalizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last strong major rebel of Idlib created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale attack by Syrian forces supported by the Russians on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target the Jeddahns including Al-Qaida-related Nursra fighters, which would "be destroyed".
UN sender Staffan de Mistura is hoping to soon convene the first new committee meetings composed of members of government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be restricted "to review the articles of the current constitution", warning against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Mandate
With this in mind, in 2020 Mr Trump will win the re-election provided that, as many free viewers are hoped, the denunciation and scandal end his presidency ahead of time.
What is undoubtedly "The most dramatic final that was ever in a chair!"
So far, it appears that viewers have not yet painted.
Since 2014, time ratings with the largest number of viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and have almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in time with the largest number of viewers, more than 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Madow Show" increased cable television ratings by even 3.5 million viewers on the nights of the main news.
"This is a situation that attracts people to it because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, presenter of the ABC program drama "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, writer of the Veteran Academys and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Trusts About Being Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
she asked.
"He said, "Why take me," she said to me Mrs. Skovl.
In this case there is a value of entertainment.
Contrary to anything else on TV, stories coming from Washington can undoubtedly determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrants' families can reunite and the strength of the global economy.
To ignore what is happening around you is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself following a panel of experts to discuss the use by Bob Woodward of "deep background" sources for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's "Fear", "Womber-skined coat" ("Washington Post", said Paul Manafort's "Washington Post" with a value of $15,000 and the implications of the descriptions of Mr Trump's anatomy from Stormy Daniel.
I, for example, will never again look at Super Mario in the same way.
"A part of what he's doing as if it's a real show is that every night he's leading you something," said Brent Montgomery, Chief Executive of Welhouse Intertinent and the creator of "Pawn Stars", on the changing case and the development in the daily plot of the Trump programme (combar with N.F.L., commend Kim Jong-un).
You cannot afford to lose one event because it falls back.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, outside of his home the weather was sun with 80 degrees in the North coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC recording CNN.
He could not have emerged from the front of television, not when Bert Kavanaugh was ready to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
"I remember when we previously did those exciting programmes and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr Fleiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but actually they were right."

Large amounts of money coming from abroad to the toughest races in the mid-term election of the White House
It is not surprising that the 17 country districts of Pennsylvania are seeing a large amount of money, thanks to the realignment of congnitional districts which acquired two operators in a race for the same seat.
It recently re-established the Pittsburg suburban pits – Democratic Representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is issuing as a candidate against another operator, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the 12 old Pennsylvania districts, which extend considerably over the 17 new districts.
The maps were re-established after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts were pre-constituted in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the 17 new districts triggered a difficult competition of the financial campaign between the main party's weapons of finance, the Democratic Campaign Conference Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after winning with a little difference in the March special election followed largely by the 18th Congregation District of Pennsylvania.
That chair belonged to a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
The political critics have given the Democracies a small advantage.
The United States considered penalising El Salvador for supporting China, and then decided not to do so.
The diplomas noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little aid from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump held a reception meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama and held a hotel in Panama until some partners expelled the Management Team of the Trump Organisation.
Officials of the State Department decided to contact the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama again on the "recent decisions to cease to recognise Taiwan," said the speakers of the Heather Nauret department, in a statement at the beginning of this month.
However, the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received around $140 million in US aid in 2017, including narcotics controls, development and economic support in 2017.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been burdensome for the Central American country and its high unemployment and killing rates.
As the internal meetings began to progress, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, the officials of the highest administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with a view to effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence was strongly criticized to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance of the administration being placed on the meeting, said the diplomas.
And the three American senders returned calmly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new and hard message or punishment from Washington.
Speaker of the White House, Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were supported by a foreign analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke of the condition of anonymity.
History Study
The next unexpected negative event could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible disruption of justice by Mr Trump, for which there is now very substantial evidence in the public register.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was agreed with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In the event that the Congress passes on to another person, Mr Trump will find himself responsible in that body, as he prepares to go back to the voters, and possibly eventually a jury of his peers.
This involves a lot of uncertainties, and I do not aim to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – nor that of his equivalent in Europe.
There are options to be made by all of them on both sides of the Atlantic which will affect how long the fight will be prolonged.
In 1938, German officials were willing to carry out a cup d'État against Hitler, if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such inflation points, and the inexhaustible march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Today Americans face many of these inflection points.
What will we do if Mr Trump goes after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosentein, the man who controls the fate of Mr Mueller's investigation?
Rosentin has been in trouble since this document reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be recorded in a secret and speculative manner that is not suitable for office.
Mr Rosentein said the report of The Times was inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the F.B.I. investigation of a new request of Bret Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual conduct and dishonest evidence?
And above all, in the middle of the terms will we vote for a Congress that will hold Mr Trump responsible?
If we do not pass these tests, there will be a shift in democracy.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied the home of my ambassadors.
She managed to live, migrate to America and, 60 years later, on the day of worshiping God sent me to light the candles on that table with swastika.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorans of the Rangers is an optimist before the competitive game with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with the recognition that the victory against Austrians, after the equally impressive result they brought in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify from the Group G of Europa League.
A knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorans from making his first appearance of the season until the equal result of 2-2 with Villarreal but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a catalyst for great things.
"This was a good point for us since Willarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old juves.
"We entered the game with the beliefs that we could get something and went out with a point.
We were probably able to win it towards the end but, all in all, an equal result was probably a fair result.
Probably they were better in the first half of the game while we went better in the second half.
Thursday will be a great European evening again.
We hope that we can achieve three points but this will be difficult because they have had a good outcome in their last game but, in the crowd after us, I am sure that we can continue to do our best and achieve a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, between everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but there is a sense of positiveness at present.
The team is good and boys are very happy; training is good.
I hope we can do our best now, forget the last season and succeed."
Women are concerned about this fear related to retirement savings
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be supervised, few people were talking to their family members about this.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said that they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to be a family member who takes them, but they're not taking steps to have a conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Life Insurance business.
You should start that way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes well in advance.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you will receive treatment, as those options may be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Get your financial adviser: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a life insurance policy with a hybrid value of money to help cover these costs or make self-insurance with your own good - provided you have money.
Take a decision after discussing your long-term legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Find a healthcare proxy to select a reliable individual to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
In addition, consider a proxy for your finances.
Select a person who trusts to make financial decisions for you and be sure that your accounts are paid if you are disabled.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan for you to be ready.
"Not only are the finances involved, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make that plan ready."
A man has been hit several times by air gun-tips in IIfracombe
A man has been hit several times by gun-throws as he was walking home after a night abroad.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of IIfracombe, Devon, when he was hit by a throne in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "a random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not a threat to his life and the police called for witnesses.
Terremots and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, said the officials, with the number of deaths expected to increase.
With damage to the lines of communication, the aid officials could not obtain any information from the fate of Dongala, which is an area north of Palu which is closer to the earthquake centre with a strength of 7.5.
In Pallu, more than 16,000 people were evicted following the disaster.
These are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, about the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawesi, located at the edge of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit the city, it was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Longgala is a right to extend over 300 km (180 km) of the coast to the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The response, an administrative region under a province, had a population of around 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the economy of the Central Province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
The nickel mine is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Moroal, on the coast of the other side of Sulawesi.
According to the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia, Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
In 1996, tsunami also hit the west side of Dongala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Ring of the Pacific Semitic Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake hit 14 countries on the west coast of the Aceh province of Indonesia in the upper part of Sumatra, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and at the beginning of April.
Hundreds died on the Island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a force of 6.8 hit the southern part of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, which triggered tsunamis that hit the southern coast hard, killing almost 700 people.
2009: Terremot with a force of 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 hit one of the islands of Mentawai, beyond Sumatra, which triggered tsunamis at a height of 10 metres, destroying tens of villages and killing around 300 people.
2016: A low earthquake hit Piedie Jaya's response in Aceh, which caused destruction and panic as people remembered in the 2004 earthquake and deadly tsunami outbreak.
This time no tsunamis were triggered, but more than 100 were killed due to damaged buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the top of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin Arrestat on Domestic Violence Prosecutions
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of attack.
Pallin, aged 29, from Wesila, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, who intervened in a domestic violence report and resisted arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when female learners tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her hand.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su Pritreal Facility and is being held on an unsafe bond of $500, reported the KTU.
He appeared to the court on Saturday, declaring himself "certainly, not guilty" when asked to give his motive, reported the network.
Palin is facing three Class A crimes, i.e. he can be imprisoned for up to one year and has to pay a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of a Class B crime, which is punishable by a day of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been made against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veteran Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with a domestic attack, interfered with the report of a domestic violence crime, and held a weapon in his possession while he was drinking in connection with the incident.
His girl alleged to have hit her with the pon in front of her.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by the veterinary groups following a comparison between the violent behaviour of her son and the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Terremote and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with a strength of 7.5 triggered tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not working with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck only a little outside the centre of Sulawesi located in the north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Videos showing the moment of impact are circulating on the media.
Hundreds of people had been gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore with great force.
Federal prosecutors are asking for the suspected terrorist attack of NYC to be sentenced to a rare death penalty
The federal prosecutors in New York are asking that Sayfullo Saipov who is suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people who have been sentenced to death - a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a rental truck of Home Depot to carry out a road attack for bicycles along the West Side Highway in Lord Manhattan, by flying in October to the people walking and cyclists who were on his way.
In order to justify a death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intent to claim the death penalty, presented in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court's document, these two heads of the charge bear a possible death penalty.
Date of UN designation: 1 January 2015.
When describing the manner in which Saipov carried out this attack "skinned, cruel and immoral", the prosecutors said that the attack required "substantial pre-planion and meditation."
The notice of intent states that "Sayfullo Habibullavic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clives, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since New York's Southern District last launched a death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York's federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after having been found guilty of conspiracy to carry out an explosion to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of reserves in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he inspired himself to carry out the attack after he saw ISIS videos on his cell phone, depending on the accused's head.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, said the police.
He replied not guilty to 22 accused heads.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were “certainly disappointed” by the prosecution decision.
"We think that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a reason of guilt for life in prison with no possibility of freedom will only continue to prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defence team has previously asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
The MP Tory says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the conference in Tory, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the army of the people".
The former head of the Ukip said that politicians had to "feel under pressure" from Eurosextics - as one of the MPs of Theresa May himself who should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
The member of the government of the Conservative Party Peter Bonn told the demonstration in Birmingham that until now the United Kingdom "would have come out" if Mr Farage had been Secretary of the Brexit.
But the challenge facing Ms May to reconcile her highly divided positions was highlighted by Tories, who was not in favour of the Brexit, who joined a separate protest against the Brixit in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to keep her Chequers' compromise plan on the right track among the attacks by the Brexitiers, those against the Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted that, despite the negative reaction, it will continue to move forward to try to reach an agreement with Brussels - and force Eurosexists and the Labour party to choose between its package and "kaos".
Mr. Bone told the Rally Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted "to put aside the Chequers' plan".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be given a high social position and that he should be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have gone out so far," he said.
The MP Wellingborough added: "I will defend the Brexit but we need to discard the Chequers' plan."
When he declared that he was against the EU, he said: "We have not fought a world war to serve us.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bonn rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and must remain far from true."
Andrea Jenkyns, Tory's Brexitier, was also present for the demonstration, where she told journalists: "I want to just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The plan of the Chequers is not popular with the general public, the Opposition will not vote for it, not popular with our party and with our activists who are in truth those who go on the road and who first vote for us.
Please forget the Chequers' plan and start hearing."
In a message aimed at Ms May, she said: "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians should "feel under pressure" if they were to go back from the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to go back from Brexit and we're here today to tell them that "we won't let you go if you do this."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he said: "I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is at the point that goes back from the Brexit.
We are mobilising the army of the people of this country that has brought us success and will not spend until we have become an independent, self-government and proud UK."
In the meantime, those anti-Brexit walked in Birmingham before they made a two-hour rally in the centre of the city.
Following the launch of the group this weekend, a small number of activists visited fans in writing Tories Against Brexit.
Lord Adonis, who has a high social position in the Labour Party, mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with a party app as soon as the conference opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all the IT systems in place and technology for Canada and more, for a border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a whole farm.
The idea of a good Brexit does not exist," he added.
Warren intends to "carefully examine" the possibility of leaving for the presidential election
U.S. Governor Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections he will "examine carefully the possibility of leaving for the presidential election".
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the member of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts spoke about its future in a debate with citizens at municipal level in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will be re-elected in November against the representative of the State GOP Geoff Dihl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was in the centre of speculation that could replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with constituents who have been using the format of a debate with citizens at municipal level since Trump took office.
A person who attended the meeting asked her if she intended to attend the presidential election.
Warren replied that it was time "to women go Washington to repair our fragmented government, which includes a woman at the top."
Arrested in connection with the killing by firing of LSU Sims
Saturday, the police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that the suspect was arrested in connection with the shooting of the member of the LSU baseball Waye Sims that took place on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, aged 20, at 11 a.m. ET News Conference.
Friday they issued a shooting video, asking for help to identify the man who appears in the video.
Sims, who was 20 years old, was killed by a flight close to the campus of the South University on Friday morning.
According to 247 sports, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media "Wayde Sims suffered from a head injury and eventually died as a result."
Wayde came to defend his friend and was hit by a shooting by Simpson.
Simpson was asked questions and admitted that he was on the scene, that he had a weapon, and admitted to shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and held in custody in the Police Department of Paris Baton Rouge East.
Sims, a young man who had six feet and who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starters last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 grounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Luis Hamilton approaches to obtain the world title after his team orders gave him the victory vis-à-vis Sebastian Veletel
Saturday, from the moment Valteri Buttis qualified prior to Louis Hamilton, it became clear that the orders of the Mercades team would have an important part in the race.
From the position on the inside in the first row, Botts had a good advantage and almost abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Veletel to attack his partner.
It was the first one to enter the stopping zones and let Hamilton slip with the others in the last place of the group, something that would be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in the zone after another turn and exited immediately after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to move after a little action on a wheel which made it difficult for the Ferri driver to leave the inside freely because of the risk of falling back after a double movement to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen began from the rear row of the grid and was in the seventh place until the end of the first round at the end of his years and at the age of 21.
He was then in front of most of the race by not changing his tyres with a view to completing it quickly and exceeding Kimi Raikonen for the fourth place.
He eventually entered the stop area in the 44th round but could not step up his progress in the remaining eight rounds while Reikonen entered the fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valteri did his job very well throughout the weekend and it was a real penthouse said let me by.
The team did a really exceptional job to get first and second place," said Hamilton.
That Was a Serious Physical Behaviour
President Donald Trump made fun of Governor Diane Feinstein in a Rally on Saturday in connection with her insistence that she had not sought the letter from Christine Blasey Ford that she was accusing the nominated person of Supreme Court Bret Kavanaugh of sexual attack.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly direct the testimony given by Ford before the Senate of the Judicial Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "violable and disguising and not sincere."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and violent and not honest," he said.
"When you look at statements and disclosures of information and then say no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, have you disclosed any information?
Remember her answer... opened the document - "e, e, what is it?
No, you did not.
I didn't know anything."
Look, wait a minute.
We have revealed... No, we have not discovered," he added, while imitating the Governor.
Feinstein sent her a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and this was discovered earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the disclosure came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not open up her history," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep her confidential and I kept her confidential as she had asked."
But it seems that her rejection was not well received by the president, who, during the weekend rally, commented: "You know what I know, that was a really bad physical act.
He may not have looked, but what's the worst physical act I've ever seen."
While he continued his defence of the nominated person of the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three people, the president suggested that the Democrats were using allegations for their purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You are seeing the vitality, the dystagonism, they do not care who hurt, those who make the sticks in the wheels to gain power and control," said the president according to reports from Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 BelfAST Giants
Patrick Dwyer twice dark for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have compensated for the loss of the Week's Elite League against BelfAST Giants by winning the game against the same opponent 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants gained an advantage of two gouls early in the game with two attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney brought the same score for the team they were playing in his country before Dwyer regained an advantage for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard obtained the same score for Dundee before two gouls of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen confirmed their victory.
This was the third season's win in the Elite League for Adam Kefe players, after which many losses advanced to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
This was the fourth time this season that these two teams met, with Giants winning the three previous matches.
The first wave of Dwyer took place in the fourth minute at 3:35 at a step by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford taking the step while Beauvillier doubled the advantage four minutes later.
In what was an opening period with much action, Sullivan brought the team who is playing back in his country at 13:10 before Matt Marquart took a step to Cowney at 15:16 that brought the same score for both teams.
Dwayer made sure that Giants get an advantage up to the first puddle of the game when he made his second gooul of the night at the end of the first period.
The team playing in his country was reunited and once again thanks to Bouchard they again reached the other team with a strong gooul at 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran joined in helping Nielsen to give Dundee an advantage for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and ensured the win with the fifth gooul for his team in the middle of the last period.
Giants, who now lose four of their last five games, will play in their country against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic controller Dies to ensure that hundreds of people on the aircraft can escape from the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered to be a hero after he died to ensure that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people managed to land safely.
More than 800 people died and many were lost after a massive earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering tsunamis.
Strong attacks continued to dominate the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues’ flight to escape, 21-year-old juves Antonius Gunwan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower that was growing at Palu Airport, Mutaara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
It remained calm to ensure that the Bakki Air Flight 6321, which was at the time on the runway, could leave safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought it was breaking.
He died later in the hospital.
Spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirit, said that the decision likely saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we left this morning before the helicopter arrived in Pallu.
"When we hear about it we feel a great noise," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands by the country's disaster mitigation agency says that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is estimated that the number is still increasing because many bodies were still under crushing while many could not be reached," said the speaker of the Sutopo Puro Nugroho agency.
The waves that reached up to six meters destroyed Palu in which a mass dance will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance enters the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
mini-markets are being stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is working hard to help those who are still alive but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Pallu on Sunday and told the military in the country: "I am asking you all to work night and day to complete every task related to evacuation.
The Court of Justice of the European Union (CCN) reported on the implementation of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Aerial accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man is lost after the aircraft accident in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight in the Pacific Lake in Micronesia now states that a man is lost, after having previously said that the 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evicted from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement that from Saturday afternoon, she could not give details about where one male passenger was.
The airline stated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped to save passengers and other crew members after the aircraft hit the water when it tried to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday the officials said seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in a stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The US Airline and Naval Fleet both said that the Icelandic plane in the lagoon was a bit away from the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane exceeded the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane entered very low.
"This is a really good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to pass through the water that was high up until the emergency exit on the plane that was sinking.
He said that the flight assistants were clapping and shouting, and that he suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. Naval Fleet said that seafarers working closely to improve moll also helped rescue them by using an open boat to transport passengers to the shore before the aircraft drowned at about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
In addition, the Commission considers that the airport services agreement concluded with the airport operator was not in line with the market economy investor principle, since the airport services agreement was concluded between the airport operator and the airport operator.
Analyst presents an evening schedule in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday the prosecution concluded its evidence on the case in the new process of a man who is accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Roulette witnessed for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described for the jury how he used mobile records to gather together information on the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19-year-old, on the night of her death.
Roulette said that he had received localisation data from several mobile phones who showed that Telelis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted his earlier statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the cell data showed that he was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and witnessed that he was not in the city at the time.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said that that night was in Sanford's truck, Sanford said that he was "he's lying, since my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they knew each other only one week.
Roulette said that some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his mobile phone.
"He deleted it from his life," said Hale.
Defence is scheduled to start its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the process to pass to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
Three hip hop artists must challenge the negative gender perspective by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, argues that the hip hop has moved beyond its origins of political messages and is addressing social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make the hip hip conscious again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Comon saw a recent resurrection in the United Kingdom with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nanny from NY drives a couple who chased her after a message "Raziist"
Nancy from New York is pushing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after he accidentally received a message from the mother who was complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny being racist, comparing the cause with "extremation."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed regret when she learned that the new child-career, Giselle Maurice, was a dark carnage when he arrived on his first working day in 2016.
"LEEEEEEEEEONE OTHER SINGLE PERSON," wrote Ms Plasco-Flexman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent him to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After noting her serious mistake, Plasco-Flexman felt "cool" and expelled Ms. Maurice, saying that her predecessor, who was an African-American, had not done her job well and that instead she was waiting in the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for her one working day and was then sent home by Uber.
Now, Maurice is pushing the couple for compensation in respect of dismissal, and is requesting compensation of $350 per day for the six-month live-in position for which she was initially employed, although without a contract.
I want to show them, listen, I can't do such things," she told Post Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple attacked statements that they were racist, saying that Ms Maurice's expulsion was the most reasonable thing they could do, fearing that they could not trust her after they defended her.
"Martie sent her something that she did not intend to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist people," Joel Plasco said to the Post.
"But if you trusted your children in the hands of someone who spoke to you with a mouth, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn?
And come."
When comparing the case with "extortion", Plasco said that it had been only two months since his wife had the baby and was "in a very difficult situation".
"Are you going to accuse someone like that?
It's not nice to do," he added the investment banker.
While the legal case is ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly announced to the couple on the social media, urging them for their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not relate to a talking ors
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in someone's shoes that are reading it for the first time before it is published.
"It is truly fun to know what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman of the BBC before he was inspired to write the book of the children from a small game organ, would certainly have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "pleasant but a little upset" after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was proud of his eventual success although he never talked about it.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't filled with himself," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like when you had a child to get something: it would be proud of them even if it wasn't you who had achieved something.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in that way.
Although he was the creation and his imagination, he always gave the substance to Paddington himself."
My son was dying and I had to give her the last peace on the phone
As soon as her daughter's lessary was taken to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked to save her life but it was all in vain.
"Nad was calling regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to live," said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a call from Nad to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to give her the last peace.
And that is what I did.
I told her, "I love you so much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicines doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were decreasing and leaving her system slowly.
She had died a little of the time before and began to divide everything.
All I could do was sit down and wait, knowing that all of this is happening.
I could not scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I've really had to hold back."
Eventually, Ms Ednan-Laperouse, who had been crying so far for the loss of her daughter, went up on the plane along with the other passengers - who did not know the difficult situation she was experiencing.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had a low head, and the tears began to fall all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt a great sense of sympathy towards Nad.
That he needed my love and to be told.
I knew how much he loved her."
Post cards of distressed women to avoid suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost someone dear because of suicide are working to prevent others from getting rid of themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were putting cards on the Welsh bridge with inspiration messages and telephone numbers that people could call for support.
Tyler, Ms. Davis' son, was 13 when he started to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Ms Davis, 45 years old, living in Lydney, said that her son was a promising joke with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew for his smile.
They always said that his smile would turn on every room."
However, he had to quit work before he died, because he was found "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Brother Tyler, then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had committed suicide.
Ms Davis said, "I'm always afraid this will be the cause of another bad event."
Ms Davis created cards, "to inform people that there are people you can open your heart to or meet, even as a friend.
Don't put it into silence - you need to talk."
Ms Humphreys, who has been a friend for years, lost her partner Mark for 15 years, not too long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or so," she said.
"In days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day it was very bad--when the children opened their gifts he made no contact with them with his eyes or anything like that."
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they want to fight her: "Let it be empty in the family.
It separates us.
But all of us want to go on with our lives and fight."

In addition, the Commission considers that the measures in question do not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.
"I said, if we could get something like what he called for – a limited-time, limited-purpose investigation – maybe we would bring a little unity," said Mr. Flack on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be "crowding" among a party parallelist who raised the roots.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their return is entirely due to the choice of time.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November - if, as expected, the Republicans do not go well, in that case they will be severely weakened in their attempts to put the man who they want to be elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was taking the phone to call the Senate, to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and who met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI presents its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, where they currently occupy a position 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, Vice-President, to vote and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
Number of deserts in North Korea "reduce" under Kim
The number of North Korean deserters for South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, said South Korean legislator.
When quoting data from the South Side Ministry for Unification, Park Byeong-seug said that last year there were 1,127 changes in the party – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates that human smugglers were demanding were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of the deserts from the North Side are ever offered South Korean citizenship.
Seeul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most of them flee by crossing China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross compared to the Demilitarised Area (DMZ) which is highly protected between the two parts of Korea.
China views the deserts as illegal migrants instead of refugees and often sends them back to their country by force.
North-South relations - which are technically still in war - have significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stagnant denuclearisation negotiations.
This took place after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards the Korean nuclear-hazard-free peninsula.
But Saturday, North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho committed to the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, in no way will we be the first to unilaterally remove weapons," said Mr Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bert Kavanaugh "isterical," saying that he is unable to work in the Supreme Court
The leaders of a minority of the House Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the Supreme Court Mr Brett Kavanaugh "isterical" and said that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because of his temporary behaviour.
Pelosi made these comments at an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't think of the fact that if a woman were ever to behave that way, they would say "sterical," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanagh's testimony before the Judicial Committee of the Senate Thursday.
Kavanah emotionally rejected the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were young.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes he was even crying and screaming when he was talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "accusation of the groteska character and coordinated" organised by the liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton has lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's witnesses had proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, because he had shown that he had prejudices against the Democracies.
"I think he qualifies himself with those statements and the way in which he went after the Clintons and the Democracies," she said.
Pelosi was moved when she was asked whether she would attempt to accuse Kavanaugh if confirmed, and whether the Democrats would achieve the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say something -- if he's not telling the truth to the Congress or the FBI, therefore he's not able, not only to be in the Supreme Court, but even to be in the court that is currently in it," said Pelosi.
Currently Kavanaugh is a judge of the D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about the potential decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as it is considered conservative justice.
In its confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether it would change certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It is not appropriate for a person with stereotic prejudices to go to court and wait to say, "very well," said Pelosi.
And Women Need to Exercise Their Authority.
It is a fair verbal attack, months and years of anger, and she cannot say what she should say without crying.
"We cry when we get up," I said to the rich Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think this is a rare thing, what do you say?"
She added, "She has helped me a lot of a woman who was embarrassed in another place, who said that she would also cry when she was raised, but developed a technique that meant that when she was raising and starting to cry, she would tell the person she was talking to, "I'm probably thinking that she's sad because I'm crying.
I'm raised."
And then he did not stop.
And I thought it was brilliant."
The crying is permitted as a way to get out of his great anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of one of the first jobs I had, in an office dominated by men, where one of them found myself crying in indescribable anger, was when an older woman took me through the crevice of my neck - a cold manager I was always afraid of - and carried me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know that you're angry.
They think that you are sad and feel happy that they succeeded in hurting you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Democratic Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was leaving for the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in a relationship outside of marriage on a boat known as Monkey Business and emerged from the election, Ms Schroeder, a highly-rabed, concluded that there was no reason why she did not explore the idea of issuing herself for the presidential election.
"That wasn't a well-intended decision," she said to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who were going out for election, and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called it "White Snow and the Seven Nani."
As this was at the end of the campaign, she was back in fundraising, and therefore she swore that she would not be out for election if she did not make $2 million.
It was a battle lost.
She discovered that some of her supporters who would give $1,000 to the men to her would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'll take any discount?" she said.
When she made her speech in which she announced that she was not going to launch a formal campaign, she was so excited – so grateful to the people who supported her, raised by the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and to target voters instead of delegates, and linked to sex - that she was caught.
"I probably thought I had these strong brakes," reminded Ms. Schroeder about the way the media reacted to it.
"You thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my grave?
"Is she crying?"
How the US-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The numbers of trade-war opening air bombs between the United States and China were disturbing, and while the battle remained to end, a misunderstanding between countries could be beneficial for long-term Beijing, say experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, gave the first warning earlier this year by taxing the main Chinese exporters including solar panels, iron and aluminium.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting items amounting to $200 billion (€150 billion), effectively taxing all goods entering the United States from China.
Beijing was retorted at the same time, while more recently it was presenting charges of five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has pledged to agree with the US every time, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy of the world will exceed in the near future.
The fact that Washington takes a step back means accepting requests, but publicly the fact that China leaves the US will be too embarrassing for Xijping, the Chinese president.
However, experts say that if Beijing works carefully, US trade war pressures can support China positively in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to start economic chaos in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what the viewers previously acknowledged," said Abigail Grace, research partners focusing on Asia in the New American Security Centre (Centre for New American Security), a reflection group.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it stands ready for voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate terrorist-destructed areas to restore normality.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees in the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another 6 million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime welcomes help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsoring the session.
Europe embraces Ryder Cup win in Paris
Team Europe won the Rider Cup 2018 against Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in a European land and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title again when the Danish master's team Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points that it needed to win the US.
Phil Mikkelson, who is prominent in the United States, who fought all the time, gave his cup of water in the 16th par-3 hole, thereby giving his game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian Golfer Molinari featured in all his rounds, and became 1 out of 4 players who have never brought 5-0-0 since the current format of the ceremony began in 1979.
American Jordan Speth lost 5&4 against the player at least on the European team Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest-level player, Dustin Johnson, brought 2 and 1 for Ian Poulter of England who played in his final Ryder Cup.
An eight-Rider Cups Veteran, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the best European player of theage that has ever been here with 25.5 points along his career.
"I don't usually cry but today I couldn't hold.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy, very happy that I got back the glass.
The team is everything, and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia excited after the European victory.
He passes the tort to his comitrijot partner, John Ram, who won the legend of the United States golf 2&1 Roger Woods in singles play on Sunday.
"The incredible pride that I feel, which I won for Roger Woods, when I grew up to follow him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now has a record of Ryder Cup 13-21-3 along his career.
Strange statistics of one of the best players ever, which won 14 main titles, the second after Jack Niklaus only.
Team USA fought all the weekend to find those parts of the golf course with the exception of Patrick Red, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-calibre golf all the time.
The U.S. master Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his team, "I am proud of these men, they fight.
There was a time this morning when we put some pressure on Europe.
Argumentate.
To Thomas we drop the hat.
He's a very good master.
His 12 players played very well.
We will join again, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
To these 12 Jews I love and I am proud to be a master.
You have to grab the hat and head.
Play better than her."
