The Welsh Mies were afraid of ‘ looking into the mirror ’
Some EMs were troubled by the idea that their name should be addressed to the Med.
The issue arose because of the plan to change the name of the congregation to the Welsh Parliament.
M.M.s in the political world are concerned about the possibility of making fun of him.
According to one Liberian MM, his group was worried that "the Tedbullipe and the Pedope" would come in contact with him.
To non-Welsh readers: Welsh Tedbleup is a fool, and Pedoliopi has been subjugated.
According to one P.M., the group as a whole "is not happy" and suggested options.
According to the Welsh fundamentalist, their group has a "receptive mind" on the change of name, but it is a short synonym from MW to MP.
Here welsh's letter is similar to the one read in Yorkshire's English alphabet.
The Commission, which is now in the process of introducing the same changes, states: "The final decision of the members of the board is indeed to be taken by any editors who explain what they are called.
The law of the Welsh government gave the Welsh Congregation the power to change its name.
In June, he published a public consultation on which he received broad support to call the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of MM, the Commission has chosen members of the Welsh Parliament or WWIMPs, but the option of MWI has been supported by the majority in public consultation.
MMs are offering openly interchangeable options, but it is possible that reaching the agreement for Ellen Jones, the president of the current presidency who is expected to introduce the subtle laws within weeks.
These include laws on the expulsion of MEMs and the drafting of the committee's regulations, including other changes in the functioning of the board of directors.
The question of who should be called the MMs when they argue on the law is the final one.
The Macedonians chose to change the name of their homeland during the time of Riverdam
On Sundays, voters make a choice to call their country's name the Republic of Northern Macedonia."
The public election was to resolve the decades-long conflict with Greece in its own province, Macedonia.
Atenas has repeatedly objected to her request to be a member of Io and Nato, pointing out that the name of her northern neighbor indicates that there is a question about her state.
President George Ivanov of Macedonia, who is opposed to the choice of name change, stated that he is not interested in it.
However, senior minister Zoran Zayev is said to be an easy-to-pay name change by supporters of Rifrendu, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, to be a member of Io and NATO.
St. Martin’s bells were safely absorbed in the struggle of the Harlem churches
"I spoke to the elders on history every corner of the bonabbit and church," said Mr. Adam.
"Today none of them are."
They have said that it is possible to get lost.
Today, "people are socializing differently," he said.
"Borns are no longer local living rooms where people regularly walk."
They are afraid that, as the leaders estimate, the money from selling property to the churches will not last long, "and they are in a place where there is a real delay."
In addition, churches can be replaced by apartment buildings full of people who do not care for local temples.
"The majority of people who buy common homes in this area will be white, "and therefore we cannot expect these churches to close because most of the people who come to these common houses will not be members of these churches."
Both churches were previously built in white congregations as the Harlem of Blacks, by the city community in 1870, St. Martin, ten years later.
The main white Methodist assembly came out in the 1930s.
A recent black congregation has taken over the ownership of the building.
Saint Martin was arrested by the Black Council, led by the priest John Howard Johnson, who led an audience of merchants on Harlem's main market, which was established to hire or raise blacks.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged, but when Father Johnson planned to rebuild the believers, he had developed a symphony instrument.
The priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and the successor of St. Martin, called the top of his musical instrument "Calls of the Poor".
The owner's musical instrument has been described as something else: "Cultural wealth" and a non-historical "historic instrument".
At the University of Michigan, professional Tiffany Nigi, and 18 years ago the Riverside Church was also the world's first professional musical instrument that was played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who had moved to the world's largest musical instrument.
According to Mr. Marywezer, Saint Martin has not replaced him.
In the past few months, some of Saint Martin's activities have been carried out by church leaders and others by the complex legends of archaic characters and contractors from the country's evangelical council.
The council, which was founded by the church leaders, wrote at the end of the country's sermon that the church wanted “to pass on its expenses to the office” even though the department did not participate in the process of hiring the buildings and the contractors.
Some believers complain that there is a problem of privacy in the country's sermon.
Asa, the 13 - year - old who had been swimming for a lobster in California, suffered permanent damage
On Saturday, officials reported that at the beginning of the Lobster era in California, Asa was hit by a 13-year-old boy who was swimming to catch a lobster.
The damage occurred just before 7 a.m., near the coast of Incinnitas on the Beacon coast.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV Sandigo that they spent half an hour on Saturday morning talking to their friends, hearing the boy scream for help, and swimming with the group to get them out of the water.
Hamel initially thought it was a pleasure to catch a lobster, but they found that he was screaming, "I was touched!"
‘ I’m touching you! ’
The whole package was opened, and Hamel said they immediately noticed it when they arrived with his son.
"I cried out to all people to get out of the water." Hamel added.
He was taken by plane from the Radi Children's Hospital, where he was on the dangerous list of children in San Diego.
The species of Asalim al-Amal, which was the cause of the disaster, is unknown.
According to the media release, the life-saving Katan Larry Giles had been on the scene a few weeks earlier, but it was considered not to be a dangerous species of Asa.
According to Giles, the victim suffered terrible damage to the upper part of his body.
From the Ponto Coast of the Cazblad to the Suamis coast of Incinnitas, the authorities have shut down the coast for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 species of Asamilias in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sensby’s Prettiest Plans for the Yuké
With professional support from the work force in Senesbry, bots, superdressers, and Debenhams are packed with large store-tops.
As fashion and domestic sales decline, as they continue to grow to the market in Yuké, the largest beauty store is being tested in 11 stores across the country, and if this is successful the following year, they will be taken to more stores than this.
Supermarkers that have made money on beauty have come to the rescue once for TVs, heatings, and furniture.
According to Seinsbury, for the first time, it doubles its sales of beauty, including brands such as Rivlon, Ec, Twezerman and Dorn.
Starting with Lorell, Mibelin, and Burts Bees, the products that are now available find more and more different places than in bunds, such as Bots.
The supermarker also re-initiates the size of the MCP in order to produce the most highly needed vegetable-only products for young consumers.
The perfume store of Fragrance is also trying to cut both of the Seinsberry stores. The first of these was opened in South London last week, and the second was to be opened in Birmingham, Sele Oak at the end of this year.
On-line shopping and buying small-scale food in a suitable area each day means that the supermarkets should do more to persuade people to visit them.
According to the chief executive of Seinsbry, Mike Kupé, in his attempt to lure Aldy and Liddell with the fewer and more services and the non-food products, the Supermarker's sales chain appears to be a highly organized big store in various parts.
Senesbreen placed out the Argon outlets in hundreds of stores, and two chains were introduced two years ago to a number of houses, which have strengthened the sales of Grokers and made them more profitable.
The supermarquet failed in its attempt to reform the beauty and medicine houses in various parts of the past by making them a large store.
In the early 2000 ’ s, Senesbry tried to start with Bots, but it ended with a dispute over how to divide income from consumer stores in the supermarkets.
The new strategy came after the 281-degree seminar sold the home three years ago to Selecio, the owner of the Lloyd Drug Chain.
According to Lloyd Laroche-Posey and Vinchi, gift-careers, including products such as credit and credit, have a large role to play in the project by adding credit bonds to four stores.
"We have changed our beauty and enthusiasm to raise our customers in the area, ” says Paul Mills-Hicks, business director of Censbory: "We have changed the shape and the mood of our beauty models.
We have also spent money on highly trained colleagues, who are prepared to give advice.
"The brands we have are designed for each interest, and their surroundings and conveniences, that is to say, we are now a reasonable haven of beauty, which is a challenge to the old style of shopping."
After 11 million agreements were issued by Holly Willowbee, Peter Jones was ‘ very angry ’
Dragin's star Peter Jones, TV offerer Holly Willogby, focused on a new contract with Marks and Spencer and Etive, which he had signed with his lifestyle brand business for 11 million years, and he 'was very angry'.
For them, Willogby has nothing to do with furniture and exchange.
The trade of the couple was connected to Guenez Paltrow, the Gop Brand.
In Instagram, 37-year-old Zis Morning's offerer announced that she was emerging.
In order to focus on her new contract with Marks and Spencer and Etivie, Holly Willogby took the last minute out of his lucrative lifestyle brand business and upset Peter Jones.
According to sources, at a tense meeting held in Marlowe, Beijing, the capital of the state, Johns was ‘greatly upset’ when the golden TV man said she had nothing to do with household goods and trades for them.
The business was linked to Guenez Paltrow, a Gop Brand business that was estimated to have doubled the wealth of 11 million.
When 37-year-old Willogby announced that she would leave Trollin in Instagram, Jones went from Britain to a vacation home in Jette.
According to one source: "Truley Holly was one of your top priorities.
It was her long-term job to spend the next ten years.
Her decision shocked everyone involved in the matter in a very real way.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, and it was too close to start.
The warehouse in the capital city of Marlo is filled with goods ready for sale.
The next morning, one of Britain's most famous bankers, expressed his belief that the release of this man would cost millions of dollars to his homemade organization, thereby delaying his further successful journey in a subtle way.
As a result, he may end his long-term partnership.
Willogii and her husband, Dan Baldwin, the mother of three children, are close to arresting John and his wife, Tara Cap.
Willogii's relationship with Cap was further strengthened in 2016 and 52-year-old John was chairman in March.
The Capes Hollywood Tugzer and Jones have a 40 percent share in the Bald Win TV Project.
Willowgie will be a ambassador for M.S. Brand, thus replacing Ant Mac Partelin, who is present at the I.V.I.M.A.
Johns' immediate sources stated that last night they would not "be willing to comment on what's less about him".
Amazingly, after a discussion, both of us fell in love.
He laughed at the criticism he received from the news media because of some of his "presiding unexpected" comments and thinking of something positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so busy?
"This is the voice of the new news reader."
"I don't give up on anything."
Kim is happy, as he explains, at the second meeting, and this meeting is the first month of the month in Singapore to make the trip to Northern Korea, where he was hosted by Trump.
But Nicürer stood by an agreement to do so.
The high diplomat of North Korea, Ri Ng Hu, spoke with various world leaders at the United Nations Conference, three months after the June meeting in Singapore, which the General Assembly stated had failed to pay attention to the "corresponding response" to the arms survey by the North American countries to North Korea.
According to him, America continues to ban us in an attempt to force us to the contrary.
The long speech of Trump raised good things.
He said we're getting along well with North Korea.
He had been leading us to a war with North Korea.
Millions could have died.
We are now able to establish good relations.
According to her, they have achieved the same results in their advanced efforts to improve their relationship with Kim, and this remains to be seen with the launch of rockets.
They said that they would disagree when asked about creating an external relationship with Kim.
Trump, they have pointed out that it is easier to be president than to bring 10 thousand people into the crowded hall, and that there are now about 200 people in the hall.
Hundreds of people died from tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia.
It was stated that non-governmental organizations in foreign countries would not need help following the earthquake of Loom Book.
Although 10 per cent of the residents of Lom Bock were displaced, no national threat was reported.
As Mr. Sambing put it, "on many occasions there is no need to seek international help, and this is very difficult."
When Sev The Children organized a group to travel to Palu, there was no doubt that foreign experts could be involved.
According to Mi/R Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Emergency Agency, Indonesia’s authorities were making a statement that there was a chance that international agencies could be involved in the event.
Just as Indonesia does at various times, this earthquake has been a sad failure.
Although the H.N. was hit by the H.N. tsunami, tents were heavily beaten, but few on other coasts.
Although the fact that the tsunami has not been called in Palau has not produced much results, death has played a major role.
It wasn't easy to travel from one island to another in Indonesia even in good times.
A natural disaster is more complicated than a natural disaster.
The ship at the Bock Hospital was on its way to help the victims, but it would take at least 3 days to reach it.
President Jako Widodo promised to improve the development of Indonesian infrastructure during the election process, which cost much money on roads and railways.
But the lack of individuals who make a fund is threatened by the M/R Jakoon administration as an obstacle to the next year's election.
M/R Joko is under increasing pressure, and a larger number of Muslims are becoming conservative.
In a street fight of more than 1 thousand people, Christian and Muslim facades have been killed, and 10,000 have been displaced, and the posters have been used as bells, bows, and other instruments to fight.
Look: Daniele has taken the initiative to ignore
On Saturday, in a game with Chelsy in Stanford Bridge, London, Daniel Strich was released from making a point at Premier, where he had taken his 89-minute turn.
Gerdán Shackery, a group of 1 to 0, was leading Sterlich, who had arranged 30 yards to go to Golsh outside Chelce District.
When he took control of the ball on his foot, he slammed it and hit the target.
The experiment was successful, and the ball fell on the top of the right tracker.
Kepa Arizabalagan has fallen on the net.
When Stritch explained to LeverpololFC.com, we were trying to control and set goals for the ball, and people like Jacques are playing hard ahead, and I have set myself up more and more a goal.
When Cantay came to me, I saw only one of her balls, and I immediately tried to hit him without thinking.
Belgium's planet Eden Hazard, which he counted in 25 minutes, was leading to the middle of the game with 1 to 0.
The blue attacker was the backman of the ball he had passed on to Matthew Avachi.
Kovaci quickly gave up her ball and returned to my average.
Then, a fine ball was given to Hazard's audience, which brought him closer to the goal zone.
He passed the plants on to his left foot and set a goal for Alson Beckery in Liverpool.
At St. Paulo University in Naples, Italy, he met Naples at 3 p.m. on Fridays at Campion's League.
In London, Thursday at 3 p.m., a video was broadcast by Europa League Elchetsey.
In Indonesia, the number of people killed in a tsunami accident reached 832.

In the last Friday and 7.5 earthquakes, many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings and up to 20 feet high, and the Egensian spokesman Sotopo Purua Nugreho reported on the news conference.
The remains of many buildings have been found in the city of PALU, where over 380,000 people live.
Following the passing of a woman's life, the police arrested 32-year-old suspect.
The woman's body went to Barken, and Mercid's presence this morning was followed by a crime investigation.
A 32-year-old man was found wounded on the street of John at 7.55am, in Grayson Weiss, in addition to being arrested.

According to a police spokesman, the woman found dead in Barkenhead stated that she was wanted.
Today, friends who know the woman from the afternoon are coming to the meeting and are asking where she was in the morning.
The investigation revealed that the police were continuing and that they would publish the next information on a continuous basis.
Police have been told that it is neither possible nor impossible to get into or out of a taxi driver's apartment in Grayson.
When he saw it, he was shocked.
According to the residents, they were told that they should enter the apartment, perhaps waiting hours.

Cromwell's monument was a good memory of the history of Parliament.
What was envisaged was the type of justice of many traditional and religious English gifts, which the Taliban had organized and given to the Persians.
The KRW community describes the account as a fool and as trying to rewrite history.
According to John Gold Smith of the Cromwell Community, the current debate is about to take away the statue of Oliver Comwell, who stands outside the West minister's palace.
England’s civil war, which many do not accept, was not ordered by Iaim in Cromwell.
The weaknesses of the Krom whale can be attributed to paying for the works of Thomas before him.
The way that Saar William H. Cromwell described it is a reflection of the evidence and history of the 19th century, which has led many to respect.
"Cromwell was highly respected, especially in the 19th century, with pressure from outside parliament, especially from the royal family.
It continues to be a historical debate on what will be the most accurate and accurate account of the case.
Of course, the conflict of the mid-17th century was the shape of our country's further development gap, and Cromwell is a well-known figure representing a page of that division.
The successes are celebrated and remembered as a king on his throne.
The killer's pig has been hit by a Chinese arse that has broken down a Chinese arguably.
According to the local media, in a market in southwestern China, a farmer was caught up in an attack on pigs.
Mourning Post, South China, reports that on Sunday, Yuan reported that he was found in the Guishu district of Ljupanshou, where he was found on the market.
In China, on May 30, 2005 the owner of the pig, in Zing Kingway, was ready to fight the pig vaccine.
Last Friday he and his cousin had sold 15 pigs from the Uwan state to the market.
The next morning, his cousin was found dead, and his neighbor's donkey door was opened.
According to him, the big pig had been transfused with blood.
Forensic research has found that, according to the report, the weight of 550 pounds of pig was caused by the murder of the family.
"My cousin Agur was bloody and injured" was named "Wow" by the victim, as described by Goliag Evning News.
Yuan Hms. 4.40 Am came into the market to feed the pigs with images left behind by security cameras.
An hour later, the body was found.
The man was said to have been killed by an animal that was neither Juan's nor his cousin's.
According to one police officer, he said that he had been locked up to protect the pig from harm to others, and the police added that he was collecting information.
Yuan families and shoppers are discussing the level of compensation that has been paid to the deceased.
Although there have been occasional cases of pigs affecting people, there have been reports of cases of cases in which pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and a man on their farm in Massachusetts, causing him serious harm.
About 10 years ago, a pig weighing 650 pounds joined a Welsh farmer until his wife threatened the animal.
In 2012, until an origon's farmer eats of the pigs, as a manitoba farmer told the CBC news, pigs are not usually aggressive, but they may be "inciting" blood.
"They're playing."
They're like the baby, they're asking too much... they're not going to hurt you.
Only to show proper respect, he said.
Rosa’s remains cause large, heavy rains in the southwestern USA
As foretold, the Rosa storm is weakening as it travels over the cold summer waters of northern Mexico.
However, in the following days, Rosa will bring a flood of rain in north-west Mexico and south-west USA.
Rosa had been traveling 85 miles per hour, category 1 hurricane since 5 a.m. on Sundays, and on the southwestern part of Mexico, Punta Eugene, 385 miles.
On Sunday Rosa is expected to travel north.
In the meantime, it is starting to take shape on the peaceful ocean and head east toward the west coast of the USS. On Monday Rosa, as a tropical storm approaches Beja California, deep tropical moisture toward the south-west of the USS begins to move north.
On Monday, Rosa brings a portion of Mexico's 10-inch rain.
Then, when the tropical moisture comes in contact with the greek, it brings a heavy rain in the southwest for the next few days.
Rain from 1 to 4 Inch in the area can cause severe flooding, drought and landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona, brings about between 2 and 3 in hours of rain.
Most of the area of Arizona is expected to be rained from 2 to 4 Inch.
There may be a flood with a rapid decline in the weather by means of the rain mixed with the tripical rain.
It is not very wise to walk into the desert when tropical rains threaten to occur.
Major rain valleys are becoming strong rivers, causing thunders to bring strong winds and dust to the area.
The approaching sarge brings some local rain on the southern coast of California.
Over half an inch of total rain can cause a moderate level of rainfall and moving roads.
This may be the first rain in the area during the wet season.
On Monday evening and Tuesday morning, before the rains begin to expand, some scattered tropical raindrops will begin to approach Arizona.
Deep rain spreads in all four corners from Tuesday to Friday.
As the Arctic cools, there may be some intense heat changes across the USS in October, but tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes this results in unexpected changes in temperature in a short distance.
A major example of unexpected heat differences is on Sundays in Central USA.
There is a close 20-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iwa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will try to re-establish it.
Most of the Central and Eastern EU is expected to have a warm start in October, from southern plains to north-eastern areas.
On Tuesday, New York City can reach 80 degrees, an estimated 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our forecast for the long-term climate shows that the first half of the year of October of the USSR is more likely to be hotter than the average.
More than 20 million people have seen the Brat Kavanah trial.
More than 20 million people have seen a remarkable witness on the television network on the television screen of a woman accused of sexual assault of the High Court of Hummour and the candidate Brat Kavanah and the alleged sexual assault of the 1980 ’ s, Christine Blacy Ford.
In the meantime, the political opposition continued, and the Brdasshurts have been reprogramming for the last minute, and the agreement was signed in Arizona by Senator Jeff Flick to conduct a week-to-week examination of the cases of the FBI.
Ford said that at a high-school party for the Senate Justice Committee, she is 100 percent sure that Kavanah had been beaten and tried to get rid of her clothes.
Kavanah said that he was 100 percent sure that he had not done so in their emotional testimony.
Nelson reported that it is estimated that Friday may have seen more than 20.4 million people.
The company was counting the average number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Chanal, and Fox Business Network and MSMBC.
The number of Networks, including PBS, CSPIN and Fox Business Network, has not been readily reached.
And Nelson also has problems measuring those who see him as an office.
To put that into a certain perspective, the viewer has the same amount as the game of football or the award of an academic.
Nilson says that in a day-long trial, Fox News canal, who strongly supported the Kavanach’s appointment, led all the Networks by 5.69 million average viewers.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
CBS 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MBM 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
After the trial, he continued at the highest level of his desire.
Flick was a central figure in the Saturday drama.
On Friday morning, after a statement by the late Republican Bureau that he would vote in favour of Kavanakh, he was drafted by CNN and CBS cameras as they tried to get hold of the opposition to go to the Justice Committee.
In the face of opposition, it has been transmitted by CNN that they have stood on the ground for several minutes.
A woman says, “I am standing right in front of you ”
Do they think that they are telling the truth?
"Many women have no power, but you have power," they said.
According to Flick, the office has issued a statement, and they can speak more during the committee's trial before the spine is closed.
It was when the Justice Committee voted for the entire Senate to vote on the candidates for the Council, that the Kable and the Broadcast Networks were all covered by a direct distribution.
But Flick says he can do this only by realizing that he will see the accusation made on the candidate the following week, as a few of the democracys have urged him.
Flick and his friend, after speaking with the Democratic Senator Chris Kuns, partially admitted.
After talking to Kuns and several senators, Flick made their decision.
Flick's choice has power, because republics will certainly not have the voice necessary to bring up the Kavanakhs outside the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation of the Kavanah charges.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘playing politics’ above the press.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May alleged that he was taking up his plan to move out of the European Union as a ‘player of politics’, as a violation of British interests and national interests.
Britain's Prime Minister Teresa May on September 29, 2018, entered the Burmingham Congregation, Britain.
In another interview on the front page of the newspaper, the former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, Britain, and the European Union attacked their plan to gather their own history, which was called "incompletely useless".
Weid Sims shot: The police took control of Dayton Simpson, a suspected player in Elsio's army.
The police, 20-year-old Wade Sims, an Elsio basketball player, seized the suspect of a shooting.
20-year-old Dayton Simpson explained that he had been arrested and later taken down to the prison on second degree suicide charges.
Officials have released a motion picture of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and he says he lost his eye when the police hit him.
The police took the lead from the beating site and reported that they had discovered the nature of Simpson's racism, reports the W.F.F.
When they visited Simpson, the police admitted that he had been shot to death by a bullet.
The fund is $350,000, reports The Advoket.
The Eastern House Rog reported first that the death of the Corner Bureau on Friday was due to a bullet in the head to the neck of Christmas.
The leader said that people who fled from the state of Lusheny have contributed to a special power, the state police's crime experiment, the South University police and local citizens' control of the suspect.
"Jo Aleva, the director of Elsie's athletics, is grateful for what he did to the local legislature for his hard work and justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
He was raised in front of his 6-footer by his father, Wayne, in a building that played Elsio's basketball.
Last time in a game, he recorded 5.6 points and 2.6 spots on average.
On Friday morning, Elsio's basketball trainer Will Weed said that the group was "highly hurt" and "in shock".
"That's what you're always worried about, "weed says.
The volcano poured ashes in Mexico City
The ash from the popocatile volcano reached the settlements of Mexico's capital and southern residence.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans that, after the eruption started, they would be away from the area and announced that within 24 hours, they had registered 183 gas outlets.
The centre was in charge of many heavy shoutings and earthquakes.
Images from social media show that the ashes were covered by car coverings in places such as the Mexican City of Zochimile.
In September 2017, geophysicists noticed a volcanic activity at 45 miles (72 km) from the capital in the aftermath of an earthquake that rocked central Mexico and 7.1.
Since 1994, the "Don Goo" has been on the move.
The police voted for freedom before the annual holiday, which was fought with cutaways.
On Saturday, after supporters of freedom clashed with the Ada police, six people were arrested in Barcelona, and thousands of people protested against the annual celebration of the Catalonia elections.
A group of supporters, armed with a band of white-and-pants covered with cotton, often set up a thick cloud of dust on the streets that are flooded by visitors.
At the end of the day, there was a fight, and the police used violence to stop it.
For many hours, pro-smoking groups sang, "No forget, no forgive," and those who supported unity sang, "Let Spain live forever."
According to the local newspaper, there were 14 people treated with minor injuries.
The tension in the area of the free seeker continued sharply after the October 1 census took place in Madrid and was celebrated by the bells.
Although the number of people who responded to the call was low, the electors chose to be very free.
According to Catalan authorities last year, about 1000 people were injured in the violent conflict that took place throughout the region to stop the police from voting at election stations.
On Friday, pro-liberal groups went through the night to defend the campaign against national police.
The protest campaign was held but took a different course.
The electricity expert and his wife said that they no longer hoped that the 68-year-old Narciss Termes Catalonia, who participated in the concert, would enjoy freedom.
"Last year we spent one of our best times in life.
I've seen my parents read with joy because they can vote, but now we're standing, ” they say.
Although in the past it has been possible to register a small victory over environmental choices, the parties that promote Catalanism have been unable to protect most of their prominent leaders, or themselves, from persecution or their role in the revision of the Declaration of Freedom and thereafter, as a result of which they are in prison awaiting trial.
According to 42-year-old Mechanic Huan Puig, who was taking a phone call to support the police, the conflict was sparked by politicians on both sides.
"More stress is on the rise," he explained.
On Saturdays, since last year, one of the nine Catalan leaders in the Pre-Court Prison announced that Oriol Huanqueras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalan, would compete in the European Parliament next year.
"We've been able to see from the Spanish government that being a candidate for a European election helps to observe and detect pressures when democratic values are lacking," he said.
LONNDDERI: A man is under arrest after the car crash
The three men in London, on their 33rd, 34th, and 39th days, followed a frequent hit by a car and were under control.
The case has been announced in the British Time Count by Thursday to around 19°30 Blainegard Crest.
Det Inspector Bob Blemings stated that the entrance door and the building were damaged.
It has been estimated that a bow may have been fired on the vehicle's compartment.
The attack by the flock enabled Livingstone to win a 1 l0 victory over Ringers.
Dolly's band's first goal has confirmed Livingston's victory.
Living Stone Rangers, who grew up to be the trainer of the Ibrax Club, was able to surprise the Rangers by signing Gerard, who had just been defeated by only two of the 18 games.
Garri Holtz, who supports Dolly's band, has forced him to be second in his class.
In Premierchipu, the next Sunday, the leader, Harts, is eight points ahead of the field without winning any games.
Prior to this, Ringer is hosting the European League in the field of Rapid Vena.
Living Stone has replaced former trainer Kenny Miller with six games, which are followed by uncompromising progress, under the direction of the principal trainer Holt.
Living Stone did not take advantage of the opportunity to play with his foreign team.
The Holtz group must expand its differences by using the Ringer's problem without losing sight of it.
Scott Robinson was turning his face towards Gol. Allan was, in turn, trying to catch up with Craig Haketz.
The concern of the Medda Group is that the guest group may be disturbed by the opportunity that the Ringers have had to play with them.
The role of being considered as great for the decision remains a long way off.
When the Rangers received a complete sentence, Living Stone, with a strong commitment, joined by Declan Gallagher and Robinson, Minga turned the ball that he had received from mid-field into a major.
Although the Rangers were often overstripped by ball controls, they were able to defend themselves, and their goal was greater than the calm of watcher Liam Kelly.
The situation continued the same way, but Alfredo Morelos used Heil on Kelly.
Scott Pittman has been in a conflict with Ringer's target guard, Alan McGregger and Ligaw Living Stone.
As Livingston's territory was repeatedly broken down and easily invaded, and Hecketts, who changed Glen Middleton's pressure, had the opportunity to have two severe penalties, especially one on hand.
He was an ‘extreme’ thinking when he played the Livingston game

Livingston’s Current Qualifications and Results
It is quite surprising that the very pre-emptive nature of the human race continues to be a matter of concern.
Especially after they came to the lead, their manners and activities did not change very much, but the revitalization of the group by Halt, who joined the group, was highly appreciated.
He has many heroes.
He was a giant, especially a successful member of the defense department. In other words, Manga Conner Goldsson and Joy Warllen tried them.
Ringers were motivated by games.
While they were good at Jard, they had a low score in relation to the Standards.
The lack of problem, pressure, and efficiency in their finalballs is enough to keep the group in the middle of the board and to pull it off.
Ordogan had a special reception in Cologne.
Turkish and German leaders attended the breakfast in Berlin (September 29) on Saturday, where a clear sky was seen and many were delighted.
President Erdogan's controversial visit to strengthen their relationship with Neto has reached today's final day.
He also advised about bringing your mother into the European Union on the basis of human rights, in Pres ’ freedom.
Ordogan has come to Colleen for a great victory.
The city is home to a number of Turkish people outside Turkey.
In contrast, the police explained the reason for the more than 25,000 marchers who went out of the camp in front of the Pakistani side, and the numbering of 25,000 were banned by the President's high-ranking leaders.
Hundreds of employed Erdogan's opponents have been heard, among them the hard-wish Kurdish, protesting Erdogan's policies and Germany's decision to accept the man.
The strongest opposition is that there is a distinction between those who are German-Turkish citizens and those who criticize visitors as heroes.

A storm known as Rosa could damage the city of Fonex, Lasvegas, and Salt Lake, but it could benefit from drought-affected areas.

Trump said that Kavanav is a very tired, uncooperative, and aggressive party.
"Counterly professional Kavanav voiced: "The democratic party's voting is to deprive itself of the position of the TICs, which is marked by the following cruelty and brutality,” said Trump, who elected Western Virginia, Welling.
Trump said: "Cavanav is a cause of disillusionment and anger in the selection process of the Democratic Party.
Kavanav replied that he did not knowingly and emotionally react to the sexual assault that he had filed on us as a child over a decade earlier, claiming that he had fulfilled his five-year term of five-year term Christine Blaise Ford before the Congress.
Ford's case was followed by evidence.
The president said on Saturday: "The American people have been able to see the youth, qualifications and motivation of the Kavanav. "
"Counterly professional Kavanav has explained to their supporters in Western Virginia that to give a voice to a person who has the best legal capacity for our time is to give a voice to a person who has knowledge of the law and a place of public service."
Whether the president is directly involved or not, the fact that he said so much about the Kavanav election is a matter of gaining support for the next mid-election.
"The most useful choice we've ever seen in our lives has been five weeks.
"I'm not running, I'm running well," he said.
"That is why I am everywhere ready to face big candidates."
Trump democracys are on the mission to "oppose and destroy".
The first practical choice of candidates for Kavanav, the Grand Old Party has announced to CNN that it will take place before Friday.
In Indonesia, earthquakes and tsunamis are expected to kill hundreds and to increase the number of deaths.
According to one authority, on Sundays, at least 384 people in Indonesia have been subjected to a storm, followed by a tsunami, followed by at least 384 people who have been stormed and relieved.
In the city of Palu, while hundreds of people were on a beach festival, the evening of a three- foot - or 18 - foot - high storm, with all that they could find, was the result of a riot and destruction of the blessing, including what they could see when the sun was setting.
A 7.5 earthquake followed a tsunami in the area.
"At the moment that the tsunami was threatened, satisfied people were continuing their normal activities along the shores of the sea, and they were not trying to escape.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, cars, logs, houses, hit everything on the ground, "Nuguho says, "This is not the only time the tsunami had traveled 800 km in a swath (497 miles in swath) before it hit the coast.
A few people have been able to survive the tsunami by climbing a tree, according to:
About 16,700 people were taken to 24 Palu stations.
A number of buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been broken, and a bridge has been surrounded by water, as shown by:
On Saturday, a minor earthquake continued to shake the city:
A series of earthquakes was heard in an area of 2.4 million people:
Indonesia's technology and apps estimate was 200 times higher than the atomic bomb dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s long and narrow ocean environment had done even more than it could, he said.
According to Nugoho, the damage was “extremely large, ” and thousands of employed homes, hospitals, and shops were destroyed:
The body of the victims was found under the ruins of buildings destroyed, including 540 wounded and 29 killed.
The death and destruction on the coast of the Dongala Sea, 300 miles (190 miles) north of Palu can be increased, and the location is close to the centre of the earthquake.
Since communication devices are out of work, there is no information that can be altered from the territory of the Congo, says Nugoho2.]
According to a Red Cross report, more than 300,000 people live in the area, "including the company's employees and good-doers have moved.
"This giant is sad, but it can get worse."
The Egensian tsunami has been given no information about Palun, but the waves had reached earlier, despite the authorities' warnings.
According to a video released on social media by an author, a man in a building was making known that the tsunami was approaching with loud noise and fear.
Within minutes, a walled tsunami reached the shore and carried cars and buildings
Routers failed to check the video image immediately:
The earthquake has made life-saving work difficult because of the use of electric lines in the PALU area.
From Jakarta and other cities, he is delivering relief supplies on a carrier plane, but as authorities have said, those who have been displaced are looking for food and other assistance in their operation.
The city’s air route was reopened for urgent work, but it continued outside until October
The city’s air route was reopened for urgent work, but it continued outside until October:
Indonesia's tsunami is more than 800 deaths.
It's very bad.
The people of the World Visas, who had been living in Angola, had come safely to the city of Palu, where their employees were sheltered in tents, but they were in great danger on their journey, according to Mr. Moba.
"Many houses have told me that they are useless," he said.
It's very bad.
At the time when aid workers came out of the territory, there was also a complaint that some experienced foreigners were forbidden to travel to Palau.
Foreign aid can come from Indonesia's law only after a national environmental disaster has been declared to be a continuing threat.
This has not yet been done.
"It is now known as the danger of a state, " said Indonesia's red cross spokesman Aulia Ariani.
"If the government shows it, that means that if it proclaims it as a national disaster, we will make ourselves available, but let's not say anything."
After Saturday’s earthquake and tsunami, Palu is on his second day, and friends and their families hope to see a miracle of those who have lost their lives in that dark and terrible disaster.
On Saturday a little boy was killed in a flood.
On Sunday, a woman who has been under two days of collapse has been saved.
Gendon Sunderdo, an Indonesian team trainer, was training two paraglyders for Asian Gems, which ended this month, but both were killed:
Others were students of Su, including Mr. Mandaghi, who had been arrested in Rwao and Chantel.
"As an experienced expert in Para Gliding, I am personally in great emotion and pressure.
Mr. Gendon, after hearing the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, wrote that the situation was once spread by the community in Prague, he sent a message from the Watts App, even though the hopes of the PAL athletes in Bitch Festivalo were being raised.
Only one gray check and one blue one.
" That means that his messages have not been delivered, " he said:

In Newport on the Live, thieves robbed the British employee of $26,750 when he was full of ATM money, according to a report by the Newport police.
Investigator Dennis McCarty announced by Press that the driver was opening up ATM, which is at the center of entertainment, and was preparing to bring in the full amount of money.

[1 Kanya West: Raperu has changed his name to me.
Rapper Kanya West is changing his name to me.
As to the change on Twitter, he wrote on Saturday: "The name of a person named Kanya West on the record. "
For a short time, 41 - year - old West had a nickname called Yeh, and he used the name Moniquer to the eighth of June's albums:
The change took place on Saturday before the new album was delivered directly to the public.
Even if Ariana Grande was scheduled to present her work the day, he announced that she would be replaced by her because she had been "dissociated with instability" and would be replaced by her.
Although the name was the professional word for the season, he had already said that the word was a religious symbol.
I believe that the word "I" has been mentioned repeatedly in the Holy Scriptures. He was interviewed by Big Boy, who replaced the English word "you".
"That's you, me and me, and that's us."
Cana, or the only one, has come up with our goodness, our badness, our controversy, and the reflection of which matter is ours.
The album is mostly a reflection of who we are.
He is one of many rappers who have changed their names.
Shon Coomb, a former P.D.D., announced on several occasions that he would prefer Love or Love Brothers:
The former West Colaporteur Jay-the-Jay-Zbactipal is called "Jay-Zkatippal" and "no wine" if you were to swear.
Mémello, Mexico, promised not to use Heil to the public
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, promised that the same cruelty would not be fought in his 50th speech on the anniversary of the brutal assault on students and students.
López O'Bradore made a Saturday statement in the Lattelolko square: "They do not use Heil as a weapon to destroy Mexican citizens.”
In this same courtyard, on October 2, 1968, some 300 left-wing politicians shot at those who had left the peace struggle and began to flee to Latin America.
López O'Bradore has made a commitment to support Mexican youth by providing monthly grants to university students and by opening up more liberal public universities.
The lack of employment and education facilities also claimed that youth are leading to organized crime.
The United States has to double its financial support to the Arctic Intelligence
Since China is increasing its involvement in the ART, American research and research needs to make twice as much money for Google, Microsoft, and Apple companies that have built the Investre and the Architectural Intelligence Specialist Kifu as they do today
The comment was followed by a series of AIA adverts by various U.S. government bodies. The country is even more prominent than the AA strategy.
But China has already announced its goal of becoming the number one in 2030 in the area of architectural intelligence.
"When other countries are very close, we are working to bring about a change, as Lee says. "
According to an interview with CBC this week, Li and CBC said that doubling financial support makes the next breakthrough American.
Lei, author of the book Professional Intelligence Superpair of China, published this month by Hogton Mifflin Harkort, a leading executive of the Cinvection Ventures Company (Cinvection Venture), one of China's Arctic Intelligence Campanese.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Melan, he founded the American Ottelo toy system, followed by Microsoft study and research and the operation of the Google branch of China.
As Lee announced, the former U.S. government, such as the Defensed Research Project, needs to remember the contribution made by the Agency’s robotics chain technology competitions and to determine the next generation
Researchers in the United States have noted that they must work hard to win government funds:
"It's not China, it doesn't take the corporate leaders, it's the companies," Lee says.
Fess Book, Google, and Microsoft have taken promising students to work on the architectural intelligence.
According to Lee, the change of the police will make a major contribution to China's theocratic intelligence efforts.
"I think Green card should be prepared for students working at the Artificial Intelligence P.H.I.
The Chinese State Council launched the program for the further development of IT in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Center provides financial support to education institutions, which means that the National Science Foundation and Lelo State Foundations allocate money to Riders in the Americas, although the quality of Chinese education works is low, says Lee.
At the beginning of this year, America's Defence Department set up the Joint Architectural Intelligence Centre, which will enable industry and education to participate, and White House has also launched a special committee for the Artificial Intelligence.
and this month announced the allocation of $2 billion to the project entitled the DARP and the IT Network.[2]
The NSF spends more than $100 million on private investment in the study and research of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation for the establishment of the National Securitical Commission did not record any activity this month.
The Macedonians voted for the change in the name of the country or for its continuation
Last Sunday, the Macedonians voted to decide whether or not the country was Republic of the North Macedonia, which, it is believed, would release the country’s membership of the European Union and NATO, which was the solution of the Greek marriage.
Similarly, Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, has used its right to vote to prevent it from becoming a member of the Union of NATO and of Europe.
Although the two countries have reached agreement on this name in June, they are opposed by national activists, who claim that the identity of the people of Macedonia Slavic is inferior to that of the masses.
As President Giorgi Ivanov said he would not vote in the Rivrandu, with a similar unheard campaign, the public expressed concern that 50 per cent of the population could be reached:
The question on the voicemail sheet reads: "They want to end their marriage to the Greek Union of NATO and Europe."
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that from among the countries that have broken down the decision, Macedonia is on the move to become a member of the NATO and European Union.
"Today I come here to choose what is best for my country tomorrow, especially young people in Macedonia live free under the shadow of Europe Union, because this makes life for all of us a success," said 79 - year - old Olivera Giogijavska in Skipji.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament have stated that they will be bought by the vote and will accept it as crucial.
In order for a name change to be practical, two-thirds of the members of Parliament must have a vote.
The country's Election Commission stated at 1 p.m. that there was no problem with election.
The Parliament voted 16 percent out of the election, and last year 34 percent opposed, but 66 percent of the registered votes voted in this election.
"I have come to give a vote because of my children, my home is Europe," 62-year-old Josie Tancheski, who voted in the capital city, Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zayev of Macedonia, their husband, Zuricha, and their son Dushko voted on the change of the name of the country in Macedonia on September 30, 2018, which helped to unite NATO and the European Union.
In Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small platform in front of the parliament and set up chairs in front of the tent.
“ We are with the Union of NATO and Europe, ” says Kovadakow, “but when we are mixed up, we keep our neck upright, not for the benefit of others. ”
"We are a poor country, but we have glory."
If we don't accept Macedonia, we will turn to China and Russia and join the Euro-Essian Union."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, being a member of NATO's country will bring much investment to Macedonia, where the number of unemployed people is over 20 percent.
After Zaev voted, he said: “It is my belief that more than 80 percent of our citizens support the European Union and NATO ”
According to him, the “Yes” results are proof of the next time ”
In a population survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Police Research Institute, 30 to 43 percent of the voters participated in the Rifrendu, and this showed that this was less than the number they did not vote.
Another public opinion poll conducted by Thelma, Macedonia, found that 57 percent of the respondents had received a vote on the following Sunday.
70 percent of the respondents said "Yes"
In order for the Rifrendu to succeed, one response would have to have one vote plus 50 per cent.
The collapse of the Rifrendu shows that the policy that has been used in the work since May last year, which has stood for the benefit of the Western government, has for the first time collapsed.
Look at: Mnachster City was concerned about the defenses of Bratton to make Agweiro the adult
On Saturdays at Ithead Stadium, England, Mr. Manchester City Brytin, was concerned about his defenses by Sergeio Agwero and Rahim Sterlin, who had won 2 to 0.
Aguero was following his 61-minute career as a fool.
As soon as the Argentine assault game began, he was given a fine ball from his superiors.
Before he was thrown into prison, he was running with the three Braitun defenses.
Next, Aguero found himself in the midst of his four greens.
Before entering the Bratton zone, he was attacked by a defenser
From this point on, he was able to accept Sterling on his left.
In contrast to the English attack, after directly backing up the football that the group had received, Agweiro was able to set a goal on the right side of Matthew Ryan, the guardian of the Britton goal, who hit Aguiro with his right foot.
Pep Gadiola said to the reporters: "He is struggling with the damage he has suffered on Aguero's territory."
"We've been talking for up to 55 or 60 minutes
And that is it.
"We are happy to have a goal in that situation."
Sterling created the first chance for the blue blues in the hard game of primierlig.
That goal was calculated in the 29th minute
Aguero has received the ball in a difficult situation in the Bryton District.
Then he warmly welcomed Leroy Sane, who is on the left wing.
To get close to Sterling in the distance, Sanne set out to push the ball in a certain direction.
The blue waters, after they have come to a glorious end, have expressed their joy by walking outside the field.
On Tuesday 1255 p.m., at Rein Nekkar Stadium in Sinshem, Germany, Hoffenem was confronted by Campienslig.
Sherzer wants to play with Speller.
There is no reason for the Nationals to start outside the game.
We have also promoted the sovereignty of our competitive partner, Sherzer, on Sundays in Colorado Cricket, but this will happen if the top rockets on the NL West Los Angeles Dodgers are out of play.
Rokis is that they have won an unexpected outcome of the National Year 5 to 2 and have maintained their primary status.
"Even though we're playing without a budget, I've been told that the height of Denver's height and the team's high level of play are not enough.
Why I Did Not Want to Compare ”
Nationals are expected to announce the beginning to the Sundays, but it is expected that the chance to become Charles Pitch will be worth it.
It is expected that it will start 34 times and that it will launch Thursdays and prepare for the next weekend.

Trump’s Support Camp in western Virginia
The president of the Supreme Court said that it would be helpful to win over a successful republican election, since the Supreme Court had elected Brit Kavan.
"All we did in November was follow you."
Five weeks have passed since the most important choice was made in our life.
This is one of the big ones. I'm not running. I'm running well.
As Trump continued, he said: "Look at this frightening group of democracys that have come out of this terrible story.
In addition, they are trying to get power, using whatever means are available. See them as useless and immoral.
"They don't care if anyone hurt them until they get in their hands. They want to take power and control."
She says: "Democracies are on mission to oppose and destroy."
"As you have seen in the past four days, he has called democracys "worshipful, worthless, ignorant, and liars"
He raised the Senate Law Committee and heard a loud voice of support from the conventioner when he was named by the name of the St. Danny Fencet.
“ Remember her answer?
Did the document come out of your hand?
What is Uh Uh
"At all, oh is never a chance to give -- that bad sign language. The worst sign language I've ever seen in my life.
In the church, there has been no rape.
People who speak in their minds are impatient.
I am amazed at the lack of recognition of many of my party assignments
To tell the truth, I'm better off with Libre MPs, but I don't like to talk about what we all think.
Parliament's house, John Ryan, had a similar experience, because it was a campaign of deliberate hostility.
Because I did not agree with the German Corbone, I have been a victim of a campaign of hate.
Other rights that have not been agreed upon with previous leaders about economic policy, national security, Europe, and Germany
"We want it to be included and produced," said Nottingham East Libr last Friday.
On Friday evening, after eight years in Libre MP, I was elected to the GCC meeting.
It may not be the sound of many meetings today in a sad way, and it has been a long time since the policy of "good people, young people" was raised, and perhaps not started again.
It is increasingly unwelcome to the unique ideas of the Liberian Party, and only if they are accepted by the party leaders.
This began after the German leadership, and I had thought in advance that I would be able to take the same political views as I was while I was with them — accepting them and supporting them, agreeing with national security or even the single market of the European Union, which I did not agree with.
When I speak to the public, what I say does not cause any problem. The media present a problem is distorted.
And this is not my experience.
Of course, I believe that I am better off than my friends, because the comments to me are of a political nature.
I personally admire the profession and my workmates who face serious daily sexual and racial attacks.
What is most upset about politics is that the level of pressure is common.
The Gabby Corbin pointed out last week that the Liberian party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that there is no larger church, and it also makes the party more weak when it changes the law of choice without any confidence.
"I am now successful, having been advised to humble myself in the past two years and not be too much of a blind person."
But I didn’t bring it into politics
I thought I could become a local councilman and a government minister to serve fully in public services when I started to have lower education overall, following the merger of Librne when I was 32 years ago.
I did not hide my political views, including the past.
No one in West Nottingham is confused by my political stand and disagrees with current leaders.
I couldn't afford to spend time and money on Bri's insurance and community services, knowing that on the basis of my loyalty to the Liberian Party, Friday would affect the country's living conditions, even worse, and people's services.
I have one message, not to stop the movement of Nothinham, but to look at the state, including the Liberian party and the other: I am proud to be able to continue serving.

Ayr 38 – 17 melleros: Ayr is gone
The two were on the move, but Ayr would certainly finish the tenets premiership contest
By not winning ten games, they are running the board as one.
Finally, the strong defense department, as well as the speakers, helped them to win the best opportunities in the field, which was followed by the joy of coach Peter Murche.
He said, "We've just been tested in many games, and we haven't won a game, and I'm happy."
“Thank you for Ayr, but they've created a better share than we do, ” says Mallrose's Robin Christy.
Grant Anderson's 14-minute experiment turned Fraser into a major leader of Ayr, but gave Scotland's Ashbel Rory Huggs a chance to take advantage of the Wariers of the Yellow Card, which enabled Melros to move better and Jason Batt's goals to be pursued.

Melros II was well started in the middle of the second half, and Patrick Anderson replaced it with a bug and widened it to only five.
Ruardy Nott was able to take the lead in Staford McDowell, under the leadership of Ayr Klimo, after his long-standing hard-won injuries, which, from the beginning, followed him out of play.

"It's our job to return."
In the 19th-century conflict of wealth, which has so far been seen in the bloodiest country of Bolivia, coastal memories of the Pacific Ocean are showing a keen interest in the Pacific Ocean, not only in Chile but also in Chile.
Bolivia October 1 of these promises were high for ten decades before it filed charges with the International Court of Justice after five years of relief.
Bolivia's diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said: "Bolivia must look back on the stress that comes with strength, unity, and freedom from stress."
A number of Bolivian screeners in the country will see the ICIJ decision, hoping that Chile will decide that the Sovereign of the Sea will be Bolivian.

According to the United States, his comments have come from the United Nations Secretary-General Kim John Un in Singapore, who has been discussing with North Korea's leader, and three months later he is about to start a fresh start on the already forgotten nuclear diplomacy.

The hat, made in Valentino, has been adorned with a very tall and creative coat.
Although other large hats, such as those of wealth and Annas, have been adorned and used as spell hats, they have not been prepared to heat their heads.
Tom Brown presented an unusual front cover for holidays.
The other front garments in various colors are more like Hannibal Lester than Houtt.

John Edward: International language skills are useful for international citizens.
Personal schools in Scotland were able to record the most significant results in 2018 because of the hard work done by individuals and groups in sports, art, music and other community-based activities.
In Scotland, where there are over 30,000 students, the schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools have tried to provide students and parents with the best possible service.
Personal schools are working with the aim of encouraging students to choose a career and a place of higher education as citizens.
As a system of instruction and practice, modern languages have become the preferred subjects in schools, including their reputation.
As Nelson Mandela says, "When you speak with a speaker, it should be according to his ability to understand.
When you speak with a speaker, let him have one of his senses."
It is worth noting that we should not be based solely on English to establish contact with people from other countries and to create faith.
In the private schools, languages that can be understood as a result of this year are the very basis of the chart.
68 per cent of the students have been tested on a foreign level, A.
Data collected from SCIS and 74 members focused on schools showed that 72 percent had recorded the highest AA results, 69 percent had studied French, and 63 percent had studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland believe that foreign languages are useful for children and young people in their future.
It is now provided as a teaching in the private school system and in other languages, such as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and hexa).
The study found that 17 percent of employees have a major language problem in order to find it difficult to fill in advertising forms, as a result of a survey conducted by the UK Labour Wall and Skills Commission.
Therefore, the fact that young people have a lot of language skills is very useful for their future career.
In a secular world, language skills are useful for most jobs.
As the person has chosen, not in relation to the field of employment, but in the second language, those who have learned the second language will reap benefits that will last for their lifetime.
People who speak many languages in order to communicate directly with foreign citizens win the race.
According to Yugoslavia, in 2013, over 4,000 young people of the United Kingdom were elected to be able to speak more than 75 percent of foreign languages to communicate with others and to speak only two percent (15 percent) of French.
It is worth spending money on teaching the current language to children.
Being able to speak many languages, especially to the developing economy, creates a meaningful further job opportunity for children.
In Scotland there is a difference between the languages of each school.
A number of schools teach the UK language in a more modern language, and others, such as Mandarin or Japan, think about the time after 2020.
Whatever your child's wishes, the chance to choose the languages that he or she would like to learn in private schools will also be shared by experts who have made up the same spectrum.
Scotland's private schools are determined to prepare children for future success and to create a learning environment that will enable them to be able to do so.
In the global Bisnes area, language is very useful for the future of countries, so it should not be overlooked that language should be included in education at this time.
Indeed, modern languages should pay attention to "international communication skills".
Personal schools continue to present young Scottishs in election form.
The best son no fair.
John Edward is the director of the courts of the Scottish private schools.

Rider 2018: The Tim American Cup of Mouths is held on Sunday in order to give a life of hope for play
It seems that after a three-sided race, the competition between four people after Saturday seems to have been part of the need to be included in the Rider Cup.
It is the product of a full - game sports drama, which is the product of a single-time sport game.
So when is it that they say it is now?
"They've been leading on six points, and now they're at four, so I think we're just taking it a little higher," he was slowly moving forward.
Europe is better off, and I have left the game that I made for it.
According to the American, Spain has a very small share, although they have a greater chance of being strengthened, especially from those who play together throughout the day, such as Spain and Justin Thomas, each of whom has a four-thirds point.
Spys is a murderer, and he is leading from T. to Green.
As the end of Su is increasing, these noises of joy and cry are increasing, with critical and effective hits, to get out of the fourth match, and he and Thomas are two lower and lower after the second.
His attempt to win the 15th poem is equally impressed by the shout, which convinces the American team that it is not out of competition.

This is the main thing that each speaker ignores.
18 Crossword Puzzle
In the past two years, Francisco Molinary and Tommy Flywood, the only point more than Spain and Thomas, have been the story of the Rider Cup.
But a popular European mystery is a four out of four.
On Saturday afternoon, "Molwood" was the only couple who could not get into a single pit, and on Saturday morning they were not able to set any goals.

Buba Watson and Web Simpson did a little work on Sergio Garcia, one of the morning's pairs, and then they joined Alex Norne.
The Spanish and Swedish have set up one of the pits in front of him, putting together what they have never seen before, and setting before two goals.
On Sunday no one can help, but get out of your pit yourself.
It's great to see two-and-four-time games more closely and see how their consequences change when they consult, consult, consult, and take a moment.
Europe is still better off as a team, and she has become the leading leader of the final day, but as the four-four game showed, Tim America, although she had doubts about the stateside, is interested in playing.
By results 10-6, Europe led to the completion of the Rider Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage over the completion of the Rider Cup, which will be by reviving a two-and-a-four match on Saturday's 10-6th to lead the United States.

By means of Europeans, Thomas Byjourn, they were able to take advantage of America’s two-year-old football match, which was in the morning when two-year-old Hezhelstein was shot out of the air.

North Korea says that it will never be released without faith
North Korea's Foreign Minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing conflict with the United States was deepening its mistrust with the United States, and therefore there was no way for the Nukullar military to dissociate itself from its weapons.
According to Yong He, the General Assembly of the World Foundation has taken a positive step towards the development of North Korea, for example, the cessation of an experiment with Nukli and Misael and the breaking down of the testing site, and the promise of nuclear non-proliferation.
"But we haven't found a suitable response from the United States," he said.
"We can't trust our national security without any belief in America, and we can't even afford to free ourselves of this kind."
When Rim filed the same common North Korean complaint, which he said would be an ongoing ban on nuclear weapons and therefore a rejection of the right reward for North Korea, it made it seem necessary that Pyongyang would not abandon her recent independent nuclear holocaust program.
R. at Kim John U U and Trump, who reviewed a joint statement, said that for the first time in Singapore, the U.S. President and North Korean leader held a meeting in Singapore, when Kim promised to free the Korean script from the nuclear era, while the Trump provided security for North Korea.
North Korea wants an official end to war in 1950-53, but the United States must put its nuclear strategy ahead of its own.
Washington also objected to the call for a review of the ban on North Korea.
"America first demands "the destruction of the nuclear weapons" and uses pressure to force them to enter here, says Rie.
"To try to subvert us by trying to do so is an impossible dream and a deaf people who don't know us.
The problem is that the continued lack of confidence is deep among us.
For the second time, Ri has not mentioned anything about the United States leader because of the fact that there is a Trump and Conference between Kim and Kim.
The Ministry, in particular, took up three meetings between Kim and Mun Jin in South Korea over the past five months, adding: "It would not have been difficult to free the Korean tongue from the nuclear threat of nuclear destruction, rather than from South Korea. "
Although Ri's voice is very different from that of the past, it was after the General Assembly, speaking to the United States, said "My Rocket Man" Trump Kim, the ultimate North Korean Rocket.
Trump said that, just as he had not threatened North Korea with "complete destruction " last night, he was impressed by the action being taken to resolve the fighting, but he said that a number of jobs would still be organized and that North Korea should continue to maintain its nuclear disarmament.
"If it takes two years, if it takes three months or five months, it won't be a problem."
China and Russia are at odds with the United Nations: the Security Council should be able to complete the Pyongyang process.
But according to Secretary-General Mike Pompey of the Security Council of the United Nations, the Security Council has to continue and continue on Thursday: "The retention of the Security Council must continue until the outcome of the operation of the nuclear disarmament process is achieved."
Since 2006, the Security Council has allowed North Korea to terminate financial support for Pyongyang's Niculler and Balsiel's balsic subsidies to be given to Pyongyang.
Pompio met with Rein, who is a member of the European Union. According to the General Assembly, in the following month, they were again visiting Pinning to prepare the second discussion.
Pompio Semen visited Korea for the third time this year alone, but the third visit did not produce as much results as expected.
When Julie Pioning was released during the month, it was stated that they were organizing their changes in different hours of time.
This month, North Korea, at their meeting with Moon, stated that America should take a "corresponding action" to break down its missile stations and the aggression of Niculler.
According to Kim, "a similar action" they want to guarantee their safety, and Trump said that they promised in Singapore to increase their relationship with Washington to a better level.
Harvard students learned about getting sufficient rest.
This year, it was reported that all Ander-Greuette students at Harvard University were trained to stop studying with the help of 'the night with a lot of caffeine'.
The world’s largest number of students is said to be a university, low awareness of basics and how to see themselves.
Charles Essler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and specialist at Birmingham and Women's Hospital, and at the Women's Hospital, held a course that he believed was unique in America.
The lack of sleep has been motivated to start training on the impact of education.
'In the end, a woman came to me and said, 'Why is it now that I have been told about it? Why wasn't it told me in the past years?'
When she said that she would never miss telling her about the benefits of bed, Aass said that he was surprised.
The first course, which began this afternoon, shows that good sleep helps students to better implement their educational and athletic skills and to protect their health in general.
Paul Barrera, professor of medicine at Harvard School of Health and head of the University Health Service, said he decided to introduce the course within the week if he wanted and found students with severe sleep disorders.
Timely training involves many participatory actions.
In one section, students' home — with coffee teeth, curtains, coaches, caffeine and silver influences, and a lack of sleep — are about to be observed for regular hours of sleep.
In another part, participants are told that prolonged sleeplessness increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, stress and cancer.
The participants in the training are encouraged to think about their skills in a way that is published in the entry map.
'We know that student behavior doesn't change right away.
We believe that they have the right to know, and just as you have the right to know about the health impact that smoking has on your health.
There is still a culture of pride in the night without sleep: the use of modern technology, according to him, and a growing lack of sleep following pressure on students.
Be assured that you will have a good night's rest: this is a secret tool of students to stop anxiety, fatigue and insecurity and, according to him, to reduce weight, make sleep deprivation feel a constant hunger for us.
The 19-year-old californ studies chemical and physical biology, and he assisted Professor Seissler, who recorded the course. Last year he attended a class one day at Harvard University.
He explained that he had made the course public and had encouraged him to take other courses in the building.
Next, he hoped that all police students would have to follow the same programs and tell them that they should complete their courses before going to competition institutions.
Professor Chesler advises that students should go to bed, use a mattress to get up, and know that there is damage to blue lights released from electronic screens and LEDs, which also distorts the heart rate and makes it difficult for us to sleep.

The Minga goal in Allanmakgrass must be followed by Scott Pittman outside the race and set a goal in two minutes, but he can expand his chances.
When Keghan Jacob reached the point where he was severely punished, Craig Helket, his protective friend Allen consulted the target.
Ringers were good at keeping the ball under control, and they have more hope than they have for playing a third game.
In the first quarter, Alfredo Morlos had been in a fight with Steven Lowells, but Judge Steven Thompson ignored the Colombians' question.
In the first half of, the Rangers tried two games, and at Ove Ijaria, the former keeper of the Abrox goal, Liam Kelly, was disturbed by the shocking attempts of Lassa and Colombian frontballs.
The beginning of the 34-minute Lyvie game is opposite: nobody denies it as it should be.
Ringers are again unable to talk to Jacob.
Scott Arfield, like Declan Gallagher, gave her ball to Scott Robinson, who was able to make menga great red.
[ 1] Gerard was able to create an impact on the rest of Rain Kent instead of Collibaline, and as Marilos, who plays on this wing, quickly closed the gap and created a stronger impact on Kelly.
But to play a game of pleasure to the guest group, Living Stones must be given a shot and a long hardball.
Through Holtz, while strengthening their leadership in the final rounds, he tried to stop Makrjer Jacob before the attack began.
Glyne Middleton, who was replaced by Ringers, asked for a severe sentence to be fined for following his arrest in Jacob, but Thomson ignored it.

In a gentle manner, however, a 31-year-old actress has made my brother-in-law Sikon think that such a minority should be very strong in honoring young boys.
Speaking to the Sunday Times culture, there is something wrong, and it requires how we should fight when it strikes this deadly racist attitude.
Keith, recently married to Rose Leslin, 31 years old, who is an assistant to Gem of Sharon, says, "I think it's very important."
'Do I personally have strong feelings about masculinity now?' he said.
‘ What were we teaching men when we raised them in view of the problems we now see? ’
TV, especially with regard to maleism, takes on the highest priority, thanks to its male characters.
And he continued, and said, Which are natural, and which are also?
What makes the young man feel that he is a man?
This is the greatest question of our time — how do we change our situation?
And the consequences are something about our youth that is on the wrong path.
In his interview, he reportedly announced that the next summer, when his followers were finished, there was no pre-recorded or poor narratives in order to announce the cessation of 'war zones and horses'.
From the next November, Keith's re-engineered Sam Shepherds, Tru West, a brother who has been a robber of a film, has been a leader in the post.
Recently, the actor said that he wanted to meet his wife, Rose, and said that he thought she was the best from Gem of Sharon.
'I found my wife on this scene, so he gave me my future wife, and my life will be there from now on.'
Kitt's character John Shaw, in his romantic interest, played the role of Rose Ygrity on a series of fair Amys.
The two were married in June 2018 at the Leisley Family Park in Scotland.
HVI/AIDS has announced a 14% increase in newly caught China
China announced that its citizens living with HVI and AIDS had reached 14%.
More than 820,000 victims are reported by health officials.
In 2018 the second quarter is reported to have taken 40,000 new seizures.
Most of them were newly caught in the relationship of Egypt, and they have changed since the last few years.
So far, in some parts of China, HIV has been passed on contaminated blood by means of health care.
But according to China’s health director in the state of June, the number of HVI cases has been reduced to almost zero.
In China, however, the number of people living with HIV is growing at 100,000.
The violation of HVI in Egypt is a major issue in the Chinese Elgibiti community.
It has been said that according to China’s law, inter-wetting is increasingly a crime in 1997 when Soshan Elgibitin was declared to be a crime.
Studies suggest that 70-90% of men who have committed sex in the country may eventually marry a woman.
Most of the EVI distribution is not sufficiently careful about these findings.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to implement HIV/AIDS as a country-wide solution to this problem.
Maxy Waters denied the machine of Gop Center Data and the explosion of 'dangerous lies' and 'Serahassy theory'
America, like myself, has denied that a workmate, on Saturdays, has posted the personal information of the three American Senators on the front page of Parliament Wikipedia.
As Lousangele's democracy has praised, she has been wearing the "Operational Wings" and is playing on the Internet.
"False lies and many shameful lies," what Water put on Twitter's page.
The information released included the address of the American home and telephone address: Sinter of South Carolina, Lindsey Garham, Mike Lee and Orin Hach, both of the Otah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday by an unknown man, Catitol Hill, who was currently in the city of Saint-Panal, elected by the Supreme Court.
It happened only after the three senators asked Kavanuk questions.
Traditional Web sites have been linked to the Waters Office, and have been released from the Waters Bureau of Information, according to The Hill, as reported by the Gate Way and Red State.
"This baseless accusation is a complete lie, Waters," has been abandoned.
"My workmate's identity, personal information and safety have been affected by this false and fraudulent accusation, and he has never been held responsible for this.
That's a lie.
The Waters statement was quickly criticized, including by the former White House Secretary-General Ari Flyscher.
"This denial is anger," Fletcher wrote.
"This shows that she does not have the patience to become a member of Congress.
A person should not be upset when he is charged with an unworked job.
They should not be disobedient.
They should not ask what the man's wishes are.
They must be calm and peaceful.
Fletcher tries to compare the situation of Walters with that of Judge Kavanuk, who was accused of being very angry at the Thursday conference.
In the middle of the election, Omar Navarro, who raced to pick up Waters from her seat, announced his vote on Twitter.
"If it's the truth, it's the truth."
In her description, Waters stated that her office had replaced this fraudulent accusation "with the right authorities and law enforcement bodies.
"We confirm that they are exposed," he continued, "and to any member of our forces and to all their destructive and dangerous actions, they will be held legally responsible."
Johnny England Street — An Incompetent Smurf of Rwan Atkinson
Now it is common to see the importance of a bid in a new film, and the advice of a John England action by British view and by John Shoe, was first introduced in 2003 by Johnny Shaw, England, and was born in John and England in 2011.
Will Tang in Czech make us feel as if the country’s new export business were being turned into a garbage dump?
In any case, Pap Id, Goma's face is the second-time renewal of John England's so-called "Ya-Sumum" is most visible to uncontested cinemat areas.
Yes, he is a useless spy, but he has approached Closey in a bit of confusion, but Mr. Bean's spirit and his masculinity contribute a little to the charters of Fair's 2012 theme at the start of the London Olympics.
Atkinson, a secret person who was first built on a TV ad that was now forgotten, was playing on the now forgotten Barklycard, and started a lot of controversy before it started.
There will be one or two good times on this new visit to the GII.
I liked Johnny England when he approached the helicopter in a wheelchair with a portable knife on top of the coat of mail and head until the middle of the day.
Atkinson is visiting the funny gift of the body, but his sadness, especially in the case of 007 and the Mitch impossibly, goes beyond comedy to comedy's goal and is extremely low and in a painful fashion.
The recreational benefit seems to be not just for adults but for children, but for Johnie England's confusion, as we have seen in Person and Ben's silent Atkinson's movie of wild animals.
The current topic is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyberbreaker broke English spies' ties into a very tight web and exposed British spies in the field to the fact that he worked on the job and that he had a small role to play, namely, Kevin Eldon.
She did all she could in this fake Teresa May character, but nothing worked in the playbook.
As her Internet counselor said, each surveillance operation has been damaged, so she must bring in a retired person.
John England himself, who is confused, says that he is now the director of a rich school, but he has a school of surveillance as a rock house here in England.
England was re-located to Whitehol for an urgent announcement, where Ben Miller was able to re-unite with his former and most troubled assistant Boh.
Boh is now married, and a seafarer has stuck to a sailor, and if he does not play a pretty and good-looking role, he will lose Vicky Pepedin.
So Batman and Robin have taken over all of the queen's strict surveillance work, and the matter of getting rid of it has been settled by the beautiful Fém Fatale Ophele O'Fele Bultovan.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger of falling into the hands of a wicked tech billionaire and is hoping to solve British computer problems, as seen by rich Jason Lassie, where he plays Volta.
England and Boh began their journey in the warmest season: They took the home of a French restaurant as a host and set themselves on board the Volta's luxury ship, creating a problem of escape; England's vorchial relicity attempted to introduce himself to the inside of the Volta House, creating a quick riot.
All last series stops have certainly been launched, but because of the popularity and warmth of the last series, the overall situation is like a small child's television.
My beauty is not exaggerated.
And can’t I stop thinking about John England’s other films and bring justice to the British film industry by playing the right role in its talent?
Lebour denied that he was working on a five-day plan to start four days a week but that he was working on it.
The German Corbian Lambert Party stated that it was planning to set up an English four-day weekly plan, but that payment would be about five days.
It is said that the party wants the company’s executives to spend an additional day on workers ’ vacation, giving them time savings obtained through the Mortgage of Artificial Intelligence (IA).
He sees employees take three days off, but takes a single fee home to make sure he is satisfied.
They stated that the idea was in line with the economic agenda of the Party and that it planned to take advantage of the country’s workers.
The trade union has been approved by the trade union to hold up to four days to help employees to benefit from the changed economy.
The source of the long-term Liberian party reported to the Sunday Times is expected to be released before the end of the year.
"Not once, but the economics of the four-day work week is a success hoped for by the party to restore balance in a way that supports employees and the general industrial plan of the party."
In view of the commitment made in 2017 during the four-day work week of the Green Party, it is not the first time that the Liberian Party has publicly presented this comment.
But what is expected to succeed is not going on at this present time in the form of a full Liber Party.
"The four-day work week is not a party policy, nor is it being taken into account by the party. "
Shado chanceller John McDonald used the Leber meeting last week to explain the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald claimed that if there were any "unnamed business executives" and "farmers" in the community, they would take over the authority of the "unnamed executives" and "farmers".
The Chado Council’s plans also mean that the current stockholders of water companies may not be able to get their full share back because the Liberian government can make it "reducing" because of the illegal act of the Liberian government.
In addition to a 10 per cent stock exchange for employees and private companies, the figure for employees in the company's stock exchange has confirmed plans for the acquisition of an inclusive portfolio of property assets for employees up to 500 per year.
Lidsley Graham, John Kennedy F.
Justice Bret Kavanah asks that the FBI's examination of the charges against the Supreme Court has delayed its last vote at least one week, and the Bureau's findings may allow any of the republican mayors to join in their support.
On Sunday's interview, the "60 Minutes" news representative Scott Pelley asked the republican senators if they could find anything that could change the minds of John Kennedy and Lindsley Graham.
Kennedy seemed clearer than his South Carolinan friend.
"I can't, I can't, I can't."
"I thought I was going to go and hear the testimony, and I thought I had spoken with Judge Kavanah."
After this happened, he had been called, and that charge had appeared, and he said, 'You've done it?'
He was firm, decisive, and unassuming in his decision.
However, it seems very difficult or impossible to change the voice of Graham.
I want to tell you about Cavannah, and I have decided to accept a charge that could lead to trouble.
"Dr. Ford doesn't know what happened, but I do know this: Bret strongly denied, Christine Blacksey Ford added Graham.
And he could not confirm any man whom thou callest by name.
36 is dead.
Nothing shall appear to me that is changing.
What has Global Citizen Festival done to reduce poverty?
Now, on Saturday in New York, she prepares the Global City Festival, which has the task of producing a huge musical collection of stars and a mission to end poverty.
Tens of thousands of people are now gathered at the seventh-century Global Citizen Festival Park Great Loun, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B.
The Global City Festival, which was launched in 2012, is a penal group of non-compromising activists who believe that it can increase the number of people who are active in fighting poverty and stop poverty.
If you are not allowed to pay the Viepi ticket, the concert participants had to complete a series of small jobs or "actions" as a service of charity, e-mails, telephone calls or other meaningful goals that would help them stop poverty.
But how well does the Global Citizen accomplish its goal by 12 years?
Is it the right way to convince people that they want to view the scenes free of charge, or is it the “clicktivism ” because they think that people have made a real difference by making a complaint on the internet or a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen reports that it has registered more than 19 million "participants" from its supporters, moving it to set various goals.
He says that these actions have moved the world’s leaders to concern themselves with determination and to form more than $37 billion in policies that, by 2030, could affect more than 2.25 billion people’s lives.
In early 2018, the group referred to 390 work-related processes and decrees, and at least $10 billion was paid or collected.
The group estimates that as many as 649 million people in the world are affected.
Among the main extracts, the alimony of food, the U.K., was promised to help "help children develop their full skills" of $4,700 tweets from all the citizens of the world to help eliminate malnutrition in Rwanda.
"From the UK government, donors, national governments, and the support of citizens like you, we will make a history of social injustice, "at the London live show of Power of Nutrition, Budget Projection and Allman in April 2018.
U.K. has announced that the government is financially supportive of the more than 5000 actions undertaken to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government's more than 5 million mothers and children's mothers and children, the Power of Nutrition project.
In response, an FAQ website asks: "What are you worried about to eliminate extreme poverty?"
The answer of the citizens of the world is, "It will be a long and difficult road. Sometimes we go down and fall.
But, like the great human rights and anti- apartheid activities before us, we succeed, because we are more powerful than the top.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd,S here are Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe at Deborra-Lee Florence and Hugh Jackman in New York this year.
The sale of Russian energy abroad can use its natural energy
Washington "If necessary", Russian power markets, including the Middle East, could be turned to the U.S. internal spokesman Ryan Zinke, as stated, Washington Examiner.
Zinke has made it clear that Russeian's intervention in Syria is working especially with the government. This is an excuse for a new energy market.
“ I believe that the reason why they entered the Middle East is that they were going to run for Heil, ” he reports, “just as they did in Eastern Europe, in the southern European stomach.
And, in the opinion of the authorities, there are ways and means to cope.
"The United States has the capacity to verify, and if necessary, to shut down, and prevent the supply of energy from entering the market through our natural energy."
Zinke was making his self known to the conventioners in what he called the "Voice of the Power Users" Association in the US.
Washington has gone out to compare her business offer with that of Rosaya and Iran, and as a result, it considers us to be as effective as we are.
"Iran and Russia's option of fortune-richness, whether it's too much, forced and fuel replacement," he said, "one of the most qualified", when the Rossian power of wealth claimed to be dependent solely on fossil fuel.
The statement came from the fact that the Trump administration replaced Russia and increased the cheapest option for European users, the sending of natural gas.
As a result, the Trump management authorities, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to launch a “undeserved” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, and in view of the Trump, Berlin makes it a “captive”.
As Moscow has repeatedly announced, the capacity of 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipelines to pass through the current line is twice as high as 70 feet [110 m].
Kremlin argued that Kremlin’s strong disagreement over Washington’s project is a simple argument for financial reasons and for e-justice competition.
“ I believe that power cannot be a means of providing support and that we share the view that opposers should choose suppliers, ” said Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak from the U.S. spokesman Rick Perry in September, a meeting held in Moscow.
US's comments met with strong opposition from Germany, and reiterated its determination to the project.
The German Industry Federation, (BDI), the German Institute of Engineering, has called for its withdrawal from the EU Energy Policy and its two-way agreement in Berlin and Moscow.
At a recent meeting of the Government of Germany, Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), Dieter Kempf, said: "I have a big problem when the third country intervenes in our power, "
To compete for President, Elizabeth Warren said in 2020 that she would take a "association sign"
Elyzabethe Warren, a member of the Council of Laws of Massachusetts, said on Saturday that she would take a "association" from the young man's choice to compete for president.
In Holyoke, Masachussets' conference hall, I have thought about comparing.
According to The Hill Report, "Women are going to Washington to fix our broken government, and that adds to the above women," she said.
"From October 26 I will fully consider running for President."
"The country is heading in the wrong direction, "Warren chose President Donald Trump at the meeting hall.
"Donald Trump said, "I am afraid of what is working for our democracy," she said.
Warren, on her back, expressed her feelings about Trump and his high court, and his candidate Bert Kavanaugh.
On Friday, at the Web site, Warren said, "We want FBI investigators right before we pick."
Thursday's census showed, however, that most of Warren's own voters felt that it was no match for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent said that the members of the Council of Laws, such as the "possible" , were not to be compared, such as the Political Research Centre/Boston Globe of the University of Suffolk.
Thirty-two hundred have supported such a contest.
The poll showed great support for former Governor Deval Patrick's competition, 38 per cent supported competition, and 48 per cent opposed.
Another high-ranking democracy, former vice-president Joe Biden and Vermont Council member Bernie Sanders, explained around.
Biden said he would decide publicly, reported Associated Press.

El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, with a large number of U.S. asylum-seekers supporting them, have described them as having continued problems.
The new U.S. security policy has taken over the 2014 Bordeaux of Imigraint Apples's decision to allow unregistered refugees to flee domestic attacks to serve as shelter.
The new policy is "to ignore the state-of-the-state, federal and non-community laws" as stated by the Attorney General of Colombia, Carl Resin Friday.
"Federal law wants all security questions to be judged on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates that rule," stated the prosecutor in the court of law.
In addition, the lawyers argued that the policy prohibiting the entry of refugees is the greatest chance of becoming business-makers, as is the cost to the economy of the USS, and that “they provide the necessary energy”.
Supreme Attorney-General Jeff Siesans ordered that judges in refugee cases not seek refuge in domestic brutality and organized criminal group attacks.

The USS ambassador charges China with Propoganda ads with "threat".
In China, Ambassador Beijing accused the American printing press of using propaganda to broadcast an official Chinese newspaper published daily by the USA.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who denied China, claims to interfere with the choice of Congress in Nov.6 U.S.A., and then raises a case in which the newspaper De Money Register, which is widely sold in the state of Iowa, was divided into Chinese Daily.
The Trump case that Beijing was trying to interfere with U.S. elections marked a new stage of the ever-increasing pressure campaign of Washington, China, reported by U.S. authorities.
While advertising is common in foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are now involved in a relentless commercial war that has led them to throw all their goods at one another.
Specialists of China and the USA said that Chinese trade unions were designed to harm their supporters in states such as Ioa.
In China, the former U.S. ambassador for agriculture and agriculture has said that it has affected American workers, farmers and businesses, as well as the long-standing president of Ioua, who is sending to China’s main export.
"China is now doubling its threat by printing propaganda ads on its own free prints," wrote Branstad in Sundays de Money Regis.
"In order to spread propaganda, the Chinese government is using the free speech and the culture of free publications held in America to make payment advertisements on De Mone Register. "
“ On the other hand, ” he wrote, “you see no real reflection of the various attitudes that China’s people have regarding the various economic conditions in China, considering that the media is under strict control by the Communist Party of China. ”
"One of China's best-known newspapers refused to sign the letter," he added, but he did not say which one of China's most famous newspapers was.
Republicans warn that before the mid - term of office of the female electors, they are isolated because of the fall of Kavanah
Although many large republics have raised questions about the abuse of sex by the Attorney-General of the law, Bret Kavanakh, they have been warned by commentators that, in the mid-point of their choice, they will face a negative response, especially from women.
The feelings associated with this are very strong, and most republicans show a clear desire to move forward with the voice.
Grant Riecher, professor of political science at the University of Syracuse Maxwell School, wrote to The Hill, published on Saturday.
Richard Jeff Flick (Ar-Erizona) is suspected of having sufficient final-minute FBI testing to alert depressed voters.
"Women won't forget what happened last night, and they won't forget it tomorrow, in November," said a national adviser and spokesman for Karin Jean Pierre Friday, such as Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, as the opponents fought peacefully on the way to the entrance of the Santo Hall, shouting, "Novimber is here!"
“ The deep will and motivation of democracy will disappear from the record board, ” said political analyst St. Rosenberg to the News Watch, who is not a member of any political party.
"Men are lifted up in the beginning, and that is the truth.
But especially when the president is not loved, he may be raised among the town’s mostly silent women’s electors and between 18 and 29-year-olds. ”
Ford had pointed out that a strong negative reaction from commentators who had continued to justify Republicans by justifying their charges of sexual assault on the general prosecutor, who had given Ford a list of cases of sexual assault before the public.
Michael Steele, chairman of the former National Republican Committee, reported in early last week that “this has become a problem for the Gyopian population. ”
"Not only about the sound of the committee, the final voice, or the sitting of the Kavanah, but also about the way the republics take this and host her," said Guy Cecil, director of the Priority USA team, pointing out to the news station.
However, after Ford and Kavanah testimony, Americans seem to be divided into two parts, at least to the whole.
New yogov voice polling shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in Ford in what is said to be sure or to be true, and 35 percent believe in Kavanakhs in what is said to be sure or to be certain.
In addition, 38 percent of Kavanakhs believe that he lied when giving testimony in the form of a certain or supposed testimony, and only 30 percent say that he lied.
After Flick’s pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramírez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified to the fact that she had been drunk with her 17-year-old Kavanah when she witnessed under oath before the Senate Committee.
Ramírez, the Attorney General, is accused of exposing his members to Yale when they attended a party during the 1980s.
The Creator of the system plans to start a new web site to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Barnes-li Facebook, Amazon, and Google are starting a new business.
The technologically rich project, Inrapt, the Burns-Lin, is a growing company on the Solid platform, whose source is open.
Solid users can choose where to store their information and which information to use.
In his interview with Fascist Canpani alone, Barnes-Lei joked that his desire for the back of the Enrapt was "the top of the world".
He said, "We have to start now," about the new business.
"It's a historic moment."
It allows people to use their own “personal internet information store” or “pod” using solid technology.
Details of reputation, lists of things to do, daily censuses, music museums, and other personal and professional instruments.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spontify all in one pot and at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal web browser is the choice of the full user to use whatever information is available.
The company calls it "the self-governance of power through the aid. "
In the company's main executive, John Bruce is based on the Internet, helping to make Soyed accessible to everyone by bringing property, process, and proper knowledge.
Currently, the company has staffed the Berners-Lynne, Bruce, security network from the ABM, with a contract wall for workers and good-willed software developers to sign the project.
Since this week, technological advancements around the globe can use the tools on the Internet to create separate platforms from the center.
Burners-li said that he and the group did not say that they should introduce the changes to complete their business with the Fascist Book and Google at the same time.
"We don't ask their permission."
On Saturday's writing, Barner's-Le wrote: “The mission of the Enraptus is to provide commercial and institutional strength to protect the new due diligence and quality that will be built on Solid. ”
In 1994, Berners-Lei set up the International Telecommunication Union in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Burners-Ley has been the voice of the Creator, who has been influenced by the online debate of discrimination.
As the Inrapt is starting, Berners-li will continue to be the founder and chief executive of the International Writ Association, the Internet Foundation and Opta Data Institute.
"For the most wonderful things I am, for the next time of the world." Berners-li added.
Bernard Van: Dignified by the priest of 1 Victoria Cross
In the war of the first world war, the priest of Church of Egeland was granted 100 years of dignity in the city of residence, with the discovery of Victoria's Cross.
The award was awarded on 29 September 1918 by Belenge and Leóncourt Le/Co Bernd Van.
However, he never knew that after four days he won the great battle of England by being shot in the nail.
A gem was found on Saturday by Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of his sons.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said that the stone was “excellently exemplary” over 100 years of experience from his grandfather's prize.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Le/Ku Van led his military commander in Canal de Saint-Quentin, "a very dense and heavy field machine gun" in the Canal de Saint-Quentin.
He went to the field fire on his own, hit the three sections, and rushed to the "great hero" line, and headed forward
Le/co Van was shot in German on September 24, 1911, a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, his grandfather's work was "what I know I can never have"
In addition, he and his brother, Dr. James Van, have set up a flowering trunk in charge of the military conflict led by the United Young People's Fund.
Michael Van said that he felt so honored that "the military is a body in battle" and added that "a real hero and hero are being shown support by many people.
MMA supporters have been awake all night to see Bellator 206, and they have found Peppa pigs instead
Think of this, and they have been awake for a full night to see Bellator 206 in union.
San José got me with 13 games, six in the main card, and the evening at the UK Channel 5 was seen directly.
On 6am, just as Gerard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in UK were surprised when the distribution was transferred to Peppa pigs.
Some were not happy with the play, especially if they kept on the watch until sunrise.
The conversion of a supporter into a child's cartoon by Twitter has been described as "little fun."
"At 6 a.m., that content is inappropriate and must be converted into a child program," says Dave Schwartz, Bellator Marking and a vice president, when asked about the distribution.
"Peppa the pig," Abette.
The president of the Bellator Foundation, Scott Coker, said that they were going to work on their program to include UKK viewers.
"When I think about the answer game, I think maybe we can make it right.
"But this Sunday is six o'clock in the morning, and we can't adjust it until Sunday at our time, on Mondays.
But we are working in it.
I'm sorry, when he was copied, many books went here and here, and not all of them were friends.
We were trying to fix it, and we thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't, it was a matter of government.
A continuing time shall not be repeated, that I may make a promise to thee.
We have reduced it to more than six games, and we have tried and gone to a thousand times as much as we do--and we have tried to make a lot of supporters.

Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "subjection" about sex
Tom Daley, the Olympic champion, said that he had grown up feeling inferior to all because of his sex -- he encouraged him to succeed.
He said that he did not understand until 24-year-old "all like him" went to high school.
In the first 4 Desert Island Discs Radiosl, speaking of homosexual rights gives “hope ” to others
He added that being a parent made him feel less concerned about winning the Olympics.
A long racer, Kirsty Young, has been granted permission for months because of illness.
In Laverne, the first program was launched under the supervision of Daley, who said that he felt "low" from all young people because "the love of men and women had no social parallel."
He said: “For today, feelings of inferiority, and speciality were real things that gave me the strength and strength to be victorious.”
He wants to prove that he was a "thing", so he doesn't upset everyone when they learn about his sex.
The Olympic diamond medalist, who has the highest reputation for LGBT, uses his face to make it more difficult to view homosexuality as a crime in the Australian Commonwealth games.
He spoke out because he openly said that he wanted to give "hope" to others because he felt the advantage of being able to live without--
The third-time World Champistronist, who met a man in 2013, said, "I'm impressed by the fall in love, because of the US film "Dustin Lance Black", which he discovered in 2013.
Dally, last year, he married his 20-year-old Oscar winner, but never became an issuer of age.
He said: “It was hard to find someone of the same age who had gone to the first Olympic in this youth” - who had died of cancer at the age of 14 and whose father had died of cancer since the age of three.
In May, the two were parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black, who said that the "Dally" and "Dally the whole face" had been changed.
"If you had asked me over the past year, I'd only want a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
The Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
As his father, Robert, died of brain cancer in 2011, his son has a similar name.
Dally refused to accept the death of his father, and said that one of his last requests was that he had their ticket for London 2012 because he wanted to be in front of him.
He said, "I can't tell you that my father won't be with us in front of us."
"He was holding his hand when the breath stopped, and I realized that he would not be able to stop breathing until he died," he said.
The next day, Daley won the 2010 Olympic Games for copper.
"But I know that if this was my age, I will be able to say, "In front of the supportive people, I will be caught up in Olympic games, and there will be no feeling of failure," he said.
He triggered his first music selection -- Proud, which he had been introducing with him in the Heather Small-Olympic arrangement, and is now the subject of a rarity.

Mickelson, who took his stand, changed into a Rider Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mikkelson puts honor into his 47-time Ryder Cup, but he has to change his position so as not to put things that are unpleasant.
Mickelson, who was playing the two-yearly double-playing match for the 12th time, was replaced by Jim Furyk in a four-time match on Saturday.
Rather than being the strongest of the actions, as was the case with the United States, the winner of the five times divided his time by supporting and preparing for the game in order to relieve the stress.
Not even those who travel to escape will ever come from the tower he has reached in his game age, but the 48-year-old playwright will not be suitable for the difficult national game field of Le Golf, who is a great and unreformable man.
And if the field isn't enough to give up on its own, Mikkelson will join the ninth Sunday game this week with Rockie Tommy Flietwood, who created a strong bond of British Open to win the four games.
By 4 points, the Americans, who had started the 12 separate games, would be able to testify to the importance of Mikkelson’s play unless they started a major attack.
Furyk expressed his confidence in himself, and he did not tell much more.
"He is fully aware of his role now, and if he hits my back and puts his arm on me, he will be ready tomorrow, ” said Furyk.
"He has deep faith in himself.
He's amazing, he's increased a lot in the past group, and this week I'm threatening him.
I didn't think that he would add two games as an opportunity.
I thought a lot about it, but that's what we thought, and we thought we should go a lot.
Like all of them, he wants to be this."
On the subject of many Ryder games, Mickelson passed away the honours of Nick Faldon's Sunday game.
Since we never deserve to lose his personal dignity, Ryder's ball game can show the end of his time.
Mickelson has won 18 times, 20 times he won 7 times, but he has brought unto the group things that cannot be seen.
"He's funny, he's a taunter, a joker, he makes fun of people, and finding him in the group is great."
"The young players are having an emotional conversation with him this week, and they're sorry to see it.
"He gives more than much talk."
Europe’s umbrella Thomas Bjorn knows that leading a wide variety of different ways will soon be lost
As Europe's amble Thomas Bjorn has learned from practice, when it arrives at the end of the day, it can turn into a journey that is not easy to enjoy.
This first game was held for Valderrama in 1997, at the time in the Ambo Seve Ballesteros on the Americans, although the top of the five-point band was on the Americans, it finally won the game with a little result, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"Remember yourself that we were leading your head on Valderrama, and if we were to win, we would've run on the Rockline, and we won on the young Valderrama," says Bjorn, after winning the 2018 graduates 5-3 Friday and yesterday, when he was leading the National Le Golf, after seeing him by his own thought.
Therefore the history shows me and all the members of the group that this thing is not finished.
Tomorrow thou shalt put forth thy full strength.
Go up here, and do all that is right.
It didn't end until you found the number on the tablet.
It's about Alamal, trying to win the ball, and this is where he's focused.
I have spoken all of them together - I focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know very well that there are great players in the world on this side."
Bjorn added: "I could never have done anything to help myself with this.
Let another not have mercy on the next day.
Tomorrow is an individual's qualification, and that's a different thing to do.
When things go well, there's a lot to be with, but when you're alone, it's like a golf player.
You must take that message to all players, and you must be the best one tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner alone, let him go, let him show his best qualified."
Apart from Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas, who have three points in common, partner Jim Furyk expects the players to show him individualized qualifications rather than those they have worked together.
Furyk himself was on both sides of this major change, and before he won, when Europe finally lifted the "Medinah Miracle" in Brooklyn, it was the body of the winner’s team.
I remember every word, he said, "How did Ben Crenshaw respond in 1999 to the question of how to gather the players who are moving towards the end of the day?"
"Tomorrow, we have 12 key games, but as you saw on the Brookline, it's better to get rid of that quick start, as you saw Medinah.
As we get the sense of it one way, pressure is placed solely on accompaniment.
We've set up our path on a much larger basis, and we've put the people in the way we've heard them, you know, and tomorrow we're trying to create magic."
Thomas, who was given to try to lead the response, and Rory McLroy, met other Europeans in the top, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Flietwood and Ian Poulter, in the same order.
"I went in this order with this group's grammar because I thought it would cover up to the inside," Bjorn said on his single election.
Germany’s new warship is repeated
The German Navy had to take action in 2014 to replace the warship of the warship that was in its late years, but it would not be until the next year, at least, because of corrupt regulations and rising costs, reports the media in the country.
"Rheinland-Pfalz," a new Baden-Wuerttemberg-the quick-season ship captain of the war department entered Sierra Leone, reaching mid-2019, with a military spokesman, such as Die Zeit Newspaper.
The ship had to combine its marine force in 2004, but the difficult issue of poverty created a problem for the Gug project.
The last 2007 Sea Force ordered four Baden-Wuertemberg-class ships to replace the old Bremen-Class warships.
It is well known that there is a helmsman, anti-flight and anti-shipmachine devices, as well as some of the stealth technology, such as small radar, red bulbs and sound signatures.
Other important features include a long period of maintenance — the new warship must be possible from the port of the country to a distance of two years.
However, in a series of delays, which means that German-Germany ships are allowed to power beyond the sea when they start to serve, Die Zeit points out that they are already out of date.
Bad lucked F125 was the latest headline of a warship, when German Navy authorities banned the use of the ship to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time, when the ship of the sea was brought again by the ship, and was brought again by the ship.
Little is known about the reason why the return comes, Germany's media have cited the critical "Software and Hardware Failures" that would make the ship useless if it were under the war.
The lack of software was especially important, since Baden-Wuerttenberg-Seave could be built by 120 mariners, half the manpower needed by the former Bremen's immediate warship.
The ship has been found to be dramatically difficult, and this has reduced its capacity and has forced it to increase its marine power.
7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the comparable ship used by the Germans in World War II.
Alongside the corrupt Hardware, the overall project is becoming a matter of concern, including the training of mariners.
It has been reported that from the start of €2.2 billion, €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) has been dramatically received.
The problems surrounding the new swift warship are particularly important with the recent warning of a reduction in the capacity of the German Navy.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peer Bartels, the chairman of the German Parliamental Protection Committee, has already announced that the Marine Force is indeed "suffering up ships capable of fishing".
Officials say that the matter has increased steadily, because old ships have stopped working, but they have not been replaced.
He lamented that no Baden-Wuertemberg-Surreamberg-Swift warships were able to combine the Navy.
National Confidential Listener in the Secret Life of Clergy Birds
A new study is being carried out on Scotish Highland to show how bats form the earth for their food.
The discovery, it is believed, hates new light on the behavior of the unique mammals and commands that they lead to future security activities.
Scientists follow the study of Scotland in the national flag with a common and loud voice, as well as the long-eared brownbird and Daubenton in Inverwee Gardens, Western Rose.
The time period is generally around the main areas for the activity of the bat.
Using hand-holders, NHS workers and volunteers conduct mobile studies.
All sound records confirm the call of the lyrebird and what species it is doing.
A community map and report is prepared to create a detailed image of their nature.
Rob Dewar, the NTS Natural Protection Adviser, confirms the hope that the results will prove the importance of the birds that hatch in which areas of life can be found and that we will use some species for their use.
This information helps the Department of Public Life to determine the benefits of choosing to protect forests, such as green work, bats, and related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the whole UK has declined dramatically over the past decade.
Building and developing are in danger of destroying nests and the lives of experts.
It can pose a threat to wind and lightning, such as flying papers and certain building materials, as well as a chemical attack on cattle.
The birds of the vulture are certainly not hidden.
But when their experience of hunting is with hunting their food, their ears are more useful than they can see.
They use a complex tricky method to find the souls correctly or to identify obstacles in the way they fly.
NTS, over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and around the soil, it takes the bats, which are important to care for 76,000 shields.
He said: "Several studies, camp examination and sometimes rescue work, ten trained professionals."
The organization has set up the first and only species of Scotland bats to live for eight, even in the Terrave East Dumfries and Galloway.
His successor, David Thompson, claimed that his inheritance was a proper domain for them.
"This is a good place for bats in Threave," he said.
We have old buildings, many old and satisfied trees, and all of them beautiful nests of life.
But there is not much about bats, so it helps us to understand more fully what we need in order to develop our work here and elsewhere."
The destruction of a parent’s nest, which emphasizes the need to check that no bats exist before performing maintenance on property, may eliminate up to 400 women and children, possibly the general population.
It is a crime to kill, attack, disturb, or destroy bats.
Elisabeth Ferrel, the protection of the Scotish clown bird, has encouraged its people to come to help as my own officer.
She said, "We still need to learn a lot about our bats, and I do not know how many of our many species are appropriate."
As the lawyer prepared to charge German magazine, Ronaldo ignored the charges of forced rape
“ People want to introduce themselves, ” says Christiano Ronaldo, who has been accused of rape against him of “false news. ”
The lawyers are prepared to charge Der Spiegel, the German news magazine that released the case.

He made the report "False News" public in Instagram for 142 million of his followers, Ronaldo, 33.
"I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't.
Today's false news,” said five times on camera by Ballon d'Or.
"They want to introduce themselves using my name.
Normal
They want to be famous by calling my name, but this is the work.
"I'm a happy person and everyone's good," the conversation added a smile
According to Routers, "the unreceptive habeas corpus in the case of Ronaldo's lawyers is preparing to accuse Dr. Spiegel of his case on personal freedom."
“ The players, ” says lawyer Christian Schertz, “have recently violated the most serious individual rights, and he wants to make a profound contribution to the moral collapse of the agreement. ”
The case was filed in Palms in June 2009 at the Hotel and Las Vegas Casino
Nevada Clark County District Court reportedly headed to the office of Ronaldo and Mayorga, where they met on the basis of documents filed in the evening circle
Ronaldo kneels at the head of the charge, "99 percent" "good man"
As the documents show, Ronaldo found that the couple had sex and that they were in agreement
Mayorga explained that she also went to the police and that she had photos of her injuries in the hospital but that she finally agreed outside the court to “fear revenge” and“ not be humiliated ”

At the time of his attack, he had reached the tip of the Manchester United Real Madrid, which was passed on to the giants of Italy, Juve, by €100 million
Brexit (British out of the European Union); UK 'can regret it forever' lost its car members
If the Brixit lost its car to the world's leader, 'the UK can regret it forever', says business manager Greg Clark
If Toyota UK Brittin had added intolerance to the EU, he would have said to the BBC that the Bernaston factory would temporarily stop production for Derby
"We want harmony," said Mr. Clark
The Japanese motor vehicle’s entrepreneur, says, may have an influence on the border of Brexit where there is uncertainty
The Toyota's Auris and Avenice factory, Burnaston’s factory, produced more than 150000 vehicles, has been sent to the 90,000 European Union
"By my sight, Brittin will stop at our factory from a product produced by the EU at the end of April," said Marvin Cooke, director of the Toyota administration at Burnston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised concerns about how to break free from instability in EU business, including Hondan, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, e.g., following Brexit, when he prepared the small Oxford factory for a month
According to car manufacturers, their main concern is the danger of an unsettling circle
Toyota's line of research is guided by a "just-in-time" basis, so they are presented every 37 minutes to seniors in command cars from UK and EU suppliers
On April 29, the industry says that if the UK were to leave the EU without compromise, it could break down border rules, resulting in delays and shortening of goods
In Derbyshire, the company said that holding more goods than a day was impossible for Toyota, and production could have stopped
About her future relationship with the EU, Mr. Clark says that the government plan of Thessa May "is just a combination to eliminate inspections on the ground."
"We need harmony: we need this opportunity, not only to say that we should be happy, but also to say that we need agreement that can make this happen," says BBC Radio 4 today.
"We want to continue the closest chain that was most effective, as shown not only by Toyota but also by other producers."
He could not tell how long Toyota’s production would stop, but he warned that his increased cost could reduce the factory’s competitiveness and job creation in the long term.
Peter Tsouvalaris, a 24-year-old employee of the U.N. Society in Bernaston, was very concerned that members would never return if they went to practice.
The government's word-sponsor said: "We have made a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosentein can be extended again, says White House
According to Donald Trump, the great benefit of having a meeting with Rod Rosentein by the attorney-in-law may well be added to another week, and the reason is that the conflict with Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate from the Supreme Court, has continued.
Rosentein controls the Russian intervention, the relations between Trump and Russia, and the work of her special expert Robert Mueller, who is examining the accountability of the President for justice.
Trump to put Muller's freedom at risk, deputy deputy attorney-in-law fired and did not expel him, the news spread to Washington for months.
Early in this month, Rosentein read about what he could do to remove the president in his 25th revision scheme, as if he were too busy to draw up his story when he talked to Trump.
Rosentin has denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House and reported that he would leave in the middle of the day.
Instead, the United Nations has been informed that there will be a Thursday meeting with Trump at New York.
Trump Rusentein said that he would "choose" him, but the meeting was delayed to eliminate the possible conflict with members of the prison, which was confirmed by Kavanaugh and Dr Christine Blasey Ford, accused of sexual harassment.
In view of the question of Kavanaugh Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation, all members of the Legislative Council should participate in the delay.
The head of the Trump Information Office, Sarah Sanders, is on the Fox News Sunday.
He asked about the Rosentein meeting, and said, "I'm not sitting this day, maybe this week, but things are going on in the Supreme Court.
But we see, and I always want to let the media know when something new exists."
Some journalists may be testing the same assurance: Sanders did not give a press release on the White House in front of the press on September 10.
The author asked Chris Wallace why.
According to Sanders, the lack of expression "sabi" did not hate TV reporters, but she said, "I agree with the fact that they think."
She has therefore commented on a stronger direct link between the Trump and the media.
Referring to no evidence, she added: "We have seen the numbers of these numbers older than any previous president."
Descriptions will still exist, and Sanders said, "If the media have the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, that is better than I am.
We've been trying so hard to do that for the past few weeks, and you've seen us do it so much, and you can speak to the president of the United States.
Trump always receives questions when he participates in the White House or open meetings or when he leaves with large guests at the Public Assembly.
There are only a few congregations in the press.
This week, the president of New York shows a startling aspect of what he is doing, before the press gathers.
The health spokesman wrote fear on Brexit for the EU staff at Scotland NHS
/Health spokesman wrote to the EU staff in Scotland NHS to continue their thanks and letter from the Dutch-Brexit.
Jane Freeman MSP sent a letter from the EU within less than six months.
The Scottish government is determined to meet the cost of living for EU citizens in its services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "As for the release between the summer, between UK and EU, the trend continues, leading to a decision to be expected.
But the UK government was about to terminate the arrangement for possible compromises.
And I know that the times of great disquieting shall weep for thee, both of them.
That is why I want to tell each member of the team how much I value the contribution I have made to their nationality.
From all over the EU, and more partners, they have produced useful experience and skills that will strengthen and improve the health service, and have painted the patient and his team.
Scotland is your home, and we want them to stay very long."

Foreign rulers are subject to higher printing obligations when they buy UK property
Foreign rulers are also required to pay a high fee for printing when they buy U.S. property and are used to help the homeless in the context of new Tory schemes
Corbyn’s youth’s attractions reduce success
The printing obligation is imposed on the nonpayment of UK tax
Each year, the house - to - house store is maintained by up to 120 million dollars
Foreign rulers bought UK property, and they were charged with high printing charges - they are used to help the homeless in addition to the money, since Teresa May is now known.
The activity has been seen as an attempt to reduce the success of Corbyn’s career in attracting young voters by making a commitment to provide affordable homes and by linking them to the higher incomes.
The increase in printing will be imposed on individuals and organizations that do not pay UK tax, which will also help to combat the government's traffic.
In addition to the current printing obligation, which may have been higher than normal, it may have been up to 3 per cent two years ago, including the high size of the second house and the purchase-to-lease.
The fund portfolio is set to stand at 120 million.
Newly built homes in London have been purchased by 13 per cent of the population of the UK, making it difficult for the first time to set foot on the floor of houses.
Because of the large number of foreign states that spend most of their time abroad, many rich areas of the country — especially the capital city — have become “citys of the Spirit”.
Boris Johnson, who came to the new directive, is responsible for two weeks ’ reduction of the tumber requirement that many young people have their own home.
He was responsible for not using large construction facilities, and/or Mayy urged them to leave their role in housing that was capable of repairing the “dignity of homes” of Britain.
Mr. Corbyn Ian has introduced a series of planned housing upgrades, rental control and the release of "safe" housing.
He desires to give the council great authority to build new houses.
E/ro Mayrat, "I had said last year that I would use my prime minister to re-establish British dream -- that life should be better for all generations.
And to repair our broken houses.
Brittin will be open to people who want to live all the time, to establish it, and to start a new life.
Yet, it is not right that it is easy to buy a house for foreign organizations, as is the case with British workers, UK non-residents, and other countries.
For many people, homelessness has been very remote, and the reality of sleeping on the dignified streets has continued.
Jack Rose: 'My last wish is to rule Scotland'
The head of Sunderland Jack Rose said that his "last wish" was to be a Scottish trainer.
Now League One, a three-point lower northern estuary group at the top of Scott, 42, is making the struggle to re-scatter life.
St. Myrren has been moved this summer to the stadium of light from his return to the Scotish Premiersship, leading to the past games.
"I want to play for my country like a player."
I found a B-ball, "Rox for BBC Scotland's voice."
As a child, I grew up with my father in Scotland with a lot of eyes on Hampden, and it was always something that he gave me back.
This chance is possible if I am successful in running a group.
Ross successors such as Sunderland Training Dick Advocate, David Moyees, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet e Paulo Di Canio.
His name, which was built following his departure from the city of Barnsley and Ipswich, was said by the former head of Alloa Athletics to the point of causing no anxiety in such a large group.
"For me, success at this hour is like, 'Can I return this group to Premier League?'
The reason for this group's formation and supply is beyond doubt that it will be included in the Premier League,” he said.
"This does not want a simple job, but it is only if I can return this group that I see as a success."
Rose stayed in Dumbarton under defense training and spent only three months in charge of the 15-month training course in Hearts' Department, in this training job.
He helped to revive Alloa from the debased into the third class, and St. Mirren turned them from the debased side of the competition to the title of victory in the following time.
And Ross says that his work in Clyde, Hartlepoul, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy is now very good at playing.
"Perhaps it was a proper crossing," recalls Alloa, where he found Alloa.
I've heard from my heart that training is a real match for me, and I've been playing more than just playing.
It seems confusing because I have made good progress, I have had a reasonable life, and I have found some reasonable heights.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things that you should pass through every week.
Again and again, he has the right feeling of self - worth to train him with his work’s stress and pressure.
I always wanted to be trained, and now I'm working, and I have a feeling that I was a very good old age for myself."

The summer heat has increased income for British drink sales on the market, but it has placed greater pressure on restaurants.
Drinking bar groups have made 2.7 percent sales growth in Julie, but restaurant income was 4.8 percent lower, as the figures show.
Peter Martin, S.C.C.C., said: “The next sunlight and the long - expected participation of England in the Olympic Cup meant that Julie would follow the same pattern of events as the previous month, and the restaurants would have been hit more and more by food than 2.8 percent.
In June, the food trade caused 1.8 percent of the fall in Julie
Drinkers and restaurants who focus on drinking have shown the most powerful growth in the restaurants.
And even those who focus on food, but those who do so, are not as shocking as those who move around a restaurant, and they have been seriously damaged.
People seem to come out just for a drink.
With well-informed liquor and alcohol sales, there was a 6.6 per cent increase for the month, a three percent drop in food prices.
“ These results will continue as we see them from the end of April.
They remain very influential when the influence of climate and major social or sports supply is brought to the market outside the home market.
It is not surprising that food groups are continuing their struggle, but that the price pressure of 4.8 per cent is higher than the average year-old price.
He tells us when the long, hot summers would not have come when the hungry merchants could not have come, and he says that the longer the heat we spent in August would have given us a little short time off. "
Overall sales growth was 2.7 per cent in the Julien market, with sales and restaurants, including the opening of new ones, reflecting the chilling process of starting new services.
The Yuki's retail, alcohol and restaurant sales controller, Cooper Pitch Traffic, has a total of some 9 billion mobile business groups that collect and track us, and a model of engineering that has been set up.
One in five children has social media uses to hide from their parents

Elid Doyle will be a "Voice of Letters" in Scotland's athletic board.
Elid Doyle was elected director of Scotland’s Ethics Board at the general council of the governor’s body.
Dale says that it is a great opportunity for Scotland’s famous tracts and field athletes and for the chairman to take advantage of the practice of Ian Betty, which has covered much of her past ten years of sports.
"Elid has great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, Yukena, and we're sure that Scottish athletics will benefit greatly from bringing her to the board."
She said, "I hope I can help to make the right contribution and to conduct the sports in Scotland, and I hope I am eager to be the sound of the athletes."

On Twitter, he wrote: “A month ago, I had the accident of suddenly losing control of my body.
I could not walk.
The physicians spoke of the time when he would decide whether or to what degree I should recover.

The breast - milk - extract device comparing mothers to cows divides an ad on the Internet
The breast - milk press divides advertising online, comparing it with the milking cows
Regarding the beginning of what has been called the “first silent breast-dresser,” the computer screen technology has been released by the company Elvie, which has created an emotive music video that shows freedom for mothers to express themselves.
When four real mothers sang a single song that included this type of poem, they sang in a sheepfold full of straw, "Yes, I don't say but I don't see myself, but you don't see anything," and "Perhaps you don't notice well, these are not cow's breasts, they're mine."
It goes on: "Take it out, get it out, get it out, feed my young people, get it out, get it out, get it out, hit my women."
However, an announcement published on the website of the organization has generated debate over the Internet.
With 77,000 visions and hundreds of messages, the video has received mixed responses, and many of the animals' cells are growing in their exuberance of "depressions"
"The use of cows to promote this product is a very low decision.
One/one wrote, as we do, to give birth and milk, except if they were born within a few days of being stolen by their parents.
Elvis’s breast milk can be stored in the breast cervix (Elvi/mother) of the nurse
Another commented: “It is very disturbing for both mothers and children in a way that they can understand.
But why don't we use mothers who should care for their babies to introduce breast milk?"
Another man added: "This is an ad with an era of knowledge"
Others defended the ad, believing that a woman found the single song "very funny"
"I think this is a great imagination.
If I had one, I would have been breast - feeding.
He made me to drink like a cow.
The ad was somewhat unremitting, but I took what I wanted to say.
He wrote: “This is the best harvest of all time. ”
Another commented: “This is a funny ad that focuses on mothers (often used in their workplaces or toilets) and those who feel like "dams".
This catapult is not an ad that praises the industry or that condemns it for good. ”
At the end of the video, the women's group announced that they were all shaving through the chests of the women's unannounced pans.
The theory behind the campaign is based on the belief that many women who use their breasts are hearing us as cows.
However, with no complete voice, no wires or tubes, and no way unknown, the Elvis sits under the care of the nurse, gives freedom to move for women, to take their children and to use them to get out.
Anna Balerin, founder of Mazar and Ecdi, commented: "The Elvis’s spring is so a evolutionary product that it needs to start with courage and anger.
We want to look at the opposite line between self - conscious women and milk cows, and we want to put the community’s attention on all the wrongs, and we want to show the unbelievable sense of freedom that the new spring brings — and so on — in a pleasant and dignified way
It is not the first time that the Elvis handles the front pages.
During the Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children, using the product, appeared on the fashion display at Dziner Martha Jacobowski.
Hundreds of refugee children have moved safely to the tent camp at the border of Texas.
The number of refugee children in prison has reached its peak, but monthly migrations have remained unchanged, because according to a decision by the Trump Administration, the worst discourses and policies have made it more difficult for children to accept the costs.
According to experience, most of the beds are refugees who are not themselves informed and who are at risk of being able to stay in the country when they are approached to ask for a child.
The concern increased when federal officials in June, as well as other senior members of their families, announced that the information was shared by the immigration authorities.
Last week, Immigrants and customs chief officer, Matthew Albins Egenzi, testified that over a dozen people had been held in prison for children who had not reached adulthood.
The Agency has found that of the 70 percent of the subsequent arrests, 70 percent have no prior criminal record.
"The 80 percent of the individuals who are in charge or who are members of the camaraderie are in this country on the illegal road, and most of them are criminals who come from elsewhere.
So we'll continue to follow up on the other individuals we're mourning, ” said Mr. Albino.
According to Shelter Warkers, in order to speed up the process of the children, the authorities introduced new rules requiring that the courts be brought before the courts within 60 days of their arrest.
Many appeal to the immigration judge on a voluntary basis, not in person, but through a video conference call.
Those who were thought not to meet the conditions were quickly expelled from the country.
According to reports released in recent months, as in Shelter and Central, the children's longer prison periods, the greater the risk of anxiety or grief, leading to forced labor and escape attempts.
It is said by activists that the most subtle signs of neglect of a child struggling for a measure of this kind are high on a larger scale, such as Thornilo.
Many have added that by getting children to prepare emotionally or to say good-bye to their friends without enough time to move into the city of tents, many may be exacerbating the disturbing situation they are struggling with.
Let the Syrian forces leave France and Turkey
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Minister Walid Al-Moalem of Foreign Affairs called for the return of Syrian refugees to their homeland, but the country’s war now takes an eighth year
Moalm, who serves as Deputy Prime Minister, says that his foreign powers are found on Syrian soil on the illegal road, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that he "gives it a proper remedy".
He told the audience: “The tax will have to be released, and under no circumstances ”
In Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, where over millions of people have been evicted from their homes, Moalm has said: “The war of terror has ended. ”
Damascus said, "The battle will continue until this holy war is cleared of all the territories of Syria from the terrorist groups and from any foreign body of the law."
The United State has in Syria a number of 2000 troops primarily training and consulting the Syrian Arabs, who are opposed by President Al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 foot soldiers in a war-torn country.
He said that it was good for refugees to return to the situation, and he blamed the "distribution of unreasonable fears" that prompted refugees "a few Western countries" to refrain from returning.
“We have called on international society and human support organizations to develop ways of returning, ” he said.
“ They are giving the form of politics that must be human ”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no relief aid until a political agreement is reached between the pursuer and the opposition.
The UN diplomats said that the recent agreement to establish a free peace regime between Russia and Turkey, with the last strong possession of the rebels, had given rise to pressure to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish accord has taken on the scale of the attack by Syrian forces in Russia, which support the three million people in the country.
However, he was convinced that the treaty had a “clear end” and hoped that the military action would bring about an Ilama, including the “complete destruction” of the Nouvelles, who were associated with Alkaedai.
The UN envoy Stéphane de Mestura hoped that soon he would hold the first meetings of a new committee from the government and from the opponents in order to set the stage for the Syrian regime and to pave the way for elections.
Moam has set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government, warning that the assembly work should be limited to "reviewing the current provisions of the Constitution" and that there should be no interference.
Why Trump Wins a Second Time of Authority

A choice will flow like a flood of money in the competitions of the House of Counsel, when there is a stay of part-time power that is well organized outside.
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvanian dollar saw a huge amount of money, but thanks to the failure of the congressional districts, I brought two seats into a single seat race
This recently re-established Pittsburgh district border brings into the competition of Democratic Representative Conner Lamb, who won a special election last spring.
The Lamb competes with another seat in the Republic, Keith Rosefus, who now represents the new 17th, which covers the former 12th circuit of Pennsylvania.
It was after the former High Court of Pennsylvania declared that the maps had changed their boundaries in ways that would benefit the republicans in a way that did not respect the Constitution.
The new 17th competition in the campaign created a sudden turn of events between the main party financial supporters, the Democratic Campein Community Committee (DCC) and The National Republican Campin Committee (ENRC).
Lamb is a prominent name in Pennsylvania after having won a narrow victory over the unique choice of the 18th district of Congress in March, Pennsylvania.
That seat had been held by a republican over ten years, and President Donald Trump had won the circuit by 20 points.
Political analysts have given them a narrow advantage over democracy.
El Salvador, with its support to China, has made it sad, and then she has stopped doing so.
The diplomats pointed out that despite a little pressure from the Dominican Republic and Panama, they had already recognized Beijing.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a warm relationship with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama and had a union at the Panamanian hotel until the formation of the Governing Body by the Creators.
With the permission of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Heath Nort decided to call officials of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama “on their decision not to give recognition to Taiwan” at the beginning of the month.
But the sanctions were considered, in 2017, only on El Salvador, where it received $140 million in support of custom and economic support, including drug control.
In Central America, severe unemployment and suicide are harmful for Central American countries, with financial relief reductions and long-term visa limits.
As internal meetings show improvement, North American and Central American authorities have moved from one stage to another to monitor the high officials' meeting, which focuses on security and economic prosperity, to prevent refugees from moving to the United States.
But by mid-September, as the top management wanted the meeting to move forward, El Salvador had made it clear that any planned sanctions in El Salvador would be effective.
Vice-President Mike Pens, in a way that indicates the invisible meaning of the government's policy on corruption, has now been elected to speak at a conference scheduled for the middle of October.
And the three American messengers returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or punishments from Washington.
L. Bolton White House, a spokesman for the debate, refrained from commenting on the list of three American authorities, including two diplomas that agreed to be held without publicizing internal discussions.
A review of their accounts has been confirmed on a case where their accounts are close to the administration and where there is no manifest name at all.
Study history
The next possible extra capacity, now that I have so much evidence in the community's record, is a special consultant's report, Robert Muller, who observes that there is a possible obstacle to justice in Mir.
According to a few, Mr. Müller is turning the investigation into an attack on our choices.
If the Congress changes its position, as it prepares to be presented to the electors, Mr. Trump will be held accountable for his body, perhaps the end of the panel of judges.
That's a lot of people, and that's not thinking that the fall of Mir.Tramp is the only one in Europe who will be like him.

Federal researchers are asking for the death penalty for terrorist suspects in New York City
The federal prosecutor’s law in New York is asking for a death sentence to be imposed on Cyflulo Psipov, a terrorist attack that killed 8 people.
Sepopov, 30, in October, at Lower Manhathan, on the Western Highway, he carried out his work in the interest of renting a car, thereby harming the road’s drivers and footmen.
Researchers need to make sure that the basis for the death warrant in the southern part of New York will be met, that the death warrant will be given, and that Sepopouve is intended to cause serious bodily harm.
Both cases will have a life sentence on the basis of the court's document.
A week before the attack, the Federal Supreme Court filed Sipov with the regular use of organized crimes on 22-year charges, 8-year-old murder and motor vehicles in violation of the law and damage.
According to the researcher, the attack “desired to plan and prepare a long time, ” which he described as“ very cruel and blind. ”
The document states: “Sipulo Habiblayevik Sepov of Diego Enrique Angeli, Nicholas Clives, Herran Feruchi, Heran Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Demian Pagonko have caused harm and loss to family and friends. ”
Five victims came from Argentina.
The South New York region has been in a decade since the death sentence was finally hosted.
The defendant, Callid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two litigants, but in September 2009, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The final death sentence in the New York Federal case was imposed in 1953 by Julies and Etel Rosenberg, married couples who were sentenced to death for helping to receive information from the Soviet Union two years before the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death in the electric chair on July 19, 1953.
On the basis of the court's document, the citizen of Uzbekistan, Sipove, said that he did not feel remorse for the last days of the attack.
According to the police, he said that he had no regrets about his work and felt good about it.
Sapiove, an ISS terrorist group who saw videos on his cell phone, told investigators that he had been motivated to attack him.
The police told me that in the hospital room, ISIS terrorist groups would be asked to hang a flag on him.
In the 22 charges brought against him, he said, "I am innocent of the crime."
The federal public attorney for Sepopov described David Paton as "we are very sad" in their judgment.
"Patton explains that the question of death penalty is likely to prolong the mental disorder of any person involved in this process, rather than a firm life imprisonment, in which there is no release of the death penalty in any way.
The Sipovists had already asked the lawyers not to ask for a death sentence.
Tori MP has requested that Nigel Farage be placed in charge of the Brixite squares.
He chose to ‘mobilize the armies of the people’s army ’ in opposition to Turi Confrence.
The former Uquip leader pointed out that one of the words ‘to hear the heat’ from the Eurospatics is a key factor in the EU’s performance of the Tiresa Mayy MPs.
Mr. Farregg, a permanent observer of the United Kingdom, said that he was still leaving the United Kingdom as a British writer.
My problems, Mrs. May, however, are quite different from those of the main Toriots, who were deeply involved in protests against the city of Rexyst.
The main thing is to try to get them to agree on the plans to prevent chryxtrops, the oscillators, and the coming EU attack.
In contrast to the unsuccessful plan, the co-ordinators said that I would work hard to make an agreement with Brussels and that Irosseptics and the worker would be forced to choose from her and from the trouble.
Mr. Bona said that the release meant that he would leave the collection in Solihull to check the checks.

"In our own country, we must establish our own laws."
Mr. Bonn has destroyed the people's polls that have changed since 2016: "British sows want to change their minds and stay on the beach."
Tori Brixiter Andre Jenkins said in November, the reporters said: ‘I’m easy to say: ‘I’m the prime minister, and the people listen to him.
‘Chekers are not popular among the people, the opponents don't prefer them, nor is it known that our parties and activists make our first choice.
Please leave Chekers alone, and let them hear."
A message to Mr. May, he added: "The Prime Minister is keeping his work by keeping his word."
Mr. Faraage told the politicians that they should ‘feel warm’ if they want to win the 2016 decision of the people of Christendom.
‘This is a matter of trust between us — the people — and our Politicans.’
We will not allow them to do this,
He added: ‘You feel the warmth of what I want to do with Rexy, who wants you to make part of our politics.
‘We are gathering together the people's gunmen in this city who have won the Brix, and we will not rest until we are able to support ourselves, support ourselves, and are proud of the United Kingdom.’
Until now, the rest of the conflict has been fought in Berningham for two hours and in the middle of the city before it breaks out.
This week, after the group had been released, an activist scream caused the Torrich Brixite to rise on the boards.
Mr. Adonis, Lord of Power, began to worry about the safety of those who held to the tradition of Adonis, who mocked him, as he had begun to at the beginning of Conversus.

There's nothing good like Brixit, he's added.

From Paul, there is a good starting point, and they can dry Hamilton up, and they can invite them to attack Vetel and Veteel, as they faced the first two rounds.
Wettel goes to the well first and leaves a Hamilton on the road to run, and the decision needs to be made.
He did so and left on the side of Wettel, but Hamilton went on an equal course, and competed with the three corners, as he saw himself as a Ferrari driver.
Max Verstapin was in the seventh row, starting with the last row, and having been born on the 21st.

This is the worst real language of today
President Trump made fun of the President of the Central Cabinet of the political community on Saturday's occasion, who did not issue a letter from Christine Blaise Ford, and did not issue a letter in the highest court case against Bert Kavanah.
In Western Virginia, the president did not give a testimony to the Ford address, but he did not give a testimony on what was happening to the public on the behalf of the CNET Committee, and what was happening in Sint was "amage, ugly and unbelievable".
Something and something that could happen will last a few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry people, and when you see the average, ugly, and unbelievable."
"You see those who have been released and left, and they say, "Oh, I haven't done it."
I didn't do it."
Are you aware?
Did you expose my penis?
Remember her answer... you exposed the document - "O, o, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't bring it out.
Good and wait a minute.
No, we didn't, he added, he attracted the attention of the Senator.
Because of the lack of evidence, she refused to leave her office in Kavanah in February, and now in May – in recent years.
"Dor. I didn't hide. Ford's case, I didn't publish the story," she told the committee, as The Hill reported.
She asked me to keep them in secret, and I kept them secret."
But her rejection did not come before the president, who commented at the Saturday night meeting: "What do you say, this is a bad language of humanity?
You may not have done anything about it, but there is the bad language I've seen."
The Supreme Court's case has continued, three women who have been accused of sexual assault, and, according to the president's democracy, they are bringing charges to the end of his case.
In no way have they decided to receive power again.
You've seen the bad guy, but it's not about who's going to hurt him, so think about who you have to control to get power, "and think about the president's report.

Learning about Paddington’s greatest success is a great deal of joy.”
According to her father, before they wrote a little doll bear, the children’s book, which was written by a BBC cameraman, did not give up on the unacceptable work, and a year later he died of a “smoothing” book that she had added.
Paddington, as she said, the "necessarys of the family" added to the success of the end.
He was a quiet person, and he's not bragging, ” she said.
"Because Paddington's lounge is real, you're proud of them when you say that what you'd have to do is not your job.
The success of Paddington was so much seen, as I thought.
Despite his creativity and imagination, he is always grateful to Paddington.
Now I want to have my daughter dead, and I want her on the phone.

This I have to wait to find out.
Whether you cry or not, I am surrounded by my family and people.
I must gather together in truth."
Now that she has lost her son, Mr. Edin-Lapiros is on Hazen, but the plane's landings are on the way to an experiment.
"No one knows," she said.
"I have reduced my head, and a mountain is all flowing.
It was hard to explain, but it was on flight when I felt so bad about it.

The future results of a study by F.B.I.
"I guess, if we could find what he was asking of us -- the study was very time-limited, and widespread -- we should even bring a little unity," said Mr. Flick on Saturday, and the Committee added that "I would have differed" and protested in the womb.
Why, Mr. Kavanav and his supporters of the Riplican wanted FBI not to do the study.
The mystery of his storage is in view of time.
The mid-term election was only five weeks away, in June, as expected, with the republics working in the new Heil, weakened in the experiment, and wanted to find the main leader of the high court.
George W. Bush took his phone calls to call the centers, Mr. Cavanav supported them, worked for and through White House, and was the owner of Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has been released?
There will be a choice in the Senate, 51 republics and 49 democracies.

Name Korea’s destructive numbers “fall ” at the root of Kim’s list
According to Kim Jong-un, according to many in South Korea, seven years before their arrival in power, they have been the source of the law of the bear of Korea.
Byong-Syug Park, South Union Ministry, has reported 1,127 diseases since last year — compared with 2,706 in 2011.
According to Mr. Park, in the narrowest north of Korea and China, the highest accused are the most important of these smugglers.
What kind of public comment did Pionńg not give?
Many North Korean traitors acquired South Korean citizenship.
Like him, over 30,000 South Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the 1953 War.
Many flights, along the way of China, with China, have a long border with Korea, and this is the most simple of the most hidden military dmZ (DMZ) aircraft from both Koreas.
China has seen these traitors, not as refugees, but as illegal travelers, and they have been forced to return to their countries.
South and North relations — both sides of the war — have changed in recent months.
Early this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to make a trust in the destruction of Newkler Hill.
After this historic visit to Singapore by President Donald Tramp and Kim Jong-un, the new arrivals, also agreed to the creation of a free Korean Pennsuula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, made a serious mistake of UEIS law.
"In this case, we have no confidence in the national security of our country, and there is no reason to put ourselves in front of us, according to Mr. Ri, at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Britt Kavanav called him "hesterical," and is not qualified to serve as a high court.
Under-house officer Nancy Pelosi said that he was not qualified to serve in the "hysterical" and "high court" by calling the Supreme Court Brit Kavanakh."

"I can't help you, but if this was the case with the woman who thought she'd do it, "Hysterical," she gave a witness about the actions of Kavanav before the Senate Justice Committee.
Kavanav protested against the emotional charges of sexual assaults on Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, saying: "Children.
In the opening talk, Cavanav was emotionally active, and his family and the Heiscule years were under discussion.
The committee criticized democracys, accused them of being "an old view and organized murder", and set up a group of angry librarians because of not being elected for the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed in Kavanavan's testimony, confirming that he should not serve the Supreme Court, because he put pressure on democracies.
"As you can imagine, he isolated himself from these talks and from the Clintons and Democracys," he said.
When Pelosi was asked to attack Kavanav, she was able to, and the democracys had obtained the voice of the House of the Replacement.
"To be sure -- he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, but he's now here to be in court, "Pellosi said.
Now here is Judge D.C. Kavanav.
Pylossi added to the democracy he was worried about in the form of a state in which he could be ruled: to be taken as a difficult, loyal to justice.
According to him, Kavanav is asking that some Supreme Court decisions be reversed.
"It's not the time of the hysterical, the people are expected to go to court, "it's not that good," "Al Pelosi.
And women must practice it.
This well-founded speech is now, as the months and years go by, and you can't find it without crying.
"We're crying of rage, "The Stenum/Stenum is 45 years later."
"I don't think so, you?"
She goes on, "Help the woman who used to be an exemplar, when she got angry, but when she started making a strategy and started to cry, she was talking to the people, "You can't be sad, 'cause I've been crying.
They are angry."
And she continued.
And I thought, "Come on."
For from the foundation ye shall not help these men.
I remember one of my past jobs, whispering, crying at the top of a man's office, and the big woman who held me in the back of my neck — cold work — always pushing me down slowly.
"You cry, you'll never be judged," he told me.
"They don't know your rage.
"They will remember you, as you have been commanded, and rejoice because they have come to you."
Patricia Squander, a woman of the Democratic Concordance, joined Colorado, and Grey Hart in the presidential race.
In addition to Mr. Hart, she learned that there was no reason why she could not compete as a Tristantial.
"That's not good thinking," she laughed to me 30 years later.
"There were seven other rivals in the race, and the runners were looking for the last of them.
As the people called out, "white snow and the seven potatoes."
Since the campaign was delayed, she was with the collection of money, and she could not take part in the race until $2 million.
There was a field of defeat.
As he knew, her supporters would give the men $1,000, but only $250 would give her.
She asked, "Do they think that they have found the least?"
When she announced that she was not starting the usual campaign, she was in emotional distress. All I did was thank you, thank you, and with the fear of the system for this, it is difficult to collect money and for the players from the representatives, who are close to, and who are angry at, sexual discrimination.
"You think I'm hurt, "to ask how she's got re-calling printers.
"Now you think Clenex is my associate sponsor.
I remember this thinking, and I would like to put it on it.
"Did she cry?"

China has promised to fight for Eues and the world’s second largest economy will soon change.
To get Washington to come up with interest, but in front of the public, Lyce was a shameless man, the president of China.
Now, if, according to experts, she can play right in Ging, the pressure of the war trade to help China properly must long-term plans to reduce the economic ties of both countries.
As soon as rapid political decisions are brought down from Washington, or Beijing, the economy in the country, it is very difficult to see how, as Abigail Grace said, the study group is focusing on Asia, as it thinks, the security of Central America.
