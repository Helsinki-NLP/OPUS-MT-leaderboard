I think he ate something like ten shells.
When does this begin?
Let's see if we can do it next time.
The car accident happened right before.
I was gonna call him, but I forgot.
It's unlucky.
Is that serious?

Since when do you care what's going on?
Are you interested in your work?
He's got more books than anything else together.
Welcome back.
I'm sure they're talking about what happened.
Would you hand it over?
Do you want to do that or not?
If you don't understand, ask.
There's nothing more important than friends.
Whether something is a good idea or not, it's not a matter of opinion.
The story was so complicated I couldn't follow.

You imagine things.
I've been learning English for five years.

He destroyed not only himself financially, but also the family.
He's not worth anything.
I can't get over breaking up with you.
I want to know how it's possible.
Where's my dad?
According to the forecast, it's snow tomorrow.
I've got a tough puzzle.
Is there a little restaurant around here?
If you could help me, I'd make it.
Get there early.
I didn't mean to do that.
At least try to be careful.
Tom looks sleepy.
It's lunch time.
There's not enough room here for 40 people.

Sleep deep.
Hey, thanks for flying with us.
You better consult with your teacher.
I'd like to learn that language, but I don't need it practical.
Would you sign the list?
Tom asked us to return his basic payment.
Is that your wallet?
Do they take care of a dog?
Tom's in season.
I just want to focus on the positive.
I have to find a way to make a lot of money.
I see you made a good impression.
Once you've decided to get into the profession, you can't change your mind.
If I were her, I wouldn't have raised my hands yet.
Tom ate it out loud.
It depends how you deal with it.
I'll teach you everything you have to know.
You're fair.
I'm kidding you.
You've got five minutes to figure this out.
Where's my hat?
The fat is not good for your health.
French teaches Mr. White, not Mrs. Green.
Tom told me everything about it.
The neighborhood was quiet.
I appreciate your comments.
Tom thought I might be interested.
Can I talk to Mr. Johnson?
You want a fight?
Ask your sister to obey the rules.
Get out, please.

Pack up your stuff.
Tom was hiding behind the shower curtain.
You think I'm too high?
I took it, of course, for you to join.

I don't know if I have enough money.
We're about to drag your car.
Tom bled the engine but left the front lights on.
That tea's too bitter.
Tom put all his money in a box and hid it under his bed.
You don't look convincing.
It's getting worse.
We should check it out.
She never got out of the pain after the accident.
I agree with you.
That's a good reason like everyone else.
She gave him a key.

We'd love to help.
I'll have you arrested.
They don't always obey their parents.
That doesn't mean you don't have to be careful.
Follow him.
Let's see how Tom responds to this.
It smells disgusting to me.
Three quarters of the Earth's surface is covered in water.
It's my father's portrait.
It's food.
That sounds terrible.
It's amusing and shocking in the same breath.
I hear you're going to the United States.

Something's incompetent anyway.
That's a wonderful feeling.
She set up her house for sale.
Don't go anywhere, okay?
Just tell us what this is about.
We were standing in front of our guests.
I got mad.
This adoption is very juicy.

Listen to me carefully.
There's something we have to talk about.
I don't like to see animal abuse.
Tom left the brothel before Mary's funeral.
One of the greatest mystery of life is how a cat decides what his next step is.
I ate the junkie we cooked a few days ago.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom jumped into the frozen water.
Are you sure there's no way?
Tom said he couldn't walk.
I'll wait down.
Of course she's sick.
The boat's turned upside down.
Maybe we should go and see Tom.
Now come trouble.
Nobody's been up yet.
I'll remember you forever.
Tom was shocked.
I'll do your advice.
Tom bet the wrong horse.
Please explain the rejection.
Thank you for paying attention.
We've been waiting hours for you until you show up.
Tom wasn't the only one that got up so early this morning.
The road's too narrow for trucks.
We're in trouble.
How many students do you have at school?
It feels like it's the right thing to do.
Tom knows Mary's hiding something.
They all deserve to die.
I barely knew him.
Many animals that live thousands of years no longer exist.
Let's move on.
Did you guys have a nice weekend?
Am I stupid?
She was depressed because of all her problems.
Are meals at price?
Because the rain stopped. He went for a walk.
The doctor knew how to deal with this emergency.
The temperature dropped by 10 degrees.
I know this neighborhood.
She applied for a visa.
I thought it was over.
It's dangerous to swim at night.
It's just like fighting wind safety.
I don't care about the risk.
It's weather forecast time.
It looks tough.
That man's dangerous.
She cooked us a wonderful meal.
He was a soldier during the war.
I'm on the sea.
That was my first thought.
We don't blame you.
We can't live without sleep as we can't live without food.
Someone just called.
They knew better days.
He lives from hand to hand.
If you don't hurry, you'll never get to the village.
We think the reason for his success was hard work.
I'm sick of it.
It all depends on your decision.
You're thin.
He's in his mind, his hand supports his forehead.
There's not much to say.
Look, here he comes.
She was really cold.
It's on my list of assignments.
Be careful not to fall to scratch your knee.
I gave it to my mom.
Stop wasting time.
I felt pretty bad.
My hobby is reading.
I'll have my coffee after dinner.
I don't forgive you.
They don't believe you.
That wasn't supposed to happen.
I don't want to study tonight.
Tom thinks Mary made a bad mistake.
I always knew Tom was meant for greatness.
It's raining quietly.
Could you send this letter in a quick mail?
Close it.
Tom's not responsible.
Hey, guys, I'm Tom, and I'm here with Mary.
You look beautiful tonight.
We had some problems with the camouflage yesterday.
Tom visited Mary on October 20th.
When I got home, I found your letter waiting for me.
They're Russian.
It's simpler than it looks.
She looks like a real, reliable man to me.
Tom Athletic.
He tried.
We can't survive without your help.
I was the one who suggested it.
This affair isn't as good as his last novel.
They stayed this way for a while.
This path is dangerous.
Can you show me the way to the library?
I stayed home all day and read books.
That's my decision.
It's okay.
I made him go.
Ask him to come watch a movie.
Tom was a lockdown.
Don't worry. Don't worry. You know, the hand of my heart will know.
I know exactly how you feel.
I met Tom in January.
They made a joint decision about the divorce.
Stop harassing me.
Today I'm in the mood of Langenlocky.
It doesn't happen much.
We're planning on visiting Mr. Smith tomorrow.
He's got a comfortable nature.
I never want to leave this place.
My son is my biggest headache.
Sit down, please!
I can't drive the car.
She invited each of us to ice cream.
She was playing the play.
Tom told me he didn't see Mary all day.
I don't like being alone on the beach.
I never plan anything.
You got a map?
Tom was sweating.
Do I have to sell it?
They're communicating by hand signs.
Maybe we should ask someone for help.
I'm hungry.
That's hard to read.
I've been cold for a week and I haven't recovered yet.
We started walking again right after she recovered.
Is there an English-Japan hotel on the shelf?
The gun will settle.
We're too few now.
We have to stay alert.
What's the matter with Tom anyway?
They had a child.
Tom seems upset.
Maybe Tom's telling the truth.
Civilization is now a threat to nuclear war.
I often have nightmares.
The company decided to hire two new secretaryes.
Please give me a pillow.
Tom almost killed both of them.
I wanted to watch this movie with you.
Come at least six.
I'm getting out of your clue.
It's very intuitive.
I'll get it back right away.
Tom and Mary are both miserable.
What group is your boyfriend on?
We'll just stay.
Sit still, please.
Tom decided to stay behind.
Please shut up.
Do you like what you see?
Give me a second chance.
It's natural.
Don't ever write the words "mock to the mouth" and "machine soup" in German!
This is a violent neighborhood.
You'll be surprised what you can learn in a week.
There are animals that can feel the storm coming.
How can I ever forgive Tom?
This house looks abandoned.
This is the perfect place for the ambush.
Consult the doctor.
I'm jealous.
These are my friends.
She's in love with this kid.
Tom didn't finish all his homework.
How do you know about Tom?
You sound childish.
I know you'd do the same to me.
By the fall, they're getting their color up and they're breaking.
Tom never admits by mistake, because he thinks it's a sign of weakness.
That's how I like it.
She admits she didn't meet Maria.
It's the second river in its length in Japan.
No one's happy.
Finally I don't owe anyone.
Tom spoke rudely.
He's married and father to two.
Could have been a failure in the answer.
He runs his bike every week.
Don't turn the computer off.
From this distance, you can't tell.
She was instructed by her former doctor and transferred to another hospital.
I've been out of line.
My best friend speaks Irish.
It's more complicated than I thought at first.
I don't know anything about him.
I only had a few beers.
The man who's slamming the car is Mr. Jones.
I owe you my success to my friend.
I stayed calm.
She likes to try new things.
I heard him snitch.
Go to the next page.
Did you become an angel?
I hope this can happen now.
Materials will be collected.
Did I touch a hairdresser?
There are many places to spend time in big cities.
The first blow is half the battle.
I'm not sure of that either.
I've really seen a ghost.
You recovered from the shock?
Tell Tom I'm going for a ride.
It's all on your head.
Do you happen to know where she lives?
Tom and Mary are probably getting married one day.
Their house was on fire.
I love this picture.
Get a nap.
Eventually, his dream came true.
I worked very hard.
Not to be dead.
She couldn't answer the question.
The oranges are rich in vitamin C.
I'm sure Tom told you I'd be here.
This system has advantages and disadvantages.
He hid the fact that he expelled his wife.
Shut your big mouth.
Tom told Mary about his new car.
Who invented the dynamite?
You're the greatest love of my life.
Experience bearing fruit.
Where's your money?
Tom asked Mary to sing harder.
Sorry, I can't stay long.
I don't know if it's a top.
Where's the toothpaste?
Let's get something cold to drink.
It's my books.
I want a guitar like John has.
It won't bother us if you take a picture from the outside.
The goal is to sanctify the means.
You seem to have a lot of knowledge of it.
Are you from the supporters or from the opponents of humiliation?
Please don't interfere with it.
Long Time No C.
I won't get an e-mail from anyone today.
I've been waiting for you.
The cat's finished his back.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Tom is from Boston.
You want to know how I did it?
I can't find the paper.
I'm learning single languages.
This microscope increases itself a hundred times.
He's in debt.
Tom's squeaky.
Tom's not the one who left the party early.
Speaking English in Canada?
That's really impressive!
We wanted dessert.
Tom didn't get up early enough.
Hello, how can I help you?
Tom pointed his gun at the target.
I believe my friend's growing horns.
You'd better leave.
Donald Trump suffers from dementia.
Please don't ask.
I'm coming to kill you.
I like the time between the Arabs.
You have to go.
You ready to go out?
I know how that must sound.
Can anyone help me out here?
Where was Tom thrown into prison?
I learned from the best.
Don't be too quick to protect me.
I only know that.
Don't ignore me again.
Area in the building: you have to use protective helmets.
This is Tom's locker.
I'm sure I won't recommend an end to the job.
You should try not to forget what time it is.
Will you go to the United States next year?
Think about your future.
As far as I'm concerned, I don't trust him at all.
I don't know what to say.
It was raining yesterday.
She got caught with her pants down.
I know you might think I'm too young.
I can't help him.
It didn't go that far.
How does everyone feel?
We're supposed to be safe here.
Have you had breakfast today?
There's a bridge a mile up the river.
Tom asked Mary not to do that.
I know you think there's no hope.
The judges made a decision.
Is it hard to learn Greek?
He's going to the library to read books.
They're animals in this city.
The sky will be clear soon.
I didn't like Tom.
We're trying to learn here.
Please, adopt this doggy pup.
It's impossible to provide it.
Go back to your chair.
She chose a hat that would fit her new dress.
I spent the last Sunday off at home.
Let's not do anything that might upset Tom.
I'm short of money.
I'll finish reading this novel soon.
Tom doesn't seem interested in what's going on.
I don't want you to see my daughter anymore.
You guys don't go out there.
Tom drinks about three gallons of water a day.
We'll never agree.
We're glad we're alive.
Some newspapers distort the news.
Please sign this.
That's my car.
I'd love to see that.
This pen is the best.
The admiration of heroes is a dangerous matter.
Tom says he doesn't want to fight about this anymore.
The paper's white.
Drinks are half a price to six.
The sky is clear almost every day.
Well, I lied.
Whatever you do, don't come in complaints to Tom about it.
Paris is a very big witch for Japanese youth.
This bridge is three times longer than it is.
I tried not to eat too much.
Tom looks desperate.
They slept in the same bed.
His success depends on his efforts.
I've got quite a lot of hats.
The settlers built their houses along the river.
It was impossible to pull the traffic.
Today was exciting.
I stand for it.
Just the necessary repairs, please.
Salt, please.
Have you decided where to eat lunch?
I changed my theory.
She was kind enough to pick me up from the house.
I ran.
Tom's an accountant.
Raise your left hand.
I question the accuracy of his statement.
I think they've had a problem.
This movie's boring.
Where to go and what to see were my main concerns.
My longest romantic connection lasts four months.
She never told me yet.
To the end of an old velvet hat he's always wearing in the rain.
Take your stuff and go.
You just like doing bad to people, don't you?
We need a lot of people there.
You can agree or not, but I don't change the price.
We could be in danger.
Epstein didn't kill himself.
I want to speak French as a washman.

Good coffee and chocolate together.

You're an idiot!
We have enough food for everyone.
Tom was too shocked to answer.
There's something in the room that needs to be washed.
Everyone knows the moon is just a lump of yellow cheese.
We're out of cheese.
Looks like Tom's enjoying the job.

Janny agreed.
I'm reading the Koran.

Nobody said life was fair.
I hope that's not a problem.

Now, I think so, too.
I asked him to come see me.
Actually, my French isn't that good.

I'll be there on May 23.
You're taking Tom to our team?
Are you sure you didn't say that?
I played Jazz.
I played Jazz.
Who did Tom teach?
Is it safe to drink who's barfing here?
That's why Tom left.
You look like a farmer.
Tom gets along without us.
I'm reading the Koran.
We're 99%.
Tom, please hand me the salt.

Tom always eats the same thing.

Are you sure you locked the doors?
Our problem is bigger than a lack of money.
You're white like a ghost.
You know what Tom wants to buy?
I can build a house for you.
Why didn't Tom want to come?
That's where she stayed until Soviet soldiers let her go.

That book's there.
You just like to hurt people, don't you?
I like to hang out!
You need to eat more meat.
By the time I got here, everybody's already gone.
You need to obey this rule.
We're 90 percent.
You talk like it's my fault.
Nothing has changed since the early days of mankind.
Good night, Tataova.
I was hoping we'd make friends.
Now, I think so, too.
It wouldn't surprise me if it happened.
I've been cleaning the house all day.
The show's about to start.
How many pizzas did you order?
You can't argue with the facts.
We're pretty alike.
No one's having fun.
You're the light of my life.
Szepping, I love your name.
In the beginning, he created Boston and Australia.

Why didn't you call anyone?
You're not like you used to be.
Nobody said life was fair.
Please lend me 30 bucks.
I hope that's not a problem.
Here's the reason why Tom left.
Here's your receipt.
They're really scared.
He sold his soul?
It's basketball.
I'll write down the address.
