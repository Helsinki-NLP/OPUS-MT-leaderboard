You fail to work as a dae has led to serious results such as low growth, undernutrition and eventually death.
Plant resources that have been easy to access are proteins that we can get from leaves and beans, proteins de-proteins are difficult for the mains Elli Zeina to digest if they are cooked.
On the other hand, eating from animal origin (nate, white ants, eggs) is easy to digest, but it provides a large amount of protein that contains all essential amino acids.
We don’t need all the needs in our brain, it’s not necessary that we be surprised if our ancestors have a problem of protein, which they have in a way that chimpanzees do in the savannah.

Hershei's and Chees' experience was one of the important evidence that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershei and Chis used fertilizations or viruses to enter DNA by fertilizing them to germs.
They have two live trials that distinguish if it uses the DNA of the Atheroscene virus using radioactive phosphorene, and not the virus protein of the Atherosclerosis virus.
The mutations can have a range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, and the importance of the affected genetic substance, if the cells affected by the stem line cells are not.
