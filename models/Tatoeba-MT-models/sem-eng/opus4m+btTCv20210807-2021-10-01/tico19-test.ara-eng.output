The rapidly increasing cumulative number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, which confirms that although the stage varies based on the state, the COVID-19 pandemic is getting worse rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, States, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness to increase the number of COVID-19 patients who will need healthcare, in particular intensive care.
As of December 31, 2019, a range of cases of pneumonia of unknown pathology have been reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new coronavirus-related coronavirus is now referred to as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Coff-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-Coff-2 infection has been named Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that almost 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e., respiratory infections with or without symptoms, and most of them recover.
In approximately 14%, COVID-19 was exacerbated to a more severe disease that required hospitalization, while the remaining 6% had a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The death rate for patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19 was about 4%.
In this study, we assess trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 in each EU/European Economic Area (E/EA) and UK (UK) countries and compare them with those from Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/European Economic Area and UK countries with the number in Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in European Union/European Economic Area and United Kingdom
After what happened in China, KoVID-19 has increasingly spread geographically and tracked the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced Covid-19 as a pandemic.
In the number of Eurosurfilins issued on 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed European COVID-19 cases, according to WHO definition.
In the European Union/European Economic Area, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 for people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 European Union/European Economic Area and UK countries, where from December 31, 2019 to that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Access to cumulative number and cumulative rate of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the number of reported COVID-19 cases is updated in every country around the world, which is obtained from official sources only such as the Ministry of Health in countries, national and regional health bodies and the World Health Organization (WHO), every day at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess and compare the trends of COVID-19 in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom in Italy.
As a measure of the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in 14 days, and then taking into account the natural course of COVID-19, in all EU/European Economic Area and UK countries, between January 1 and March 15, 2020.
We also provided the cumulative number of reported cases from each country from March 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m., compared with the number in Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
Covid-19 trends in European Union/European Economic Area and United Kingdom
The trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases cut over a 14-day period in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom followed those in Hubei Province (China) (figure 1).
For the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom in general, the cumulative number of COVID-19 began to increase on approximately 21 February, and then increased sharply on 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was often driven by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all EU/European Economic Area and UK countries showed trends similar to the cumulative number of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared with Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
As of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom reported the total number of cases already similar to that in Italy only 3 weeks ago or less.
Our findings indicate that the number of COVID-19 reported cases is increasing rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
The observed trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is getting worse at a similar speed in all countries.
Although countries are at different stages, despite different national public health responses, and the possibility of different status definitions in different States and protocols to select patients to be tested to confirm their infection with COVID-19, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described the situation, with nearly 10% of COVID-19 patients in intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospital access and/or COVID-19 intensive care units are currently available at EU/European Economic Area level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not displayed).
However, they need to be collected in a systematic manner to complete current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010-11 study showed significant diversity in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 families per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds for intensive care and medium care per 100,000 people in 2010-11).
Modeling scenarios associated with the satisfaction of health care capacity, with estimates for each EU/European Economic Area and UK for the spread of COVID-19 cases that have entered the hospital associated with risk > 90% to exceed the capacity of the intensive care family, are available in the sixth update to assess the rapid risk of COVID-19 at the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.
Since cases that have so far been compiled in certain regions of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, hospitals and intensive care units usually serve specific regional population groups, it is preferable to provide information on cases and intensive care families at the level of the designation of regional units for statistics 2 (NT-2).
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the Covid-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
States, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare themselves for the sustainable community transition scenario of SARS-Coff-2 and increase the number of COVID-19 patients in need of healthcare, in particular intensive care, such as in the affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s rapid risk assessment, the overall proactive rapid approach is essential for delaying the spread of SARS-COV-2 with a shift from containment to mitigation approach, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals with sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a limited opportunity for countries to increase their regulatory efforts to slow the spread of SARS-COV-2 and reduce pressure on health care.
If this fails, healthcare systems in other EU/European Economic Area countries are likely to face an increase in the number of patients who need focused attention over the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-Cof-2 virus, has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
The SARS-Coff-2 virus, similar to the virus, SARS-Coff, which caused thousands of people to have SARS disease in 2003, can also move from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, Kovid-19 has a risk rate and deaths less than SARS but is more transient and impactable between older people and men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a comprehensive and timely review of the rapidly evolving topic of research.
We will address the basics related to the disease epidemic, its causes, its viral science, its diagnosis, treatment, transmission and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions still need to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate the disease that poses a threat.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unforgettable and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who have been forced to stay in their homes throughout the holiday and many weeks later due to an outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (Cof) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named by the World Health Organization (WHO) in SARS-Coff-2 on February 11, 2020, and the disease associated with COV-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and soon spread throughout the country, as well as nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients out of hospitals and more than 3,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that COVID-19 is an enemy of public number 1 and is likely to be stronger than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 research on COVID-19 has been published, including the pathology of disease viruses, its epidemics, its causes, its diagnosis and treatment, since the first report was released on January 7, 2020, which identified an isolated virus sequence through many patients.
This review aims to summarize research progress in the new subject area, which is rapidly evolving.
Whenever possible, we will seek to compare Covid-19 with another disease caused by Cove, a Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mirres, a 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far regarding the prevention of the disease and predicting its path, as well as some of the urgent questions that are still under way.
Coronaviruses were commonly considered non-fatal diseases in humans, mainly causing about 15% of the 4 common colds.
In this century, however, we faced severe disease-causing coronavirus in humans twice, i.e. SARS-Coff and Mers-Coff, which caused an outbreak of the disease originally in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and the disease soon spread to many other countries at a terrible rate of spread and mortality.
Therefore, the current Covid-19 is a third outbreak of coronavirus in human history recorded.
As shown in figure 1.1, groups with unknown pneumonia, established by Wuhan on December 31, 2019, were first reported to the Chinese National Health Committee.
Seven days later, Coronavirus was released.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the death of the first case.
In the meantime, the epidemic quickly spread to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On January 20, cases of infections were reported among health care providers, indicating the possibility of transmission of the disease from one person to another.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was closed with all public transport stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that among 41 confirmed cases of infection, only 21 patients were in direct contact with the Wuhan Seafood Market, which was considered the site of onset of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization announced the outbreak as a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease has already spread across China and around 50 other countries worldwide (figure 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final scope and seriousness of the outbreak remain to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed for COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date explanation of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-Coff-2 infected people of all age groups, but mainly infected age groups between 30 and 65.
Nearly half of the infected (47.7%) were 50 years old, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were infected under the age of 10.
SARS-COV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
Kovid-19 expanded between groups in and around Hubei mainly.
Covid-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from the start of the diagnosis.
The average nursery period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproduction number (core reproduction number) was 3.77 (the range of confidence is 95%: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted basic reproduction number was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people affected increased sharply before January 23, 2020, in line with many travels ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate among confirmed patients was 1.44% (the range of confidence is 95%: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (the range of confidence is 95%: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60), and acute pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a class of large and coated viruses containing a single-chain riboside DNA genome.
It can be divided into four species, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, and Coronavirus is known to infect humans.
The coated fork (S) of the diabetes protein is associated with its cellular futures: the enzyme converting to angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and the Bi-Bitidel Beptidase 4 (DB4) for SARS-Coff and Mers-Coff, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral Repoise DNA genome is released into the cytoplasma; after the reproduction of the viral genome, the genomic Repoise DNA is accompanied by sugar cover proteins and sperm proteins containing virions, which are then combined with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-Coff-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
It was found that SARS-COV-2 is a new type of beta-Coff with a genetic identity exceeding 99.98% among 10 samples collected from the original outbreak site, the Wuhan Seafood Market.
SARS-COV-2 is more like SARS-COV than MERS-COV.
It was revealed through the electronic micro-analysis of the transmission that SARS-COV-2 is present in very thin sections of the human airway.
Angiotensin 2 is revealed to be a future of SARS-Cof-2 as well as SARS-Cof.
However, SARS-Coff-2 protein is associated with a weaker human enzyme of angiotensin 2 than SARS-COV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-COV-2 causes less severe infections in patients than SARS-COV.
SARS-COV-2 can also form a short protein encrypted by orf3b and a cryptocurrency protein encrypted by orf8.
Orf3b in SARS-COV-2 may play a role in viral pathology and limit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any range or pattern with a known function.
On February 18, 2020, Cho et al. reported on the structure of the full length of the human enzyme converting to angiotensin 2 under the ultra-cooled e-degree of 2.9 Å in a compound with the B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They discovered that the compound, which had an open and closed structure, had been assembled to form a deformation and that the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could bind the protein S, providing evidence to identify the coronavirus and infection.
Sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-COV-2 infection.
Original host and broker host
It has been known that both SARS-Coff and Meers-Coff have been sunk from bats and transported to humans through honey cats and beauty, respectively.
By comparing the Salal Evolution of SARS-Coff-2 with other coronaviruses, the original SARS-CoV-2 host bats were considered to match the new virus by 96% with SARS-CoVZX21-like coronavirus called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the broker host that helped the virus pass the barrier between factions remains unknown, yet it has not yet been clarified.
G et al. suggested snakes as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans, which involved a similar reinstallation within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that vegetarian ants - long tongue mammals that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are a potential host of SARS-Coff-2 based on a 99% genetic similarity in coronavirus detected in fertilized fertilis and SARS-Coff-2.
However, the 1% difference spread across genomes remains a big difference; therefore, we expect conclusive results with the concrete guide (form (figure 33).
The chemical properties of SARS-Coff-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-Coff and Meers-Coff can survive in the laboratory for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature below 20 °C and humidity ranging from 40% to 50%.
SARS-COV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-COV-2 was reported to be sensitive to UV and heat at 56 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol can concentrate 75%, chlorine-containing detergents, asteic peroxy acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorohoxide, effectively inhibit the virus.
The entire human race generally lacks immunity against SARS-COV-2, so they are more likely to have a new virus.
Currently, no detailed study on SARS-Coff-2 immune response has been received.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies relating to other coronaviruses, particularly SARS-Coff, and Meers-Coff (form (figure 4)4).
In general, after a host virus is invaded, the natural immune system is identified through receptor recognition receptors (BRS), including C-type receptors similar to C, TLR-like futures, NLR-like futures, and RIG-I-like futures.
Through various pathways, the virus stimulates the emergence of inflammation factors, the maturity of the intuitive cells, and the installation of type I interferrons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the large plematic cells of viral antibodies.
However, N protein in SARS-COV can help the virus escape immune responses.
Adaptive immune response soon joins the fight against the virus.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
The CD4+ cells stimulate biocells to produce HIV-specific antibodies, and kill the CD8+ cells directly infected with the virus.
T cells produce inflammatory cytokines to help defender cells.
However, the coronavirus can reduce T cells functions by encouraging the death programmable for T cells.
Mixed immunity, including complete proteins such as C3a, C5a and antibodies, is also essential in combating viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from Mers-Coff's patient were removed.
On the other hand, the excessive reaction of the immune system generates a large number of locally free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst likelihood, failure in multiple organ functions and death.
A SARS-Coff-2 infection, initially seen in groups, is likely to affect older people with multiple diseases and pregnant women more.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions have been more likely to become infected by others.
The estimated average SARS-Cof-2 nursery period is 1-14 days, or between 3 and 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the period of custody was on average 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described above, showed that the period of custody was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on demographics 8,866.
It is very important that health authorities adjust effective quarantine time based on the most accurate period of care, thus preventing people infected but not suffering from the transmission of the virus to others.
As a common practice, people exposed to or infected with the virus are usually required to undergo quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
The fever is often the main and primary offer of COVID-19, and can be accompanied by no symptoms or other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, turns, headache, throat, nose, chest pain, feeling sick, and vomiting.
Some patients have had short breathing and/or lack of blood glucose after one week of onset.
In severe cases, the condition of patients quickly evolved to suffer from acute respiratory syndrome, antherosclerosis, metabolic acidation, and osteoarthritis.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and severe fever should be examined, even without being exposed to imaging that reveals pulmonary abnormalities, in search of the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% of fever, 76% of dry cough, 55% of shortness of breath, and 3% of diarrhea; 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
Similar results have been reported in two recent studies of a group of families and groups to which the infection was transmitted from a person who did not show symptoms.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that Mers-Coff patients also experienced fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed far more respiratory support than COVID-19 patients and were consistent with the highest MERS mortality rate from COVID-19.
diarrhea (26%) and throat inflammation (21%) were also observed in Meres patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and throat inflammation (13-25%) were the most important symptoms, and respiratory support was required for about 14%-20% of patients.
By February 14, the death rate due to COVID-19 was 2%, while confirmed cases reached 66,576 globally.
By November 2002, the death rate for SARS was 10% of the 8,096.
For Meers, the death rate was 37% of confirmed cases of 2,494, based on a demographic study conducted in June 2012.
According to a previous study, SARS-Coff-2’s basic reproduction number was 6.47 with a 95% confidence range from 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-Coff’s primary reproduction number ranged from just 2 to 4.
A comparison between SARS-Coff-2, Meers-Coff and SARS-COV in terms of their symptoms, mortality rate and basic reproduction number is shown in table 1.1.
The figures above indicate that SARS-Coff-2 has a greater capacity to spread than Mers-Coff and SARS-Coff, but less than the latter.
Therefore, the SARS-Coff-2 epidemic is much more difficult to control than the Mers-Coff and SARS-Coff epidemic.
The onset of the disease occurs in assemblies often in the same family or from the same assembly or vehicle itself, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of traveling to or staying in Wuhan or other affected areas, or of mixing people or patients over the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, it was reported that people could carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks, and cured patients who were out of hospitals could carry the virus again, sending a warning to increase quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or low number of ambient white blood cells (especially lymph cells) at the early stage.
For example, fewer lymphocytes were detected with white blood cell count < 4×109/L, including the number of cells for the < 1×109/L, and elevated levels of the Aspartate and Blood Transmitter transporter in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of liver, muscle, and myoglobin enzymes in the blood of some patients, the increase in C protein and the rate of red keratin in the blood of most patients, have increased.
In patients with severe conditions, the level of D is increased, which is due to the breakdown of fiberin in the blood, and the number of lymph cells gradually decreased.
Radiology disorders appear in most of the Covid-19 patients and are characterized by double-particle shades or a whole glass set in the lungs.
Patients sometimes have non-typical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (RRS).
When acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs, out-of-control inflammation, fluid accumulation, and up-to-date inflammation severely affects gas exchange.
The functional dysfunction of type 1 and type 2 lung cells reduces the level of surface activation and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to stretch and increases the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst radiography results of the chest and maximum extent of the disease are often compared.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the peeling of lung cells, the formation of the healinal membrane, the lycerinal lymph nodes, and the multiple nucleic cells in my lung died from the disease, in line with the pathology of viral infection and severe respiratory distress syndrome, and similar to that of patients with SARS and Meers.
The discovery of SARS-Cof-2's reusable DNA through the reaction of the sequence polymerase to the reverse copy (TBCR) as a key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false negative results rate, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations of diagnosis (which is no longer individually dependent on TBCR) began to be used in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar attitude also occurred in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiation imaging discoveries is essential and essential for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Chang Group described a protocol to use the Chirlock-based technology to detect SARS-Coff-2, which detects a piece of RFS-Cof-2 at a rate of 20 × 10-18 m/L to 200 × 10-18 m/L (10-100 copies per microlt of input) using a gasket in less than an hour without the need for accurate devices.
We hope that the new technology will be able to significantly improve sensitivity and suitability if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with newly developed coronavirus, doctors can provide mainly supportive care for Covid-19 patients, while experimenting with a variety of treatments that have been used or suggested before to treat other coronaviruses, such as SARS-Coff, Mers-Coff, and other viral diseases (table 2).
These treatments include current and potential anti-viral drugs, immune capacitors, steroids, plasma from recovering patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients has been proposed to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to develop antibodies and antiviral vaccines.
SARS-COV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first, and may also attack, to a lesser extent, other organs that issue the converting enzyme of angiotensin 2, such as the digestive system, intestines and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and failure represent the most serious threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is necessary to relieve symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, non-stranded respiratory devices and artificial breathing devices based on the severity of the disease.
Patients with acute respiratory symptoms should be supported by membrane oxygen outside the body (ECM oh), a pulmonary cardiac leave technique used to treat heart failure or life-threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining fluid balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and respiratory shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-COV-2 patients.
Sitokin storm is known to result from an excessive reaction from the immune system in SARS and Meers patients.
The cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory reactions characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFN, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, the main cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure.
Immunity is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, particularly for severe patients.
Anabolic hormones, tosilizomap, and an anti-interleukin 6 anti-inspirator body have been used to treat the Cytokin storm.
Other cytokine storm treatments include the modification of the immune reaction directed at T cells; the blockade of IFN, IL-1, andTN; the inhibition of Janus Kenaz; Plinatombab; the capt for cytokine signal 4; and the inhibitors of Heston Distilles.
Stimulated steroids and immune patients have been widely used to treat SARS to reduce inflammatory damage.
However, steroids were not more useful with severe lung injury in SARS and Covid-19 patients.
Instead, it has caused severe side symptoms, especially the loss of the immune bone, which severely affects the predictor of the disease.
However, it was recommended that short courses of steroid hormones be used at doses ranging from small to medium with caution for critical COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this report, no antiviral treatment has been confirmed.
However, it has been discovered that giving Remdesfir, a New Khovestydi counterpart, was effective with a U.S. Covid-19 patient.
Remdesfir is a new antiviral developed by Gilliad at the beginning to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg.
Later, Remdesfir also showed a potential inhibition of other viruses with single-chain riboside DNA, including the Mers and SARS virus.
Based on these viruses, the compound Geliad provided China with some experiments on individuals with SARS-Coff-2, and the results are closely monitored.
In addition, paralysitinep, interferon-alpha, Lupenavier/Ritonavier and Rebavirin were proposed as possible treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions can occur after treatment with Blobinavier/Ritonavier.
These treatments have to be carefully monitored with other medicines used with patients.
The plasma from recovered patients and the generation of antibodies
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from a disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy individuals from having the disease is a long history.
Indeed, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the factor in their blood.
Antibodys are an i.e. G. that produces biomembrane cells to fight pathogenic agents and other foreign objects, and they recognize and immediately neutralize unique molecules.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and were injected into 10 patients with serious conditions.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral loads and improved oxygenation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to present this method for widespread use before specific treatments are reached.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related defects have to be carefully taken into account.
For example, antibodies can stimulate an excessive stimulation and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is likely to be life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is large for treating patients with critical conditions.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a global epidemic.
Therefore, the isolation of biocells from recovered patients and the identification of genetic codes that decode effective antibodies, or the search for effective antibodies against the primary proteins of the virus, are more decisive and practical.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend heavily on a range of multiple components in a combination that varies according to the diagnosis of the disease based on traditional Chinese medicine theories.
Most active components remain unknown or mysterious as they are difficult to extract and check the optimal components or combinations.
Currently, because of the lack of an effective and specific cure for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become one of the important alternative treatments for patients with mild to medium symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, the effectiveness of Xu Fing G D capsules and Lian Hua King Win capsules was detected for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest rates of healing in Covid-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used traditional Chinese medicine in 87% of their patients, including Ganzo (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used traditional Chinese medicine only with about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is an almost complete comparison, with many other impact factors such as the number of patients and the severity of their cases in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, PolyChang and his business partners published a study to compare Western Medicine (WM) treatment alone with co-treatment between Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.
They found that the lengths needed to recover from body temperature, dissipation of symptoms, and hospitalization were much shorter in the group of Western medicine + traditional Chinese medicine compared to the group of Western medicine only.
The most impressive, the rate of worsening of symptoms (which ranges from mild to severe) was much lower in the treatment group in Western medicine + traditional Chinese medicine compared to the treatment group in Western medicine only (7.4% versus 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the group of Western medicine + traditional Chinese medicine compared to the group of treatment in Western medicine alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine and safety is still waiting for more well-informed experiences on larger scale and in more centres.
It will also be interesting to describe the procedure mechanism and clarify the effective ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients suspected of being infected with COVID-19 or confirmed are often very afraid of severe and even fatal disease, and people under quarantine feel bored, lonely, and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infections such as fever, lack of oxygen, cough, as well as negative effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by activated hormones, can lead to more anxiety and mental disorder.
In the first phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric diseases including permanent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, motor psychotic excitement, mental symptoms, depression, and even suicidal tendencies have been reported.
As part of the public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory mixing and quarantine can make people more concerned and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigmatization and their friends.
Therefore, mental health care must be provided to Kovid-19 patients, persons suspected of being infected with it, and people who are mixed with them, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the creation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear contacts with regular and accurate updates about the SARS-Coff-2 outbreak and plans to treat it, and the use of specialized electronic devices and applications to avoid direct mixing between each other.
Effective vaccines to cut the transmission chain of the virus from animal warehouses and people infected with infection to hosts exposed to it are essential and are often complementary to anti-virus therapy in the fight against epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-based vaccines to generate neutral, effective and long-term antibodies and/or preventive immunity against SARS-COV.
Live vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS treatment.
However, the effectiveness of these vaccines has not been identified in the live body in older adults and fatal challenge models and in preventing infection of the source animal virus before starting a clinical study.
This may be because SARS has gone away 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, cases and groups with Meers continue to appear in the Middle East and spread to other areas due to the continued presence of animal sources in epidemic areas.
Immunization strategies against Meers have been developed using an inactive virus, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and harmful protein subunits, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-Coff-2 for non-anti-resistant individuals is an urgent and urgent task to control the current ongoing epidemic.
However, overcoming the difficulty is a challenge because of the length of time (mean 18 months) needed to develop the vaccine and the dynamic changes of the coronavirus.
Covid-19, as a new disease, has just begun to show its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without any justification.
However, COVID-19, like SARS and Meers, is also associated with prevalence rates of the disease and high mortality in severe patients.
Building a model of disease outlook is therefore essential for healthcare agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-limited areas.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the disease’s pathology expectations of Covid-19 patients (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in determining the expectations for the pathology of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
The age groups, aged 30 to 65, were mainly affected by COVID-19, with 47.7% of these patients exceeding 50 years of age in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who needed more focused attention were more likely to have underlying and complications and were much older than those who did not need it (at the age of 66 versus 51), suggesting age as predictive factor for the outcomes of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-Coff-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Covid-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and irregular heart attacks.
Heart accidents were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-COV-2 can also be associated with positive phararyngeal cells with angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, which may lead to functional liver dysfunctions in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying disease are strongly related and may interfere with each other.
Unnatural laboratory results: The C (CRP) level in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury, and is suggested to be a predictive factor for the disease, response to treatment, and final recovery.
It was also proposed to link the level of C protein to the severity of COVID-19 disease and the expectations of its walk.
In addition, the high enzyme-resistant lactate hydrogen (LDH), the secretary of Aspartate (AST), the carrier enzyme of the Secretary of Alain (ALT), and the CK-ray may also help predict the result.
These enzymes appear strongly in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional signs of functional dysfunctions in the heart or liver.
Key clinical symptoms: Radiology of the chest and progress of clinical symptoms should be taken into account together with other problems to predict the results of COVID-19 and its complications.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are commonly used immune capacitors as an assistant treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since a high dose of potent hormones has been widely used in SARS patients, a lot of survivors have suffered cardiovascular membranes with life-threatening and poor quality of life.
Therefore, steroids should be used at a low dose and for a short period of time in Covid-19 patients, if necessary.
Mental stress: As indicated above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients have experienced exceptional stress; they often endure long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and have experienced the death of close family members and their sick colleagues.
It is necessary to provide psychological advice and long-term support to help those patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological features than SARS.
In addition to copying the lower respiratory tract, SARS-COV-2 can effectively replicate into the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or do not cause any symptoms at the early stage of infection, similar to other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected at an early stage or nursery period can produce a large amount of virus during daily activities, causing difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, it was considered that the transmission of SARS-Coff virus occurs when patients are in severe illness, while most of the transmissions of the virus did not occur in the early stage.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more and more difficult in terms of its control than in SARS.
Current poor efforts are being made in China, including the closing of Wuhan, surrounding cities and ongoing quarantines for almost all residents in the hope of hindering the transition of SARS-Coff-2.
Although these measures have greatly affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating a slowing of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the recession will last for 3 to 4 months.
However, some other experts do not have the same optimism.
Paul Hunter and others estimated that COVID-19, which seems to be much more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others created a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-Coff-2 could affect two-thirds of the world’s population.
The Canadian group reported that SARS-Coff-2 was detected in mid-and-surgery surveys for patients who recovered and left hospital 2 weeks ago, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become an influenza-like periodic attack.
However, promising signs have emerged in China based on the number of new declining cases, suggesting that current strategies might have been useful.
It was originally expected that Ebola would cause up to 1 million cases with half a million deaths.
However, the disease was eventually controlled by quarantine and strict isolation measures.
Like SARS-COV, SARS-COV-2 can become weaker in terms of causing infection and eventually disappear or become a less infectious virus that survives with humans.
The Covid-19 epidemic is compared with the SARS and Meers below (figure 55).
SARS-COV-2 is transmitted at a higher rate via cough or thirst, and can also be transmitted via direct contact with HIV-contaminated substances.
The virus has also been found in feces, raising a new possibility of moving from feces to mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by hospital infections, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, it is necessary to take great precautions to protect human beings, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even traffic who have contacted patients or people affected.
Wearing face masks is the first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection; using both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series No. 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent liquid drops from a potential person from passing through air or sticking to the surfaces of materials, where they can be passed on to others.
However, the N95 masks (series No. 1860s) can only be protected from inhaling small virions of between 10 and 80 nanometres, with only 5% of the ferions being able to fully penetrate; SARS-Coff-2 is similar to SARS-COV in size and is approximately 85 nanometres.
Since particles can penetrate up to five common surgical masks together, mixed healthcare providers must directly wear N95 masks (series 1860s) but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear a proper isolation arm to reduce communication with the virus more.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor at SARS-Coff-2 was injured despite wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent face shields or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended that everyone wash their hands with more clean soap than usual, try to stay at home for self-health quarantine and reduce contact with potential individuals.
Three feet is a suitable distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-Coff-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its severe similarity with SARS-COV, as reported on January 7, 2020, would have caused a state of extreme readiness in China based on its deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, the director of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan was not assured by citizens until January 19, 2020, saying that the new virus has a low rate of infection and limited human-to-human reproduction and there is no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This message severely reduced public preparedness, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and a critical time to contain the disease in its lowest range in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies may benefit from this harsh lesson and make substantial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more careful when issuing public data because every word is important to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) more sensitive and interactive with unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restricted to contain a possible epidemic in early stages rather than attempting to reassure the public; (4) more effective training to increase public awareness of epidemiological diseases and test and improve the response system of society periodically.
The outbreak of the new SARS-Coff-2 began at the end of December 2019.
It has spread in less than two months across China and around 50 other countries globally at the time of writing this legend.
Since the virus is largely similar to SARS-Coff and also similar symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a sense of novelty for SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between Kovid-19 and SARS, which are necessary to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals than young people and men more than women, and the mortality rate is also higher in older adults than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than Covid-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Covid-19 patients even carry the virus without symptoms, while SARS patients usually do this when they are severely ill, causing greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-COV-2 spread much faster and wider than SARS-COV.
The normal Rhebosis DNA test for SARS-Coff-2 can be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, patients with the virus can become infected again.
These results significantly increase the risk of spread of the virus.
With this rapid progress in research on Kovid-19, there are still many critical issues that need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-Coff-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic similarity between SARS-COF-2 and SARS-like coronavirus is found in bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-COF-2 comes from bats.
What animal was the intermediate type that transmits the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, we cannot stop the transition efficiently, and the outbreak can return at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemistry tests have shown that SARS-COV-2 is associated with angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and cause subsequent satisfactory changes?
Is the virus also associated with the secreted cells of the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot make a quick, accurate diagnosis and provide effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic continue?
How does the virus develop genetically as it moves between humans?
Will it become a world-class rash, or will it fade like SARS, or will it come back periodically like flu?
It is necessary but may take some time to look for answers to the above and many other questions.
However, at what price it may require, we have no other option but to stop the epidemic as soon as it is and bring our lives back to normal.
Animal assets of Human Coronavirus
The mutation and adaptation lead to the joint development of coronavirus (Coronavirus) and its hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two types of human coronavirus (human coronavirus) were known to cause a mild disease, such as anemia.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MIRS) has shown the other face to reveal how dangerous and life-threatening the infection can be.
The appearance of SARS COF-2 in central China at the end of 2019 brought the coronavirus back to light, and we were surprised at its rapid spread but with the ability to cause the disease compared to his brother SARS-COV.
Human coronavirus is an established animal disease, so our understanding of the animal origin of human coronavirus would serve us well.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats where they were non-infectious.
The intermediate hosts of some human coronavirus have also been identified.
The identification of host animals has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Discovering the interactive relationships between coronavirus and host in animals also provides an important insight into the emergence of coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the information available on the seven coronaviruses, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their animal origins and interspecies transmission.
Most importantly, we compare and produce different human coronavirus from the perspective of the development of the virus and the reinstallation of the genome.
In this context, the disease caused by the current Coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed.
In addition, it also highlights the successful replacement requirements of the host and the impact of the complications of the development of the virus on the severity of the disease.
Coronaviruses belong to the family of coronavirus viruses, which includes a group of coated viruses with single-chain riboside DNA.
These viruses contain the largest genome among viral viruses with a repossic DNA of 26 to 32 kilobases and are called coronaviruses, because their composition resembles a crown under an electronic microscope.
In terms of compositional characteristics, coronavirus contains undivided genomes that share a similar organization.
Nearly two-thirds of the genome contains an open reading template (ORF1a and ORF1b), which turn into the multiple protein types pp1a and pp1ab.
Multiple proteins are further treated to generate 16 unstructured proteins, referred to as nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains open reading templates for structural proteins, including Spike (S), Cover (E), membrane (M) and nuclear protein (N).
Different strains of coronavirus also encrypt a number of additional proteins from private strains.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, Coronavirus is classified into four types (Coronavirus alpha, Coronavirus beta, Coronavirus gamma, and Coronavirus Delta), including the coronavirus types that include most of the human coronavirus and are divided into four strains (A, B, C, and D).
Evidence of genetic evolution has shown that bats and rodents act as a genetic origin for most coronaviruses alpha and Coronavirus beta, while birds are the main warehouse of Coronavirus Jama and Corona delta viruses.
Over thousands of years, coronaviruses have consistently crossed species barriers and some have emerged as causes of serious human diseases.
Seven human coronaviruses (human coronavirus) are known so far.
Among them human coronavirus-229E and human coronavirus-NL63 are alpha coronavirus.
The other five coronaviruses include human coronavirus-OC43, human coronavirus-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Coff), Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MIRS-COV), and SARS COV-2.
Human coronavirus-229E, human coronavirus-OC43, human coronavirus-HKU1 and human coronavirus-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as clumps, diarrhea or both.
In contrast, newly identified SARS-COV, MERS-COV and SARS COV-2 are all highly infectious, causing severe infection of the lower respiratory tract to a greater number of patients with a higher probability of acute respiratory distress syndrome (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and non-pregnant symptoms.
Coronavirus-229E, the first B814 strain, was removed from the nasal discharges of patients with anemia in the mid-1960s.
Much information has been collected since then through intensive studies of Human Coronavirus-229E and Human Coronavirus-OC43, which automatically heals their symptoms.
In fact, it was generally recognized that the infection of human coronavirus is harmless until SARS is spread.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is among the most deadly epidemics in our current history, with 8,000 people with approximately 10% deaths.
Ten years later, the Middle East’s respiratory syndrome (Mirres) has emerged as a constant epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula with a split spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 Human Coronavirus (the newest human coronavirus-2019), which was renamed SARS COV-2, is the current epidemic agent for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people on March 3, 2020.
The alarm bell and the world are preparing to face the upcoming SARS Coff-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have animal origins from bats, mice, or pets.
Multiple evidence supports that the evolutionary origins of all human coronaviruses from bats, where viruses are well adapted and disease-friendly but show significant genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has raised enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the world.
The tracking of animal origins of human coronavirus has shown a framework for understanding natural history, driving force and restrictive factors for interspecies movement.
This may also guide or facilitate the search for a warehouse, a medium host, and a large host animal for SARS Cof-2, with important implications to prevent future repercussions.
In this review we provide an overview of animal assets, interspecies transmission, and cause human coronavirus diseases.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common belief that the original viruses of human coronavirus are usually non-disadvantages in its natural host but become a cause of disease after moving between species to a new host.
We also review the assessment of the human coronavirus pathology, where the increase in transmissionability is often accompanied by a decrease in disease severity.
In this context, we also discuss the results of the current SARS Cof-2 outbreak.
Coronavirus has been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of the Human Coronavirus-229E was first isolated from the nasal discharges of patients with anemia, different types of coronavirus have been removed from a variety of infected animals, including the romi Dick, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dog.
In recent decades, seven types of coronavirus have been identified.
The presentation of a summary of the history of the discovery of the human coronavirus in the time order (table 1) will be educational and indicative.
The first human coronavirus strain-229E was removed from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory infections in 1966, and then adapted to life in the WI-38 lung cells.
Patients with human coronavirus-229E suffer from common symptoms, including headache, thirst, sneezing, throat inflammation, fever, and osteoarthritis in approximately 10~20% of cases.
Later in 1967, the Human Coronavirus-OC43 was removed from the organ farm and was the subsequent transfer in the brains of the infant mice.
Clinical features of human coronavirus-OC43 appear to be similar to those caused by human coronavirus-229E, which cannot be distinguished by symptoms of other respiratory infections such as flu A and nasal viruses.
Coronavirus-229E and Human Coronavirus-OC43 have spread globally, mostly tend to move during the winter season in the temperate climate.
In general, the time of breast-feeding these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a sense of disease for almost two weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, the infection of healthy individuals with the Human Corona-229E virus has caused a slight leap.
Only a few patients with HIV have shown a severe injury to the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as non-typical pneumonia, is the first human coronavirus outbreak to be well documented in human history, the cause of which is SARS-COV, the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first case of SARS was due to late 2002 in Guangdong Province of China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 confirmed injuries and 774 deaths, and spread across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the infection carrier, it was estimated that one infection could result in approximately two secondary cases, with a period of 4 to 7 days of nursery and the peak viral load on the 10th day of the disease.
The appearance of SARS-COV symptoms begins with muscle pain, headache, fever, fatigue, and hair loss, and follows them as late symptoms, difficulty breathing, and difficulty breathing.
The lack of lymphocytes, liver dysfunction, and rise of creatinine are common laboratory imbalances for SARS.
In patients with SARS, there is also a widespread senkhia, the proliferation of apparent cells, and an increase in the number of malignant cells.
About 20-30% of patients then need focused attention and artificial breath.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, in severe cases many organs, including the digestive system, liver and kidney, can also be infected and usually accompanied by a cytokine storm that may be particularly lethal in patients with HIV.
The virus was first removed from an open lung osteoarthritis for one of the relatives of the first case that travelled from Guanzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to research on the human coronavirus.
The Human Coronavirus-NL63 was removed from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be common in young children, older people and patients with respiratory diseases.
Aging, sneezing, fever, and cataractitis are common symptoms of the disease caused by the Human Coronavirus (NL63).
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a sample of the nose of an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Despite being discovered in the Netherlands, it is worldwide.
The Human Coronavirus-NL63 is estimated to be responsible for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and is the peak during early summer, spring and winter.
Human coronavirus-NL63 is associated with anesthetic laryngitis, also known as suffocation.
In the same year, the Human Coronavirus-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized for pneumonia and gastritis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia acquired from society and gastritis, human coronavirus-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with the worsening of acute asthma episodes.
Human coronavirus-HKU1 has been found to be worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases, similar to human coronavirus-NL63, human coronavirus-229E and human coronavirus-OC43.
All four human coronaviruses have adapted well to humans and in general the possibility of developing diseases with low prevalence rates, but the incident has occurred for unknown reasons as in the rarest case of the most severe human coronavirus-NL63 subspecies, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.
In general, when the coronavirus acquires this ability to move efficiently and maintain itself continuously within humans, it also becomes less damaging or sick.
Meers-Coff was first removed in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient’s lung with pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most confirmed cases are laboratory sourced from the Middle East, in many European countries and Tunisia there have been reports of cases that have been brought from abroad and a rare secondary transition to close personal contact.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, resulting in 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical symptoms caused by SARS resemble symptoms caused by SARS, characterized by acute worsening pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many people with MERS have also experienced severe renal failure, which Meres is characterized by other diseases caused by the human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
On February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed laboratory cases were reported with a high 34.4% mortality rate, making Meers-Coff one of the most known devastating viruses of humans.
From mid-December to late 2019, groups of pneumonia patients were later detected as a result of the virus of SARS Coff-2 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the current outbreak of the lower respiratory tract infection due to the SARS Cof-2 virus as an emergency of international importance to public health as called the COVID-19.
On March 3, 2020, 90,053 deaths were confirmed worldwide and the initial mortality rate was 3.4 percent.
It is worth noting that the death rate in China’s Hubei region is 4.2%, while it is outside 1.2%.
SARS Coff-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV, and appears in the form of fever, energy and shortness of breath.
Diabetes also appears in some people.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly develop to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-Coff and SARS Cof-2 are very similar due to the large homogeneity of the nucleotide sequence by 82%, they belong to different branches in the tree of the evolution of strains.
SARS COF-2 seems less severe but more contagious than SARS-COV and Mers-Kof.
It has been reported that people who do not show symptoms have been infected with SARS Cof-2 and may contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
The comparison and contrast between SARS COF-2 and the other six human coronavirus has revealed similarities and differences of great importance.
First, the coronavirus is similar to human coronavirus in the nursery period and the time period of the disease.
In this regard, SARS Coff-2 follows the general direction of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of Covid-19 infection among SARS-COV and the four human coronaviruses acquired from society (i.e. Human Coronavirus-229E, Human Coronavirus-OC43, Human Coronavirus-HKU1 and Human Coronavirus-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS Coff-2 is more common in cases of human coronavirus acquired from the community, including non-specific, minor or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases can also be seen as in the case of SARS-COV, although the percentage is slightly lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS COV-2 shows interesting patterns of both the human coronavirus acquired from society and SARS-COV.
On the one hand, the transmissionability of SARS Cof-2 is at least as high as the transmissionability of human coronavirus acquired from society.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissionability of SARS Cof-2 decreases after human transmission as in the case of SARS-Coff and Mers-Coff.
Finally, SARS Cof-2 can be detected in feces samples as in other human coronaviruses.
Further studies are still needed in the future to clarify whether the transition of SARS Coff-2 from the oral anal path plays an important role as in the case of SARS-COV at least in some cases.
It is interesting whether SARS Cof-2 may show seasonal spread as in cases of human coronavirus acquired from society.
However, the features of SARS Cof-2, including the possibility of transition, the mechanism of disease and sustainable post-transition spread, will have an impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four human coronaviruses acquired from society causing mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
There is another perspective, which may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, they may both be survivors of the old human coronavirus pandemic.
Human coronaviruses with severe diseases have been eliminated as well as those with acute human coronavirus disease.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must reproduce enough in humans to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations faced by the hosts.
From this logic, the longer the SARS COF-2 outbreak continues and the more people infected, the greater the chance of its full adaptation to humans.
If it adapts well, it is difficult to stop its transmission between humans through quarantine or other infection control measures.
The four coronaviruses acquired from society have spread among human populations over many years, causing absconding in good people.
These viruses do not need an animal warehouse.
On the contrary, SARS-Coff and Meers-Coff, causing severe disease with humans, were not well adapted, and we were unable to continue moving between humans.
They need to stay in and reproduce in their animal warehouses and then look for the right opportunity to move to the most vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate and amplify host.
SARS COF-2 is similar to SARS-COF/MIRS-COF and the four human coronaviruses acquired from society.
It is very hostile like the human coronavirus acquired from society, at least at the moment.
However, it causes more disease than human coronavirus acquired from society and less than SARS-Coff or Mers-Coff.
It is not yet clear whether or not it will fully adapt to humans and spread between them without the need for a warehouse or an animal host.
Before discussing the animal assets of the human coronavirus, it will be useful for us to review the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, warehouse, intermediate and amplifier coronavirus.
The animal plays the evolutionary host role of the human coronavirus if it shelters the virus of its closely related origin and shares a great deal with the level of nucleotide sequences.
The original virus is usually well adapted and undetectable to this host.
Similarly, the host shelters the human coronavirus continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and natural hosts of the human coronavirus or their father virus.
On the contrary, if the human coronavirus enters the newly developed host before or near its attack on humans, it does not adapt well to the new host and is often caused by disease.
This host can act as an animal source of human infection and also play an enormous host role by allowing the virus to be temporarily copied and thus transferred to humans to expand the infection among humans.
Human coronavirus infection may reach a dead end if the virus fails to move from within the intermediate host.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the broker host so they may settle it for a long time.
In this case, the broker host becomes the host of the natural warehouse.
Epidemiology data later revealed that the first case of SARS had a history of contact with steroids.
Muslim proliferation surveys later indicated that animal traders had high anti-SARS-COV prevalence rates compared to ordinary people.
For the first time, paguma larvata and Rifon dogs in live animal sales have viruses similar to SARS-Coff that are almost identical to SARS-Coff.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no other case of SARS was reported after all dairy cats were killed in the markets.
However, it has been reported that the result of the SARS-Coff examination in Zabad of the compelling palm that lives in the wild or farms without being exposed to live animal markets was largely negative, indicating that the convinced palm cavities may only be a mega host but not the natural warehouse of SARS-Coff.
Noting that as 80% of the different animals in Guanzo’s markets have anti-SARS-Coff antibodies, the possibility that multiple types of small mammals also play the role of the massive host of SARS-Coff is not excluded.
They all seem to be hosts who don't carry SARS-Coff.
The search for the animal natural host of SARS-Coff later revealed that closely associated bat coronavirus, called HKU3-related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (HKU3-related acute respiratory syndrome), is found in Chinese horse-toothy bats.
The result of the screening of the anti-SARS-Coff antibodies in these bats and the sequence of the HKU3 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus was positive.
The virus and other coronaviruses of bats share 88-92% nucleotide sequences with SARS-COV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are host to emerging human pathogens.
Many coronavirus-like coronaviruses have been identified from bats, but none of them have been isolated as live virus except WIV1.
Angiotensin 2 convert enzyme (Agiotensin2 convert enzyme) is known as the receptor of SARS-COV.
WIV1 derived from a fecal fecal fecal sample was shown to have been using the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme in bats, dairy cats, and humans as a recipient of cell entry.
Interestingly, the recuperator’s serum of severe acute respiratory syndrome had the ability to equation WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most closely related virus to SARS-COV in bats, as they share 95% nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high similarity between these two viruses, WIV1 is generally believed to be not SARS-Coff direct father virus and bats are not a direct host of SARS-Coff.
Analysis of the evolution of Mers-Coff strains in the Corona-HKU4 virus group in bats and coronavirus-HKU5 is combined in the bats themselves.
The Corona-HKU4 virus is used in the same host bat and Mers-Coff as the host, bilateral with Peptidyl Peptidase4 (Beptidyl Peptidase4), to enter the virus.
Polymerise-based Repozy DNA sequences for Meres-Coff are closer to the evolution of strains to its counterparts from the coronavirus beta in bats identified in Europe and Africa.
It has not yet been discovered that Mers-Coff lives in wild bats.
Mers-Coff and Corona-HKU25 are involved in its closest bats in the same nucleotide sequences as only 87%.
Thus, host bats may not be the direct warehouse of Mers-Coff.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that only fine sleep is positive for Mers-Coff’s anti-equivalences, as well as beauty of Middle East origin in many African countries.
Mers-Coff is removed from the only-year-old camels' nasal scans, noting that camels play the role of the original host of Meers-Coff.
It is also worth noting that minor symptoms generally appeared in camels that were experimentally infected with Meers-Coff, but that intense viral outbreaks were observed.
The affected camels were noticeably spread not only by breathing but also through the oral route, which is the primary route for the spread of the virus from bats.
However, there are still questions because many confirmed cases of Meers have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, and these are attributed in terms of logic to human-to-human transitions or anonymous methods of transmission involving species of animals that have not been identified as sheltering Meers-Coff.
RaTG13 Coronavirus SARS Coff-2 participates in bats isolated from horse bats in the nucleotide-like of 96.2%.
The contrast between SARS COF-2 and RaTG13 is so long that it is difficult to determine the relationship with the father, as in the cases of SARS-COF and MERS-COF.
This means bats may not be the host(s) direct warehouse for SARS Cof-2 unless Coronavirus for bats is found almost identical in the future.
The intermediate host animals of SARS Cof-2 are supposed to be among the species sold and killed in the Wuhan Seafood Market, to which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 have been associated, indicating the likelihood of an animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on the metagen sequence suggested that a range of endangered small mammals known as Manis javanica can also house the original coronaviruses of SARS Coff-2.
The new Coronavirus genomes for these ants and SARS Cof-2 share 85-92% nucleotide sequences.
However, they are closely linked to RaTG13, which is about 90% similar to the level of nucleotide sequences.
Two sub-salts of SARS Cof-2-like viruses gather in the tree of the evolution of strains, one of which shares a similar relationship with SARS Cof-2, with 97.4% matching amino acid sequences.
In stark contrast, SARS Coff-2 receptor bonding areas differ significantly from RaTG13, although the entire genome sequence is higher.
A previous study of a patient’s anaesthetic sperm eating revealed that viral organisms from samples of the lung were present, and it was found to be similarly associated with SARS Cof-2.
This study adopted different assembly methods and manual processing to generate a partial genome sequence consisting of a full-length viral genome of approximately 86.3%.
We can't rule out the possibility that an anaesthetic ants eat is one of the intermediate host animals of SARS Coff-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that fertilization of fertilized ants is the direct origin of SARS Cof-2 due to the variation of sequences between SARS Coff-2 and the coronavirus Bita associated with SARS Cof-2 in the fertilized fertilized ants.
In addition, the distance between SARS COF-2 and RaTG13 is lower than the distance between SARS COF-2 and the coronaviruses associated with SARS COF-2 in the osteoarthritis.
The evolutionary path of SARS COF-2 in bats, fertilized ants, and other mammals are still under appointment.
While the highest sequence similarity has been found in the areas of receptor association between SARS COF-2 and fertilization, Corona beta-related coronaviruses associated with SARS COF-2, SARS COF-2 and RaTG13 share the highest similarity to the complete genome sequence.
It is often speculating that the high degree of similarity between the areas of connection between SARS Cof-2’s receptors in the fish of the coronavirus coronavirus Beta and SARS Cof-2 are critical of selective convergence.
There is a counterproposal that is likely to be re-installed between SARS Cof-2 in anaesthetic ants food belonging to Coronavirus and RaTG13 in third wild species.
The re-installation is widespread among Corona beta viruses as a driving force for development.
The direct animal origin of SARS Cof-2 has not yet been confirmed.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronavirus, human coronavirus-229E, Human Coronavirus-OC43, Human Coronavirus-NL63 and Human Coronavirus-HKU1 have also been studied.
Evidence of the evolution of strains has shown that both human coronavirus-NL63 and human coronavirus-229E may have emerged from coronavirus viruses, while the virus has been found for human coronavirus-OC43 and human coronavirus-HKU1 in rodents.
Coronavirus in bats, called ARCoV.2 (Plash height coronavirus) detected in North American tricolor bats, was reported to be closely related to Human Coronavirus (NL63).
On the other hand, the Human Coronavirus-229E was found to be genetically associated with another coronavirus in bats, called Hiposideros/ GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, and it was suspected that the amphibians were also its intermediate host.
To clarify, current information on the animal assets of the human coronavirus known as Figure 1 and Table 2 has been summarized.
Analysis of the evolution of strains provided evidence of human coronavirus transmissions between species across history.
When human coronavirus-OC43 crossed species of domestic livestock infection around 1890, the respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of human coronavirus-229E transmission between species remains less clear.
Coronavirus alpha in bats has been found to be closely related to human coronavirus-229E.
Among them are the alpha coronavirus in Alba.
Many evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans, not alpaca, may have contact with bats in a common environmental home.
Humans have a close connection to Alba.
Second, the Human Coronavirus-229E-related coronavirus alpha virus in bats is multiple and non-infectious in bats, while the alpha coronavirus in alpaca causes respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-related Coronavirus has not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that alpaca was infected with human coronavirus-229E cannot be excluded from the alpha coronavirus.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause diseases to humans including dog disease, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
So it's not surprising that bats may transmit the human coronavirus-229E directly to humans.
While alpha coronavirus in bats plays the role of gathering the genes of the Human Coronavirus-229E, the only alpaca and camels may act as hosts for the transmission of viruses to humans, just like in Mers-Coff.
Mers-Coff gives an excellent example of the transition between species, it moves from bats to single camels and from single camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of Mers-Coff from bats has been known since the beginning of recognition and has also been strengthened through subsequent results.
It’s clear that bats provide a rich pool of viruses to exchange genetic pieces within one species and move them between species.
The bats have a lifetime, live in crowded colonies, close social interaction, and the strong ability to fly all of them are favourable conditions to make them a perfect virus distributor.
Meers-Coff, on the other hand, moved to the only beautiful sleep for decades.
You may adapt to these beautys well until you are transformed from a broker host to a natural and stable warehouse host.
Mers-Coff causes a very small disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its intermittent movement to humans remains such as coincidence and man is a non-transporter host for Meers-Coff where it cannot continue.
Unlike the role of beauty in the transport of Mers-Coff, the role of fertilized ants, if any, in the transition of SARS Coff-2 is different.
In particular, the coronavirus beta associated with anaesthetic ants’ food has a severe disease.
They may be non-transporter hosts for SARS Cof-2 that belong to Coronavirus Bita, similar to a cat in the case of SARS-Coff.
Future studies will resolve many possibilities of moving SARS Cof-2 between animal species to humans either by proving or excluding them.
First, bats may be the host of a virus warehouse associated with SARS Cof-2, which is often identical to SARS Cof-2.
Humans and bats may share their home environment through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, anaesthetic ants can be one of the recently discovered massive hostages of the virus associated with SARS Coff-2.
Human beings are infected with the virus by slaughter and consumption of sandwich meat.
Many mammals, including pets, are likely to be susceptible to SARS Coff-2.
A survey of antibodies in pets and wild animals is justified.
Third, as mentioned above, there may have been a reinstallation and adaptation of SARS Cof-2 in a third type that has a connection to bats and anaesthetic ants.
The search for the animal origin of SARS Coff-2 is still under way.
Regardless of the different types of animal hosts, it is viral side that there are three main factors and is also important to facilitate infection with coronavirus to overcome barriers to species.
First, the rate of mutation is relatively high in the doubling of the rebose DNA.
The estimated rates of coronavirus outbreaks, compared to other single-chain RF viruses, can be considered - medium - or high - with an average conversion rate of ~10-4 cases per year to site 2, depending on the stage of adaptation of the coronavirus to the new host.
Coronaviruses include a corrective external rebound enzyme, which leads to a very high convertibility and detachment or inability to develop.
Interestingly, the drug Remdesfir for nucleotides is known for its ability to replicate the coronavirus through inhibition of the external reionoclaze enzyme and the reusable reusable DNA polymerase.
Remdesfir is one of the anti-SARS Cof-2 virology agents that is scheduled to be tested in clinical trials.
However, coronavirus mutation rates are about 1 million times higher than host rates.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when coronaviruses do not adapt appropriately to the host.
The rate of mutation of SARS Cof-2 is significantly low when compared with high-voltage SARS-Cof, which indicates a higher level of human adaptation.
It seems that it has already adapted to another host close to man.
In addition to SARS Coff-2, this also applies to Meers-Coff, which adapts well to the only sleeping camels.
In theory, genetic deviation of vaccines and antivirus drugs is unlikely to help resist SARS Cof-2 to weaken its effectiveness quickly.
Second, the massive rebose DNA genome in coronavirus actively provides an additional donation in the modification of the genome for mutations and re-installation, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies development, which is beneficial for the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions become appropriate.
This is supported by the unique abundant open reading templates and encrypted protein functions near the end of the 3D genome.
Third, Coronavirus is changing the templates randomly and frequently during the reproduction of rebose DNA through the unique mechanism of copy selection.
In a host that is like a mixed bowl, the sequence switch occurs frequently during the reusable DNA versions of the Coronavirus.
High-threat and secondary genomic DNAs may reinstall to generate new coronaviruses.
Evidence has been found for the evolution of strains of natural recombination in human coronavirus-HKU1 and human coronavirus-OC43, as well as animal coronaviruses as in coronavirus-like acute respiratory syndrome in bats and coronavirus-HKU9 in bats.
The virus interacts with the host associated with the transmission
In addition to the above three viral factors, viral interaction with the host host is another major factor that affects interspecies transmission.
In this regard, we are addressing the re-installation of SARS-Coff as a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transitions.
Based on the comparative analysis between samples isolated from SARS-Coff in man and the pig, it was believed that SARS-Coff was subject to rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly through mutations occurring in the field of receptor-relationship of Protein S.
In general, the field of receptor-sparing interaction of the coronavirus protein interacts with the cellular receptor and is selected intensively through the host’s response.
In SARS-COV, the area of attachment in amino acids occurs from 318 to 510 in S1, which is associated with the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme as well as the assisted receivers to enter the virus.
The field of interaction in SARS-Coff is able to identify the receptor recipients of angiotensin 2 to help with different animals, including bats, dairy cats, mice, and raccoon dogs, allowing for the transmission of the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acids were found that were different from viral isolated samples from humans and dairy cats in the field of future binding, and 4 of which are present in a future link sequence to interact with the receptor converting enzyme of angiotensin 2.
The K479N and S487T mutations are in the field of SARS-Coff’s future bonding in the pig cat, which can increase the likelihood of the interaction of Spike protein in the host enzyme converting to human angiotensin 2.
In other words, these two types of amino acids may be critical to viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS Coff-2 shares the same cell receptor in SARS-COV.
There is a 30% difference between SARS COF-2 and SARS-COV in the S1 unit of protein S, which implies that the probability of protein S bonding in human angiotensin 2 converting enzyme has changed.
Indeed, a study in the super-cooled electronic microdegenerator indicated that there was a 10- to 20-fold higher probability of this association compared to that of the human angiotensin 2 converting enzyme and the SARS-Coff protein.
It’s also interesting to determine whether any other type of assistance recipients may be necessary for the transition of SARS Cof-2.
It is also interesting that human coronavirus-NL63 is also associated with angiotensin 2 converting enzyme but in a different part of the protein S.
There are many other human coronavirus recipients, such as the protein analyzer Coronavirus Human Corona-229E, and the 9-O-replaced sialic acid of the Human Coronavirus-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronavirus viruses in humans after moving between species of their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of human coronaviruses is also subject to other factors of reliability and limitations in host.
The complexation of these host proteins between humans and hosts of natural coronavirus warehouses, such as bats, single camels, and rodents, could be an obstacle to interspecies transmission.
Human coronaviruses need to control host dependency factors and weaken their restriction factors to implement a successful interspecies transition.
In this regard, molecular criteria in this important area of virus interaction with host remain identifiable and characteristics determined.
An unbiased large-scale examination of the genome can be used to look at the credit factors and host limitations of SARS Cof-2 using the advanced chrysper technology.
The emergence of emerging human coronavirus: Back to the starting point
The diversity of coronaviruses in bats provides abundant opportunities for the emergence of new human coronavirus.
From this logic, Coronavirus in bats is a genetic compound of human coronavirus.
In addition, the rapid mutation and gene re-installation also drive the development of the human coronavirus and represent two important points in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein encryption genes involves the ability to significantly modify viral phenomena.
Among the regulatory proteins of SARS-Coff, ORF8 was believed to be important in adapting to humans, where SARS-COV associated with viruses were isolated in bats but found to be cryptocurrency different ORF8 proteins.
It was found that the 29 properties of SARS-Coff's nucleotide were present in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion has led to the division of ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be a mutation of how to enhance host switching.
In addition, SARS-COV has a history of possible re-installation through alpha and gamma coronavirus strains, where a large number of small re-installation areas have been identified in re-installing DNA-based re-installing polymerase.
Reinstalling sites were also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
In a similar way, research has shown that the Mers-Coff epidemic has seen recombinations between different breeds, which occurred in the only sleeping camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-Coff and Mers-Coff, re-installation has also occurred in other human coronaviruses, where human coronaviruses with other coronavirus have been detected in their non-building genes.
It should be noted that artificial selection can also help to unintended changes in the viral genome, most of which result from the removal of viruses from selective pressures, such as what happens by the host immune system.
Loss of ORF4 protein full-length in the human coronavirus-229E virology strain due to the deletion of two nucleotides is an example of these effects.
Although proper ORF4 can be observed in camels and bat viruses associated with the Human Corona-229E virus, the alpha coronavirus, which infects the Alpaca, is one nucleotide, which leads to the spread of the pattern frame.
Last but not least, the development of new coronavirus also pushes selective pressure in its warehouse host.
Unattached cases of mild or mild symptoms have been detected only when bats infected with coronavirus, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It showed that bats adapted appropriately to physiconic and physiological coronavirus.
For example, poor activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats has reduced the effectiveness of the pathogens that have been induced by the coronavirus.
In addition, normal killer cell activity in bats was observed due to an increased rate of natural killer cell receptor inhibition NKG2/CD94 and a low level of expression of major tissue compatibility compound molecules category I.
Moreover, the high level of types of interactive oxygen compounds (types of interactive oxygen compounds) resulting from high metabolic activity of the bats can lead to both the coronavirus reproduction and the effect of correction by external reiononuclease enzyme, thus providing selective pressure to create strains of the virus that are highly infectious when a new host is infected.
Additional disease-causing strains of the coronavirus may arise by reinstalling, resulting in the acquisition of new protein or protein properties to adapt to the host.
Accordingly, it is no coincidence that three novel human coronavirus have emerged over the past two decades.
Coronaviruses do not cause disease or cause mild symptoms in stored hosts such as bats and camels.
They are highly copied without sparking a strong immune response from the host.
Here are the secrets that explain why virus carriers who do not show signs of symptoms and causes of severe cases are seen in human infection.
The acute symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivity and cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in the case of unasymptomatic carriers, the immune response is separated from the reproduction of the coronavirus.
A similar immune response separation strategy may have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS Cof-2.
Interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, taking type I interferon can be used at least in the first stage of the infection with SARS Cof-2 in humans.
In addition, the activation of the inflammatory particle Cributyrin NLRP3 in bats is weak.
In this mental sense, inhibition of the inflammatory particle of NLRP3 with the MCC950 inhibitor is useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS Coff-2 follows the general idea of SARS-COV and Mers-Kof.
While it was found that the Corona beta virus in bats involved SARS-COV in nucleotide homogenization by 95%, there was also Coronavirus in bats sharing 96% of nucleotide homogenization with SARS Cov-2.
While honey cats and other animals in the markets were found to contain viruses similar to SARS-Coff, they did not detect the direct and intermediate hosts of SARS Coff-2.
Coronaviruses have been detected in an anaesthetic ants eating, which are very closely aligned with SARS Cof-2, suggesting that anaesthetic ants may be one of the intermediate host(s) or that the beta coronavirus in fertilized fertilized fertilized fertilis, which has led to the final version of SARS Cof-2.
Although the questions are still being asked, there is no evidence that man-made SARS Coff-2 is not deliberately or by accident.
Coronaviruses have returned to focus due to the recent outbreak of SARS Coff-2.
The study of coronavirus in bats and other animals has significantly changed our idea of the importance of the origins of animal diseases and animal warehouses of human coronavirus in human transmission.
The intimate evidence has shown that SARS-Coff, Mers-Coff and SARS Cov-2 all originated from its origin into the bat and moved to man through intermediate hostages.
Based on the fact that SARS-Coff infection arose from contact between humans and dairy cats in the markets, closing fresh product markets and killing dairy cats were supposed to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
In the same mental sense, the animal should be removed from the market for fresh products to prevent the transmission of the disease of origin, in light of the discovery of multiple strains of coronaviruses in the melanomas, which are very close to SARS COV-2.
However, whether or not SARS Coff-2 has moved to humans, as well as whatever its method of transmission, through the animals of fertilized ants and other mammals remains a subject that needs to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, Merce-Coff was found in the only beautiful sleep for a long time.
Such beauty is an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for local citizens.
It is widely spread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
So it’s impossible to sacrifice all the beauty to control Meers, as officials in China’s wildlife markets have done to prevent the spread of SARS-Coff and SARS-Coff-2.
To stop the frequent outbreaks of Merse, a comprehensive approach to the development of effective anti-Meers-Coff vaccines should be followed, as well as other measures to combat infection.
To finally eliminate these viruses, new genetic patterns may arise and cause outbreaks.
There is a variety of coronaviruses associated with animal diseases originating in wildlife.
In particular, coronaviruses are highly diverse in bats that involve the likelihood of causing animal origin diseases.
There are many opportunities to create and reinstall coronavirus related viruses associated with animal origins, resulting in new coronaviruses that are more mobile and/or deadly in humans in the future.
A culture of wild animal eating should be abandoned in some places in China to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the light of the plight of humans because of SARS, Meers and Covid-19, an appropriate preparedness and response plan should be prepared.
The fact suggests that many viruses have taken their place on the planet for a very long time.
They live in their own natural warehouses until they come up with an opportunity to spread and expand.
Although bats carry many properties that are likely to spread viruses, human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if humans adopt a culture that requires them to stay away from them.
Continued monitoring of mammals is a necessary procedure to better understand the environment of coronavirus viruses and their natural hosts, which proves useful in preventing their transmission from animals to humans and preventing future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent animal viral diseases is to distance humans from the environment of natural reservoirs of animal diseases.
The mystery of the origin of the disease is still surrounded by many questions that require answers.
First, if the original virus bats of SARS COF-2 are transported to the measles, it is important to know the conditions that are set for the sharing of bats and the animals of fertilized ants where the same environment is.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in the transmission of the disease to humans, then the way humans communicate with them should be determined.
Third, if a third type of mammals plays the role of a true broker host, then it should be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and anaesthetic ants.
Finally, since many mammals including pets may be suspected of carrying SARS Cof-2, both monitoring and experimental infections should be performed.
Whether the host is a bat, an ant, or other mammals, it is expected to identify SARS Coff-2 or the parental viruses that are subdivided from which are almost identical in their future natural hosts.
Continued research in this area will reveal the evolutionary path of SARS Cof-2 in animals, with important measures to prevent and combat COVID-19 in humans.
Need to update a standard - a suspected condition - and a confirmed condition - when diagnosed with COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a rapid guidance on the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection 2019 (new coronavirus-2019), which provided our experience and included appropriate reference information to combat the pandemic worldwide.
Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on ongoing research results and clinical practice experiences; thus diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidance and presented the latest diagnostic criteria, a suspected case, and a “confirmed case”, according to the latest Kovid-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (the newest coronavirus-2019), which is now officially known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was named the Coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS COV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO described Covid-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS Cof-2 infection, our team has formulated a rapid guidance guide and published it online in the Journal of Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
He has been very interested since his publication.
Please note that although Kovid-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice experiences; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the Kovid-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn) were issued between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, with seven overall versions changing contexts.
Our guidance now responded to a comment from Cho et al., making a simple proposal to monitor scores based on clinical experience.
Their efforts have added a new guide to our guidance as well as a valuable reference to this pandemic worldwide.
We support their great effort and express our appreciation.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest Covid-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines (the 7th trial version) and recent studies.
According to version 7 (3 March 2020), confirmation of the suspected case needs to combine any elements of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to reach a comprehensive analysis, or to investigate three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) date including travel to the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities that reported cases of COVID-19, or residence during the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) date of contact with cases of SARS Cof-2 infection (with positive results of the DNA test); (3) date of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan, surrounding areas or other communities that reported cases of COVID-19 during the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) date including communication with a combination of confirmed cases (2 or more cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office or classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) showing the total number of white blood cells normal, slightly, or lower than the number of lymphocytes at the early stage of onset of infection.
The confirmed case diagnosis should be based on a suspected case involving any of the elements of evidence of the presence of pathogens or blood serum interactions as follows: (1) positive as a result of the real-time BCR test for SARS Cof-2; (2) high cognosis of the entire viral genome sequence with known novel coronavirus characteristics; (3) positive results of the IgM and the IgG antibody test for SARS Cof-2 in the serum; or the change of the IgG antibody body to SARS Cof-2 is negative to positive, or the higher comparison in recovery is equal to or greater than 4 times that level at the acute stage.
The real-time polymerase reaction test for DNA in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second version (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020).
The detection of pathogens in the blood sample was added to the fourth version (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020); then the evidence for blood serum interactions was added to the seventh version.
These modifications were based on the ongoing work of researchers to achieve the design of an ideal DNA detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples of respiratory tract including blood samples, which increased the availability of different samples, and supported the transfer of the positive result of the qualitative antibody to confirmed case criteria.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that we are cautious when dealing with patients with unusual symptoms and unacquainted with symptoms.
Therefore, the content of the information flow scheme should be updated to Cho et al., where they classified the person without clinical symptoms as a low risk.
The score monitoring system also needs to verify its validity in practice and additional clinical studies.
Finally, we hope to access more direct evidence and we invite readers to provide us with their comments.
To diagnose the situation of the suspect - and the confirmed situation - we call for the follow-up and commitment of the latest guidance issued by the home countries.
Our team will also update our guidance in time to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily rate
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on that day.
This is the largest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
The Institute of Epidemiology and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh reported that, until yesterday, 114 active cases and 33 home-based recovery cases were recorded.
17 deaths have been recorded.
The Director of the Institute for Epidemiology and Disease Control and Research, Dr. Mirjadi Sabrina Flora, reported at an online press conference that the deaths included four males and one female.
According to Dr. Merjadi, there were two cases aged over 60, two between 51 and 60, and one between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said two deaths were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 an outbreak on March 11.
A hospital official told Anadol, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saif Al-Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-corruption Authority, who was receiving care at Kuwait Maitre Hospital.
The Minister of Land and Bridge Transport of the State of Bangladesh, a slave of the ability, said in a video statement online on Saturday that public transport would stop longer than initially planned, until next Saturday.
Public transport was initially disrupted on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of commodities is still allowed: medical products, fuel and food.
The first cases of COVID-19 were recorded in Bangladesh on March 8, for two people who had returned from Italy, as well as one wife.
The three recovered by March 19.
The number of SARS Cof-2 infections has exceeded 1 million worldwide
The data released by Johns Hopkins University on Thursday indicated that the total number of cases of severe acute respiratory coronavirus cases (SARS Coff-2) exceeded one million worldwide.
Covid-19 disease caused by coronavirus in at least 52,000 deaths.
This serious development came on the same day as Malawi confirmed first coronavirus infections, and its first associated death was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed to be one of the few countries still free of coronavirus infections from Thursday.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced 1051635 confirmed cases, up to yesterday, of 79332 in the twenty-fourth hour preceding 10 a.m. Central European time (0800 p.m.) on April 4.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the United States of America, with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported more than 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday caused by coronavirus infections.
Countries around the world have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Mr. Sergei Sobianin, Mayor of Moscow, announced on Thursday that the city would be closed until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that he would continue to pay salaries to Russians without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; the vote was approved with 215 votes, 10 abstentions, and one against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the ban on walking in the cities of Mecca and the city of Manura throughout the day, where it was previously from 3 p.m. to just 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to impose a roaming ban from 10 p.m. to 4 p.m.
The Governor of Ohio, Mr. Mike De Wayne, announced that the state extended the order to stay home until May 1.
Australia stores lower the limits of buying toilet paper for each transaction
Australian shop chains Wall Worths and Coles on Saturday evening and Sunday stressed the restrictions on buying toilet paper to cut it to two weddings from Wall Worths stores and one collust for each transaction in all branches across the country.
Aldi’s stores were also set for one holiday, on Monday.
These purchase restrictions were published as messages at payment points in store chains and on their Facebook pages.
Buyers have reportedly stored them due to concerns about COVID-19 disease if people need self-insulation.
Wall Worths stores on Wednesday approved restrictions on delivery of toilet paper to the homes to become one suit for each purchase request.
These changes came after previous restrictions that were approved by Wall Weths on March 4 and Coles on March 5 to allow for only four weddings per transaction.
In its March 8 media release, Coles reported that despite the application of the restrictions on the four holidays, many stores still sell all they have within one hour of receiving - and the request has been described as \"unprecedented\" as well as Aldi stores in a Facebook post on Tuesday as \"unforeseeable\".
Sales increased - a significant increase - last week, according to a spokesman for Wall Weths stores.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also identified the amount allowed to buy it as two vents.
To ease the shortage, Coles stores asked suppliers for larger savings and increased delivery frequency, and Wall Wortz stores asked for additional stock, while Aldi stores provided their stock for special offers scheduled for Wednesday early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to increase stock, but the local council's restrictions on the time of delivery of trucks are getting more complicated.
The cost of production is expected to rise, as suppliers try to meet the demand, with little special offers.
On Tuesday, Aldi stores announced that as a result of the early availability of stock, some stores will not be able to offer their own Wednesday offer.
Dr. Gary Mortimer, retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said in a report to News.com.au that stores fill stores every night.
Toilet paper was a large commodity, leading to a reduction in the quantity of stocks in terms of numbers, and when sold in full, large empty spaces were left on the shelves, thus boosting the sense of shortage.
According to ABC News, Russell Zimmerman said: \"The Coles and Wall Wrights stores have a view that if many goods are available on the shelves, and if you can buy products such as toilets and complexes and provide them in large quantities, it may reduce panic.\"
Who Gives a Crap, which produces recycled toilet paper, reported on Wednesday that its stock was running out.
According to a report by News.com.au, Cambridge-Clark, which produces the Clinx toilet towels, and Solaris Beber, which produces sorbent towels, confirmed that they are working 24/7 to continue providing their products.
Domain.com, a real estate site, said some real estate sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first tenderer at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held because buyers stopped working on the long weekend of Labour Day.
Thursday's edition of the NT News, a daily edition in Darwin, included ads from eight pages made so that it could be cut and used as a toilet card.
Stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report issued by the ABC Australia on March 3, where the stores said they did not have plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a great demand for other products, including kumams, complexes, dried goods, hand washing and precision.
In the same vein, outside Australia, on Sunday evening it was observed that a British online store named Ocado identified the purchase of Andres toilet paper with two 12 cartons.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says Covid-19 is a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 -- a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus known as SARS COV-2 -- had reached the level of the pandemic.
Although the word “ruin” refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease, not to the seriousness of certain cases, WHO has warned that governments should take the necessary measures:
All countries can still change the course of this epidemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Giprisus said: “If countries discover and carry out tests for people, treat them, isolate them, track their cases and mobilize them to confront.”
We're all very worried about the levels of proliferation and the alarming risk, as well as the levels of inaction that are at risk.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, this pandemic has never been seen.
In a statement published by CNN in February, the course of any other respiratory virus was not followed from the beginning of the emergence to the ongoing global spread, other than flu.
Giprisus expressed a similar view, saying: “We have never experienced a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.
“We don’t see anything that can be controlled at the same time.
The new situation is described as a pandemic following the WHO’s decision in January to declare the disease to be a public health emergency that raises international concerns.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fawchi, said about the outbreak: “The conclusion of saying things are going to get worse.
According to Associted Press, there are at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide from Thursday, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS Coff-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and declared an emergency of public health as an international concern on January 30, 2020, and was recognized as an epidemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in some 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
China’s mortality rate is estimated at 4%, while globally ranging from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
The complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The period between exposure to injury and symptom onset is usually about five days, but may range from two to 14 days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Basic treatment is supportive treatment and symptoms. The preventive procedures recommended include hand washing, oral coverage when coughing, maintaining separation between people, monitoring, and self-insulation of suspected patients.
Authorities around the world respond to this risk by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, bans, workplace risk controls and closures.
This pandemic has led to severe global social and economic disruption, the delay or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, cultural, and widespread shortages of supplies is exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4% of the world’s students.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, others of origin, the appearance of East and Southeast Asia, and other areas where large cases of HIV infection have occurred.
As a result of reduced travel and closure rates for heavy industries, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
The health authorities in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, reported a group of cases of pneumonia for an unknown reason on December 31, 2019, and the investigation began in early January 2020.
The cases are mostly linked to the Wuhan market for seafood for wholesale, so the virus is believed to have animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS Coff-2, a newly detected virus that is closely linked to coronavirus in bats, coronaviruses in anaesthetic ants, and SARS-Coff. It was later discovered that the first person with symptoms was infected on December 1, 2019, and this person did not have a clear connection with the subsequently detected wet market group.
Of the early case range reported in December 2019, one third were found to be related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report published by South China Morning reported that a situation dating back to November 17, 2019, 55 years of Hubei province, probably the first case. On February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization reported that despite the decline in new cases in China reported, it suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, where the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases inside them for the first time.
There may be a significant lack of reporting of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By February 26, a relatively few cases were reported among young people, with 19 years of age and under making up 2.4% of cases worldwide. UK’s leading scientific advisor, Patrick Valence, estimated that 60% of British infections were needed before effective herd immunity was performed.
Cases indicate the number of persons who have been tested for COVID-19 and confirmed their injury in accordance with the official protocols.
As of March 23, no testing country had more than 3% of its population, and many countries had formal policies regarding the non-testing of those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A March 16 study found that an estimated 86% of COVID-19 cases were not detected in China until January 23, and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79% of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 indicated that the number of injuries in Italy was much greater than reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for Covid-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States concluded that it might be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the period from worsening symptoms to death takes between 6 and 41 days, the most common of which is 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, Kovid-19 caused about 97,000 deaths.
About 80% of deaths in China were concentrated in people over the age of 60, and 75% had pre-existing pathology, including cardiovascular and diabetes. Official statistics for deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to people who were confirmed to have covided according to official protocols.
The real number of deaths due to COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who die without testing them - for example, at home, in the care role of older people, etc.
Part data in Italy revealed that the number of excess deaths during the outbreak exceeded the official number of Covid deaths recorded in the 4-5x factor.
A spokeswoman for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States said that we know that [the number of deaths declared] reflects a lower estimate than reality - a statement supported by narrative reports that indicate the inaccuracy of the United States. Such a kind of lack of estimate occurs in case of pandemics; such as the H1N1 epidemic in 2009 was the first confirmed death in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
It was the first death outside China on February 1 in the Philippines, and was the first death outside Asia in France on February 14.
By February 28, more than twelve deaths were recorded outside the mainland of China in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, more than 40 countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except the South Pole. Many measures are commonly used to determine the mortality rate.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the size of tests, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options and the time spent since the onset of the disease outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and public health. Death to injury ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed during a given period of time.
Based on Johns Hopkins’ statistics, death to injury is 6.0% globally (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the percentage of deaths from injuries fell from 17.3% (for those who died from the symptoms from January 1 to January 10, 2020) to 0.7 percent (for those who showed symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other measures point to the CFR mortality rate, which reflects the percentage of those who died from the disease, and the rate of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of the infected (who have been confirmed and who have not been confirmed) who die from a disease.
These statistics do not have a time frame and follow a specific population group from an injury to knowledge of the fate of the situation.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for certain population groups.
Oxford University's evidence-based medical center estimates that the mortality rate for the whole pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest estimate of this range is in line with the results of the first random testing of Covid-19 in Germany, and with a statistical study analysing the impact of the test in case mortality estimates.
The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes the possibility of controlling the pandemic.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by location.
Masig-Booney, from the University of Pennsylvania, said: “The outbreak of infectious diseases that leave them uncontrollably peaks and begins to decline after that when the disease is not found by available hosts.
But it's almost impossible to reach any logical expectation now about the timing of that.
China’s top medical adviser, Chung Nanchen, said it could end by June if all countries could be motivated to follow WHO advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kocharsky of the London School of Health and Hot Zone Medicine reported that SARS Coff-2 would be deployed for perhaps one or two years.
According to a study conducted by the London Imperial College under the supervision of the world, Neil Ferguson will need to rely on physical distancing and other measures - until it becomes a vaccine available (perhaps after 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, \"I think this coronavirus isn't likely to completely disappear -- because it's easily transferable -- and it could turn into a seasonal disease -- where it returns every year.
The severity of the return will depend on the collective immunity and extent of the transformation.
Covid-19 symptoms may be relatively non-specific and symptoms may not appear on the infected.
The two most common shows are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, discharge of the respiratory language (g), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, inflammation of the throat, headache, chills, vomiting, blood circulation, diarrhea, or sneezing. The World Health Organization confirms that almost one in six people suffer from severe illness and have difficulty breathing.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States is limited to emergency symptoms in difficulty in breathing, pain or persistent chest pressure, sudden discomfort, difficulty waking up, thinness of the face or lips. Instant medical care is advised if these symptoms occur. The development of the disease may lead to acute pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, infection, and death.
Symptoms may not appear on some of the infected, who do not have clinical symptoms but confirm the results of the analyses, so specialists have provided advice that mixed people should be monitored for cases that have been confirmed and examined closely to exclude the infection.
Chinese estimates of the rate of symptom-free cases range from just a few to 44%.
The usual period of nursery (the period between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to 14 days; it is often five days. As an example of confusion, the estimate of the share of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30%, and later the ratio fell to 15%.
Some details about how the disease is spreading are still being examined.
It is believed that the disease is mainly spread during mixing or by spreading spray when coughing, sneezing or talking; when mixed at a distance of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without oral coverage may result from spraying spreads from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some see that the virus may also be transmitted through long-standing spraying, which may be produced while talking. It may also produce respiratory spray during the exhalation process, including when talking, although the virus does not carry air in general.
The spray may fall on the mouths or noses of close people or be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as tubing and pulmonary cardiac recovery (CPR) may cause respiratory discharges to be released as a spray and thus cause air spread.
It may also spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the likelihood of spread from feces to mouth, the risk is believed to be limited.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of moving SARS Cof-2 from feces to mouth. The virus is most infected during the first three days of symptoms, although it may spread before any symptoms appear and during later stages of the disease.
People have been diagnosed with the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, indicating the possibility of transmission before severe symptoms occur.
There are only a few reports of cases without laboratory confirmed symptoms, but non-symptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during mixing tracking surveys.
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) confirms that despite some uncertainty about how easily the disease spreads, one person can prepare two to three others in general. The virus remains on surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, it has been found that the virus can be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene), 304 stainless steel, one day on reinforced paper, and up to four hours on copper.
However, this varies based on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been confirmed to be infected with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, British authorities recommend washing hands after mixing animals, such as when touching other surfaces that a infected person may touch.
Coronavirus 2 is associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS Cof-2), a newly developed virus, where, for the first time, three people with mixed pneumonia were isolated from a group of cases with acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
The SARS Cof-2 virus shares all of its characteristics with coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, the virus kills home soap, where its protective membrane is dissolved. The SARS Cof-2 virus is closely associated with the original SARS Cof virus.
He thinks he has animal origin.
The genetic analysis revealed that the Coronavirus genetically meets with the coronavirus beta, falling under the sub-sex of the Coronavirus Sarby (series B) as well as the two baskets created by their bats.
96% of all genome levels are identical with other samples of coronavirus in bats (Bat Cof Rat G13)
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between viruses generated by fertilized ants and viruses created by humans.
A comparison of the entire genome to date has shown that 92% of genetics between coronavirus and SARS COV-2 have been found to be insufficient to prove that fertilized ants are the intermediate family of this virus.
The infection can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, although the confirmation is eventually made by the reaction of the reverse-record polymerase (RT-BCR) to infected releases or computerized clip-imaging.
A study in Wuhan, which compares sequence polymerase activity with computerized clip-imaging, indicated that computerized machining is more sensitive than sequence polymerase interaction, although less accurate, with many of its imaging properties entering with pneumonia cases and other pathological stages.
As of March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiography recommends not to use computerized clip-imaging to detect COVID-19 or consider it an initial examination for the diagnosis of the disease.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published several Repozy DNA test protocols for the SARS Cof-2 virus for the first time on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RR-PCR) in real time.
The test can be performed on samples of the respiratory tract or blood.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
This test is generally carried out through an nose-blossomic exam, and a throat scan can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies develop synthetic tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them proved sufficiently accurate to widely adopt their use.
An analytic test developed by Selix has been accredited for emergency use in the United States in approved laboratories only.
The imaging properties of CTs include people who have symptoms of the disease as non-likely as classed glass jars and dissipated crystals.
The Italian Radiology Association collects an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Radioimaging without a sequence polymerase reaction is a limited measure of accuracy in relation to the detection of COVID-19 because it interferes with other diseases such as infections of the coronavirus.
A large study in China compared the results of computerized cut-off imaging with the reaction of sequence polymerase and proved that although the imaging is less accurate in terms of evidence of injury, it is faster and more sensitive, proposed as a screening tool in the epidemic areas.
AI-based neural networks have been developed to detect the characteristics of HIV imaging in both radio and computerized imaging.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and using a toilet when coughing or sneezing and then throwing it directly into the basket of neglect.
Those who carry the infection have already been advised to wear a medical mask in public places.
Physical separation measures are also recommended to prevent transmission of infection. Several unnecessary travel governments from and to countries and regions affected by the outbreak have been banned or advised not to travel.
However, the virus has reached the stage of spread in society as a whole in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spread within communities, and some individuals don’t know where or how they have been infected. Health care providers, who care for a person who is potentially infected, are advised to use the measures considered, the precautions of mixing and eye protection. Mixers of infected people are advised to be an effective way of identifying the source of infection and preventing it from spread.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations demanding that such surveillance be restricted.
Many mobile apps have been designed or introduced for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than twelve specialized groups have worked to find privacy-sensitive solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record how close the user is to other mobile phones.
Users will then receive a message if they get close to someone who has been shown to be infected with COVID-19. Wrong concepts about how to prevent infection are promoted; for example, washing the nose and throat with mouthwash is not a solution.
There is no vaccine to date for COVID-19, although many organizations work to produce a vaccine.
Wash hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when they appear on the hands, before eating, and after emptying your nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because home soap kills the virus outside of the body; it destroys its protective membrane.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention also recommended using a hand complex containing at least 60% alcohol when water and soap are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces can be cleared using several cleansings (within one minute of the clean-up on the surface of stainless steel), including; ethanol 62-71%, isopropanol 50-100% and sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and iodopodone 0.2-7.5%.
There are other cleaners, such as Benzalconium chloride and chlorhexide gluconate, with less effectiveness.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that when a person is suspected or confirmed to have been injured in a facility as an office or a care centre, all places such as offices, bathrooms, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control devices, and ATMs used by the patient must be sterilized.
Health organizations have instructed people to cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing either by bending, placing it in front of the mouth and nose or using paper towels and immediately removing any towels.
Those who are likely to be infected with medical masks are advised to wear the mask less the size of the respiratory spray and the distance it is cut when it spreads due to speech, tenderness and cough.
WHO has issued instructions on timing and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virus scientist at Leeds University, “the wear of a mask [people]’s desire to touch their faces can be reduced, which is a major source of infection if hands are not properly cleaned” people are advised to take care of people who are likely to have the disease with masks.
WHO recommended that healthy people wear masks only if they are exposed to high risk of infection, such as those who take care of COVID-19, although they also recognize that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries started encouraging ordinary people to wear face masks.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States recommends wearing a non-medical mask made of cloth. China specifically recommended that health care providers use disposable medical masks, especially in case of mixing people (at a distance of 1 metre (3 feet) or less) directly.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage individuals to make masks of cloth at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited going out to public places without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government required everyone entering a store to wear a mask.
Israel has asked the entire population to wear masks in public places.
Taiwan, which produces 10 million masks a day since mid-March, has asked train passengers and urban transport buses to wear masks on April 1.
Panama made wearing a face mask when coming out necessary, with the recommendation also to manufacture face masks at home for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by at least reducing the mix between individuals.
Roads include quarantine; travel restrictions; school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping malls.
Individuals can apply social isolation methods by staying at home, reducing travel, avoiding busy areas, changing smiles without touching, and physically distancing others.
Many governments currently impose or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum volume of gatherings recommended by U.S. government and health organizations has been reduced rapidly from 250 people (if no spread of COVID-19 is detected in the region) to 50 people and 10 people later.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older people and those with chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, high blood pressure, and weak immune systems are facing increased risk of serious diseases and complications and have been advised by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention to stay at home as far as possible in areas of the outbreak of the disease between communities. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health bodies began replacing the term “social distancing” with the term “physical isolation” to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social ties, either virtually or at a distance.
The use of the term “social exclusion” has led to the assumption that people must engage in full social isolation, rather than encourage them to communicate with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
This includes recommendations that only have sex with someone living with whom you are not pregnant or suffering from the virus.
Self-insulation is recommended at home for people with COVID-19 who are suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-insulation. Several governments have imposed or recommended self-health quarantines for all populations living in affected areas.
The most powerful self-health quarantine instructions were issued to those of the most at-risk groups.
Those who have been treated with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where the infection is widely transmitted to self-health quarantine for 14 days have been advised.
Strategies to control the spread of the disease are containment or braking and reduction of spread.
Containment is applied in the early stages of the disease outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected as well as to introduce other measures to combat infection and vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When the prevalence of the disease becomes impossible, efforts are then directed towards the mitigation phase: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health-care system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be undertaken at the same time.
It requires more stringent measures to reverse the course of the pandemic by reducing the number of primary reproductions to less than 1. Part of the management of infectious diseases is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, while it is known that the epidemic curve is flattened.
This reduces the risk of stress on health services and saves more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may address the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, masks and self-cleaning; community action aimed at physical separation such as school closures and cancellation of major gatherings; community solidarity to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning. More stringent measures have been taken to contain the outbreak in China as soon as the severity of the outbreak has become clear, such as the application of quarantine to all cities and the imposition of a strict travel ban.
Other countries have also taken a variety of measures aimed at reducing the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass testing and local quarantines and issued warnings about the movements of the wounded.
Singapore provided financial support to the injured who isolated themselves and imposed great fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and has criminalized the acquisition of medical supplies. Simulations of the United States and Great Britain show that mitigation (promoting and not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and curbing (reverse to the growth of the epidemic) are facing major challenges.
Optimization policies may reduce health-care demand by 2/3 and mortality by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and stress in health systems.
Cough may be preferred but should be maintained as long as the virus is spread in humans (or until the vaccine becomes available, if this occurs first), as the movement on the other hand is rapidly rejuvenated when the measures are mitigated.
Long-term intervention to curb the pandemic causes social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drugs are approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are under way, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking medicines to treat colds that are released without a prescription, drink fluids, and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Based on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may worsen the results.
Many previously approved compounds are subjected to the treatment of other viral diseases for use in Covid-19 treatment.
The World Health Organization (WHO) also said that some traditional and home remedies could provide relief of the symptoms caused by SARS COVID-19.
The increased capacity and adaptation of healthcare centres to provide the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as basic measures to respond to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the European Regional Office of the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for the transfer of resources at multiple levels, including the focus of laboratory services on the Kovid-19 test, the cancellation of optional procedures, the separation and isolation of COVID-19 patients, increased intensive care capacities through staff training and increased number of artificial respiratory devices and the available family.
There are multiple theories about where the first condition (the so-called zero patient) originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus may be due to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has gradually increased.
These were mostly linked to a wholesale seafood market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus came from one of these animal species; or, in other words, has an animal origin. A group infected with pneumonia was observed for an unknown reason on December 26 and was treated by Dr. Zang Armyn at Hobe County Hospital, who reported the Center for Disease Control in Jianghan Bohan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of Coronavirus-like SARS.
The police alerted eight of these doctors, including Lee Wen Liang, to spread false rumors, and another doctor, i.e., was baffled by her presidents to raise the alarm.
The Wahan Municipal Health Committee later issued a public notice on 31 December and reported to the World Health Organization.
Enough cases of unknown pneumonia have been reported to the health authorities in Wuhan, leading to early January investigation. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases of infections was nearly every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus moved to other Chinese provinces, with the help of movements during the New Chinese Year's New Year's and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub and a major rail crossing point.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Schengen.
Official data later show that 6,174 people have already had symptoms by 20 January 2020. As of 26 March, the United States of America and Italy have exceeded the world’s most confirmed cases of infections. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide, with more than 97,000 people killed and more than 364,000 recovered.
At least 200 countries and territories have registered at least one case.
Due to the outbreak in Europe, many countries in the Schengen region have restricted freedom of movement and imposed border controls.
National reactions included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as home stay orders, storage orders, or closures) and bans. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were subjected to a closure in the United States, more than 50 million people were closed in the Philippines, about 59 million people were closed in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were closed in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were subjected to one form of closure, which rose to 2.6 billion people two days later - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 is due to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; one of the unconfirmed reports indicates that the first case was on November 17.
Dr. Zang noted a group of pneumonia cases that were caused by unknown cases on December 26, and subsequently informed her hospital of the disease control centre in Jianghan Wuhan on December 27.
The first gene test for patient samples on December 27, 2019 pointed to the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
The State Health Committee issued a public notice on 31 December.
The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed the same day.
With these notifications, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police about the spread of rumors about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no clear evidence of moving from one person to another.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a popular war to contain the spread of the virus.
It was described as “the largest health stone in human history” that was announced on January 23 to stop traveling from and to Wuhan, extending to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting some 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city has been reduced.
New Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were cancelled in several places.
Authorities have also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshinshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was built after that, Lichenchen Hospital, to deal with additional patients.
In addition to newly established hospitals, China has also transformed 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took other measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including providing health advertisements to travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools have also been closed across the country.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions have taken several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote action measures have been taken in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were imposed inside and outside of Hubei.
Public transport was modified, and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
The control of the public movement in several cities is estimated to be around 760 million people (more than half of the population) have been subjected to one form of exit restriction. After the outbreak became global in March, Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent, bring, and prevent, the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory health stone on all returnees to the city from other countries. On 23 March, one local case in China’s mainland land moved over the last five days by a passenger returning to Guanzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese State Council President Li Khaqiang said the spread of locally transmitted infections and the control of the outbreak in China was scrambling.
The travel restrictions in Hubei were reduced on the same day, with the exception of Wuhan, two months after the closure. China's foreign ministry announced on 26 March 2020 the suspension of visa holders' entry or residence permits from 28 March onwards, with no specific details on the deadline for the policy to end.
Those who wish to enter China will be forced to apply for visas for Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged businesses and factories to resume work on March 30 and provided a cash incentive group for companies. The State Council announced a three-minute silence beginning on April 4 at 10:00, in conjunction with the Qing Ming Festival, although the central government called on families to show respect online, taking into account the physical distance to avoid the spread of COVID-19 again.
Kovid-19’s transition from China to South Korea was confirmed on January 20, 2020.
The National Health Agency has announced a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a gathering in Daijo of a new religious movement known as the Church of Shincheonji Jesus.
Shenzhenji's followers who visit Daijo from Wuhan were suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, 1,261 people or about 13% of 9,336 church followers reported symptoms. South Korea announced the highest levels of preparedness on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were subjected to quarantine after tests confirmed that three soldiers were infected with the virus.
Flight dates were also affected, and then changed. South Korea introduced a program that was considered the largest and best organization in the world to examine people for the virus, isolate any infected, and track their mixtures and undergo quarantine.
The methods of testing included mandatory personal reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via mobile application, testing the virus on people inside their cars, making the test results available the next day, and increasing testing capabilities to 20,000 people a day.
South Korea’s program is a success in controlling the outbreak despite not applying quarantines to entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae In’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions asking either to isolate Moon alleged government abuse of the outbreak, or to pay tribute to his response.
On March 23, it was announced that South Korea had had the lowest total cases in one day in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that as of April 1, all new arrivals from abroad would be subject to stone for two weeks.

Plans to reduce intercity travel were announced in March, although intense traffic between cities continued before the New Year of Paris.
Shi’ite shrines remained open for pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran during February has become a centre for the spread of the virus after China.

Iran’s parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members reported to have been infected on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on Iranian prison authorities to release unconditionally detained human rights defenders for peaceful opposition, and also for temporary release of qualified prisoners.

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the mitigation of economic sanctions on the countries most affected by this pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed in Italy on January 31, when SARS-Coff-2 tests for Chinese tourists came in positive Rome.

The CNN report noted that a combination of a large number of older people and the inability to test all people with HIV so far in Italy may have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as the most comforting among the affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British government did not impose any form of social isolation or comprehensive quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for its remarkable lack of speed and intensity in responding to the public’s concerns.

On January 23, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement the ban on transport in Wuhan, WHO representative Goden Gallia noted that while it is certainly not a recommendation made by the World Health Organization (WHO) - it was a very important indicator of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is severely concentrated - and described it as an unprecedented public health history - on January 30, after confirming the transition from one person to another outside China, and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the outbreak as an international public health emergency, the sixth case of public health emergencies since the first resort to this procedure during the swine flu pandemic in 2009.
The WHO Director-General said that the fact that the outbreak is a public health emergency is an international concern is due to the risk of global proliferation, particularly in low- and middle-income countries that do not have strong health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros said there was no reason to take measures that would unduly conflict with international travel and trade and that the World Health Organization does not recommend limiting trade and mobility.

On the same day, Tedros stated that United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has agreed to provide “the potential of the entire United Nations system to respond”
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team has been prepared, allowing for coordination of the entire UN response, and WHO will allow it to focus on health response while other agencies’ expertise to learn about the social, economic and broader development impacts of the outbreak can be used.
On February 14, a team of a WHO-led joint mission with China was prepared to provide international experts and experts from the World Health Organization on the ground in China to assist with local administration, evaluate and transport the disease by hosting workshops and meetings with key national institutions, and undertake field visits to assess the impact of response activities at the provincial and urban levels, including urban and rural areas, on February 25, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that more needs to be done to prepare for the potential coronavirus pandemic, noting that it is too early to describe it as a pandemic, but that countries should be in preparation.

Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in a statement that “this is a real test for every government on the ground: so we have to prepare.
This virus may be on its way and you have to prepare for it - and urge the right response measures that can help the world avoid -- what's worse.
Ryan also said that current data do not justify public health officials declaring the disease as a global pandemic, saying such a declaration means that we essentially accept that every human on this planet will be exposed to this virus.
On March 11, the World Health Organization announced the outbreak of coronavirus as a pandemic.
The Director-General said that the World Health Organization (WHO) is deeply concerned about the alarming levels of spread, severity, and alarming levels of inaction, and that WHO has faced severe criticism of what is seen as inadequate treatment of the pandemic, including late declaration of public health emergency and classification of the virus as a pandemic.

A number of CBC managers were separated across several sectors because of their handling of quarantine efforts in central China, referring to frustration with the political institution’s response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe this move was aimed at protecting the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from public resentment over the Coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example Chao Lijian, previously rejected the recognition that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories claimed by the United States or Italy regarding the COVID-19 virus.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump described the Coronavirus as a \"Chinese virus\" or \"Wuhan virus\" saying that China has been blindening the news that has now made the virus a global pandemic -- which some critics have criticized for being racist -- and his administration's failure to contain the disease.

The source accused Russia of launching a “geographical and diplomatic” attack.
The President of Lombardy, Athelo Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi de May, denied press reports and expressed their gratitude.

The Secretary-General of the nuclear disarmament campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the training of the defenders 2020, saying: “In the context of the current public health crisis, training not only puts the lives of troops from the United States and many European countries at risk but also the population of the countries in which they are going to be carried out - the Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, with about 20 members of parliament injured as well as fifteen former or current political figures.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public message to world leaders on March 14, 2020 asking for help, saying his country is struggling to combat the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has raised calls for the United States to adopt common social policies in other wealthy countries, including comprehensive health care, comprehensive childcare, paid family leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts have predicted that this could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election.
South Korea has criticized the mysterious and negative quarantine efforts of Japan after Japan has announced that anyone coming from South Korea will be placed in quarantine at certain government sites for two weeks.
South Korean society was initially polarized by President Moon Jay In's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either to isolate Moon because of their claim that the government has abused the outbreak or praised its response. The outbreak has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concerns that this might allow governments to tighten their control over power.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Victor Orban to rule by an indefinite decree, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those who published false information about the virus and deal with the government with the crisis.
The Coronavirus outbreak, which has resulted in many supply shortages, has been blamed for the growing global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic buying, and disruption of factory operation and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the lack of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and stop suppliers.
Many areas have also seen panic-motivated purchase, which has led to the freedom of shelves from essential items such as food, toilet paper, and water bottles, causing lack of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry warned of delays in shipments of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom’s statements, demand for personal protection tools may have doubled by 100 times.
This demand increased prices up to 20 times the normal price and also delayed medical supplies for between four and six months.
It also causes a shortage of personal protection tools around the world, with WHO warning that this will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Diego shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity led to a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and later banned by the Australian government. Despite the widespread spread of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent high demand for food products, the two regions survived severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy to combat the storage of and illicit trade in vital products have been able to avoid severe food shortages in Europe as well as in North America.
North Italy has not seen its large agricultural production fall significantly, but prices may rise according to industry representatives’ expectations.
Food shelves were temporarily empty, even in Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pig meat stocks to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy that require food producers to keep stocks of such emergencies.
China felt the damage to the global economy: According to a media report on March 16, the Chinese economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 by government actions to reduce the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As China’s main land is a major economic and industrial hub, it has been observed that the outbreak poses a major and alarming threat to the stability of the global economy.
Agatha DeMaris expected the Economic Intelligence Unit to remain volatile until a clearer picture of the potential results appeared.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic implications of the epidemic on global growth could exceed those that occurred as a result of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
A Washington University expert at St. Louis estimated that the global supply chain would be affected by more than $300 billion, which could last up to two years.
According to reports, OPEC has seen an imbalance after a sharp drop in oil prices due to low demand from China.
Global stock markets declined on February 24 due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside the mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several US stock indicators, including Nasdak-100, Standard & Pors 500, and the average Dow Jones industrial decline since 2008, with Dao 1,191 points falling, the largest decline in one day since the financial crisis in 2007-08.
The three indicators ended the week down by more than 10%.
On February 28, Jacob Ratings GMBH confirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained negative expectations.
Shares fell again due to fears of the Coronavirus, and was the biggest drop on March 16.
Many believe that economic recession is possible.
The economist, Mohammed Al-Ariyan, commended the emergency measures taken by central banks and countries in a timely manner.
Central banks respond faster than they were in the financial crash in 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, closure of public places including tourist attractions, and warning governments of travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airlines, Eastern China Airlines, and Cannes, while British regional airline FlyP collapsed.
The impact on the shipping industry was at an unprecedented level.
Many train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincides with the spring season known as Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the New Chinese New Year's holiday.
National and regional governments have cancelled a number of large crowd events, including New Year’s celebrations, with private companies also closing their shops independently and tourist attractions such as Disneyland Hong Kong and Disney Land Shanghai.
Many events of the new lunar year and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent large gatherings, including the banned city of Beijing and traditional temple exhibitions.
In 24 provinces of 31 provinces, and in municipalities and regions in China, authorities extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, and instructed most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised the response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled New Year's celebrations. The retail sector worldwide has been affected by reduced hours of work in stores or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America dropped by 40%.
North American and Middle East retailers saw a decline between 50 and 60 percent.
This also led to a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Operators of shopping malls around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America more likely to suffer from this condition without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers were confined to their homes in the interior, or in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The Coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The closure in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who earn salaries through daily wages) unemployed. The Angus Reed Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian families have suffered some form of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have been employed in Spain since it closed in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany sent their workers in government-backed short-term action plans known as Corzarbit.
France and Britain have adopted a short-term job compensation plan.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as individuals - working and independent - globally.
The institutions of the arts and culture sector have sought to support their mission (often government-funded) to provide access to the cultural heritage of society, to maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, all over the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, bids, and other cultural institutions have been closed indefinitely, with their exhibitions, events, offers being cancelled or postponed.
In response, there have been intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Among other recent rapid consequences of the disease, religious services, major sports events, and other social events such as music festivals, concerts, technological conferences, and fashion shows have been cancelled.
The film industry also suffered a break. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the celebration of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place during the last week of the Christian prayer season in great fasting.
Many Christian parishes recommended that older Christians stay at home instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches made church services available via radio, live broadcasts online or television while others offer worship without leaving their cars.
With the closure of the Roman Catholic diocese in Rome of its churches and church prayers, and the removal of St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled the services and public gatherings limited to churches, mosques, temples, and Gordora.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and then closed the protests, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents into holy places in Mecca and the city.
This has caused the biggest disruption in the global sporting calendar since World War II.
Most of the major or delayed sporting events, including the 2019-20 Champions League, the 2019-20, the 2019-20, the 2020 U.S. League of Professionals, and the 2019-20 National hockey League, were cancelled.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to start at the end of July, and the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be rescheduled beyond 2020, but by summer 2021, gambling clubs and other playgrounds around the world were closed and live slots were postponed or cancelled.
This has led many players to move online, with many online gambling sites reporting significant increases in new contribution rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with different musical groups suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theatres like those in Broadway have also suspended all shows.
Some artists have discovered ways of continuing to produce and share work online as an alternative to traditional direct performance, such as live streaming parties or creating online events for artists to perform, distribute and disseminate their work.
The Internet has spread many web images about the Coronavirus where much has turned into humor and entertainment in the light of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, severe bias, xenophobia and racism have been observed against people of Chinese origin and East Asian origin, and against people from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
The incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports in February (when the majority of cases are still confined in China) documented racist feelings expressed by various groups around the world towards Chinese that they deserve the virus or receive what is alleged to be justified punishment.
Anti-China sentiment has also seen a rise in some African countries.
Many people in Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their regional origin.
There was support for Chinese both on and off the internet, and for those living in areas affected by the virus.
After the outbreak has spread in new hotspots, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, may be subjected to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed up for pressure to prevent Chinese from entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, ChineseDontComeToJapan #Twitter is issued.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported increasing levels of racist violations, as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the Coronavirus as a \"Chinese virus\", a term he considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzari.
Students coming from northeastern India, who share the border with China, who are studying in major Indian cities, have faced harassment over the coronavirus outbreak.
The head of the Bharatiya Janata party unit in West Bengal, Delip Gosh, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and \"for this reason the Lord has avenged them.\"
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later condemned these statements and described them as “mistake” and in China, the pandemic led to increased xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, where foreigners were described as “foreign peaks” and targeted to get rid of them.
Many newspapers have removed pages paid to subscribe to some or all of their coverage of Coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers related to the outbreak open.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share their results on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

The 2019 respiratory coronavirus (COVID-19) and associated SARS-COV-2 virus (SARS) laboratory test includes ways to detect the presence of the virus, where it detects antibodies that produce an infection response.
The RTB confirms the presence of viruses in the samples, as it detects coronavirus repossic DNA.
This test is accurate and designed only for the detection of the SARS-Cof-2 DNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (amismology) is used to diagnose and monitor the population.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were so simple to report or who did not show symptoms.
The exact mortality rate of the disease and the collective level among the population can be determined based on the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country in March 2020 had reliable data on the spread of the virus among its population.
On March 23, no country examined more than 3% of its population, and there is a significant indication of the number of tests carried out by various countries.
This variation is also likely to significantly affect reported mortality rates, which are likely to be highly valued in some countries.
Reverse transcription polymerase reaction (RT-BCR) can be used to test respiratory samples obtained in different ways, including the nose or mouth sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RTP that is carried out using throat swabs is based only on the first week of the disease.
The virus may disappear from the throat after that as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people who are tested in the second week, a sample of deep airways can instead be taken by suction or coughing.
One of the early BCR tests was developed in the Charity in Berlin in January 2020 using RTR-PCR polymerase reaction, which formed the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on January 23, 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech also created the PowerChek Coronavirus detection kit for SARS-Coff-2 suitable for safe clinical use and based on the BCR on January 28, 2020.
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain emergency use approval from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for a SARS-Coff-2 detection kit based on the BCR.In the United States, the disease control and prevention centres (CDC) are distributing a new 2019 coronavirus diagnostic panel (the new Coronavirus 2019) for its own RT-PCR based on public health labs through the International Discovery Materials Supply Authority.
One of the three genetic tests in the old versions of the test kits resulted in uncritical results due to defective detectors, and one phase of the test was delayed by the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in a successful average of less than 100 samples per day throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components did not have confidence until February 28, 2020, and until then government and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under emergency use permission. The U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, Lab Corp announced the availability of the COVID-19 test across the country based on the RTC.
Similarly, the Covid-19 test has been available throughout the country as of March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been announced; the sampling process must be carried out and processed in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the State Center for Research on Viruses and Biotechnology, Victor KoVID-19 test, was created and produced.
On February 11, 2020, the Federal Service for Health Care Control recorded the test. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed a Covid-19 infection detection test. On March 13, 2020, Roch Diagnostex received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours in large numbers, allowing one machine to carry out approximately 4128 tests over 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to the Abut Labs for testing on the Abut m2000 system; the Food and Drug Administration previously granted a similar permit to Lab Corp and Thermo Fisher Sinetivick.
On March 21, 2020, he received a similar emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for a test of about 45 minutes.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved a test using a heat-equipment DNA amplifier technology instead of a BCR.
Since this does not require a series of successive temperature cycles, this method can show positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States. Abet expects more manufacturing to take 50,000 tests a day. Taiwan is also developing a single-smuggling antibody test that is specifically linked to the new coronavirus protein in order to achieve results within 15 to 20 minutes such as the rapid flu test.
A review of studies in March 2020 concluded that “rayal images of the chest have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of the CT [computed stratum] may be clear even before symptoms appear.”
The usual characteristics that appear in the computerized clip-imaging include multi-disposed double-sided glass valves with an ambient, non-parallel and rear distribution.
The spread under the section develops and shows irregular patches and intensifys with the development of the disease.
A study in the city of Wuhan comparing BCR with computerized clip-imaging regarding the origin of the current pandemic indicated that computerized clip-imaging is more sensitive than BCR, although less accurate, with many of its imaging properties entering with pneumonia cases and other pathological stages.
In March 2020, the U.S. School of Radiology recommends not to use computerized clip-imaging to detect COVID-19 or consider it an initial screening for the diagnosis of the disease - and in March 2020, the CDC recommends using the BCR for initial examination.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect individual injury within a period starting 7 days or after symptoms appear, to determine immunity, and in the case of population surveillance. Analyses can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by testing the BOC.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but will depend on the availability of them on the production rate of each system.
For central laboratories, one sample of ambient blood cells is usually used, although successive samples can be used to follow up on immune response.
For the clinical care point test, a single blood sample is usually drawn by the skin leg.
Unlike the BCR methods, it is not necessary to take the pre-exam extraction step. On March 26, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration identified 29 agency notification providers in accordance with the requirements and they are able to distribute their antibody tests.
On 7 April 2020, the Food and Drug Administration adopted only one test under emergency use permission. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European credits for their testing kits, which could detect antibodies to the virus IgG and IgA in blood samples.
The test achieves several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional BCR analysis of viral rebose DNA.
Antibody detection is often possible 14 days after the start of the infection. In April, the UK discovered that the antibody testing kits it bought were not good enough to use.
Hong Kong has developed a plan whereby patients suspected of staying in their homes can be found, - the emergency department gives a sample tube to the patients - to spit in the tube, and re-enter it to the test result after a simple period. The UK National Health Service has announced that it is testing a plan to test suspected cases at home, thus excluding the risk of transmission of infection from the infected when they come to the hospital or the need to sterilize the used ambulance. When carrying out the Kovid-19 test for suspected cases without leaving the car, healthcare professionals withdraw the appropriate precautions.
In Germany, the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Doctors on March 2 said it was able to conduct approximately 12,000 tests per day for outpatients and 10.700 people tested last week.
Health insurance shall bear the costs if a doctor orders the test.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of about 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, HIV detection tests were made available inside the car in many major cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown, as only positive case results were reported.
A preliminary laboratory study revealed that from the 12/2020 calendar week, at least 483,295 samples were tested by the end of week 12/2020, and the results of 33,491 samples (6.9%) positive for SARS-COF-2 virus were.In Israel, technosians and Rampam hospital invented a method to test samples taken from 64 patients at the same time and subjected that method, by collecting samples and not conducting further tests only when the sample was found to be positive. In Wuhan, BGI opened an emergency detection laboratory of 2000 square meters in the name of “Huo-Yan” on 5 February 2020, which could test more than 10,000 samples per day.
With Wang Gian, the founder of BGI, overseeing construction and sinking 5 days in this, modelling operations showed that cases in Hubei would rise 47% and related quarantine costs would double if these testing could not be achieved.
The Wuhan Laboratory immediately followed the creation of Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai and 12 cities in total across China.
By 4 March 2020, total daily productivity was 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays released open source and multi-transmission designs that can test up to 1122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need for automated fluid treatments.
In March, the lack of detection materials and insufficientness caused a deadlock when conducting a large number of tests in the European Union, the UK and the United States.
This prompted some specialists to explore sample preparation protocols that included heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to free the reusable DNA genome for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the UAE was squared at the top of the world’s countries in terms of the ratio of the coronavirus testing of its population, which is on its way to raise the level of the test procedure to most of the population.
This was through a combination of the activation of the inside test capacity, and the purchase of a high-production laboratory with a suitable population range from Group 42 and BGI (depending on their emergency detection laboratories (Huo-Yan) in China).
The laboratory was created within 14 days, allowing tens of thousands of RTP tests per day, the world’s first laboratory to operate outside China.
Different testing methods have been developed targeting different parts of the genetic characteristics of the Coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted the German plan for the crew industry to be sent to low-income countries that do not have resources to create their own crews.
The German plan was announced on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States was not available until January 28, leading to delays in tests available in the United States. China and the United States have faced problems with the reliability of early testing kits, and these countries and Australia have not been able to provide sufficient demand-fulfilment kits and follow the recommendations of testing experts.
In return, experts said the abundance of tests in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the new Coronavirus.
The South Korean government has greatly strengthened testing capacity in private sector laboratories over several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for intensified testing programs as an optimal solution to reduce the progress of the Covid-19 pandemic. Increased testing demand as a result of the widespread spread of the virus resulted in hundreds of thousands of tests accumulated in private U.S. labs, as well as the supply of surveys and chemical detectors.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its testing teams.
In the U.S., it was found to be defective in the test kits created by the CDC; then the government removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the testing. Spain bought testing kits from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co., Ltd, but found the results inaccurate.
The company explained that incorrect results may be due to the failure to collect samples or not to use the teams correctly.
The Spanish ministry said it would refrain from buying the teams that gave incorrect results, and would replace them with other testing teams from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits bought by the Czech Republic from China were given false results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China showing that they were inaccurate.
Prime Minister Mattovich proposed to throw it into the Danube River. Professor H. Cara of the Turkish Ministry of Health reported that Turkey's test kits bought from China - a high error rate - had - prevented their use - and bought 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 announced it was not usable.
The tests, followed by a healthy stone for those found injured and tracked by those infected with SARS-COV-2, have produced positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Fo, which experienced the first deaths of COVID-19 in Italy, conducted tests on the entire population of about 3,400 people twice, taking about 10 days each.
There were no symptoms in almost half of the people whose test results were positive, and all reported cases were removed.
As a result of the ban on movement between towns, new injuries have been completely eliminated.
The coronavirus pandemic 2020 in Singapore has seen a significant decline in the prevalence rate compared to other developed countries, but without strict restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail facilities, through strict tracking of blends and restrictions on domestic travel, testing and quarantine.
Several events have been cancelled, and Singapore has already begun urging residents to stay in their homes on March 28, but schools have been reopened on March 23 after leaving.
Several other countries have also taken control of this pandemic by strict tracking of mixers and imposing restrictions on domestic travel, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent closure decisions, as in Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has revealed that countries that conducted more tests, compared to the number of deaths, have significantly lower mortality rates, perhaps because they are able to detect only mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to carry out tests or have local laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 send the first five positive samples and the first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO-approved laboratories to confirm the test.
Of the 16 approved laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column, positive by % of tests, is affected by the state’s policy of conducting the test.
The country that tests only people who are transferred to the hospital will have more positive cases than the country that is testing for all its population, whether they appear to be symptoms or not, given the equalness of other factors.
Washing hands (or washing hands), also known as hand hygiene, is a hand cleaning process for the purpose of removing pads, fats, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap at certain times during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the oral anal route.
People can also have respiratory diseases such as flu or sneezing, for example, if they don’t wash their hands before touching their eyes, noses or mouths (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five necessary moments during the day when hand washing with soap is important include: before and after sneezing, after cleaning the baby’s back or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating, before preparing food, or handling meat, fish, or raw poultry and after.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. WHO recommends washing hands:
Before preparing food, in both, and after.
Before taking care of someone sick and after.
After changing diapers for a child or cleaning them after using the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, cough, or thirst.
After touching animals, feeding them, or marrying them.
Medical hygiene for hands refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medicines or providing medical care can prevent or limit the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause the disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is particularly important for people who deal with food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important procedure for the general public.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of flu, coronavirus, other infectious diseases, preventing diarrheal infectious diseases, and reducing respiratory infections.
Reduce infant mortality at home.
A study in 2013 showed that improved hand-washing practices could lead to minor improvements in height growth in children under 5 years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as soap washing.
This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by approximately 50%.
Measures that promote hand washing can reduce diarrheal episodes by approximately one third, similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of low diarrhoea episodes can be associated with hand washing with soap. Washing hands with soap is the only most effective and least expensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARE) when applying automatic behavior in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major acute respiratory infections, is the first cause of mortality among children under the age of five, with some 1.8 million children dying annually.
diarrhea and pneumonia together cause about 3.5 million children to die annually.
According to UNICEF, turning hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an inherent habit can save lives more than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing diarrhea-induced deaths by almost half, and deaths by acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Washing hands with other hygiene measures is usually included as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (water, sanitation and hygiene).
Washing hands also protects against the dolls that are transmitted by direct physical contact.
To wash hands a simple harmful effect is that frequent washing of hands can lead to skin damage due to its dryness.
A Danish study in 2012 revealed that excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition of peeling and itching known as hand-excement or hand-skin, which is particularly common among health care workers.
Washing hands is also often seen too much as one of the symptoms of osteoarthritis disorder (OCD).
There are five necessary moments during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of diseases through the oral anal route: after the use of the bathroom (drying, deforming), after cleaning the baby’s ass (change diapers), before feeding the child, before eating, before/after preparing food or handling meat, fish or raw poultry.
A proper hand-washing method should be exercised in other cases in order to prevent the transmission of the disease, including before or after treatment of a cut, wound, after bathing, coughing or cleaning your nose, after touching or handling animals, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, hand washing is low with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A study in 2014 showed that Saudi Arabia has the highest rate and an estimated 97 per cent, and the United States approaches the middle by 77 per cent, and in China by the lowest of 23 per cent.
The basic health care programme, implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of broad action to promote the health and education of children.
Treatment of worms twice a year, in addition to washing your hands daily with soap, and cleaning your teeth daily with fluoride, is the core of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or cleaners to water enhances the removal of microorganisms from the skin.
The main effect of soap and cleaners is to reduce dissipation barriers, and to increase dissipation.
Water alone is inefficient for the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soil, are not easily dissolved in water.
However, a proper flow of water helps to cleanse.
Steel soap may carry, due to its reusable nature, bacteria acquired from previous uses.
A few studies that noted bacterial transition from contaminated steel soap have concluded that the transition is unlikely because bacteria are washed with foam.
Disease control and prevention centres still say they prefer to use liquid soap from devices that work without touching to pump soap.
Anti-bacterial soap has been widely promoted to health-care consumers.
So far, there is no evidence that the use of recommended detergents or sterilizers is chosen to eliminate antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, anti-bacterial soap contains common anti-bacterial factors such as triclosan, which do not affect a large number of strains of organisms.
So, if anti-bacterial soap does not affect antibiotic-resistant strains, it may not be as effective as it is marketed for.
In addition to reducing surface tension and skin protection factor, advanced formulations may contain acids (aseptic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as an acid regulator, anti-microbial active Benzoic acid and other skin moisturizers (bars, vitamins, menthol, vegetarian extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the University of Oregon General Health School indicated that regular soap is as effective as the anti-bacterial soap of the consumer group that contains triclosan in preventing and removing it from the hands.
Hot water suitable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm water and soap is more effective than cold water and soap in removing natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
Unlike common belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing microbial pregnancy on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or sterilizer is a material that is not water-based for hand cleaning.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol hand cleaners, which are not water-based and are sterilized through the turquoise (also known as a hand washing with an alcohol installation, a purified hand washing or hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most of them are dependent on isopropyl alcohol or compound ethanol with an enrichment factor such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or wet like symphony in a liquid, or foam for ease of use and reduce the effect of alcohol-induced drought.
Adding a diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hands containing alcohol are at least 60 to 95% effective germs.
Alcoholic sterilizers through the turkish are for bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (gold cluster octylene-resistant bacteria and vancomisin-resistant intestinal components), tuberculosis, and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory cell virus, nasal viruses, fetal viruses, fetalus, flu, hepatitis) and fungus.
Alcohol sterilizers containing 70% alcohol through the fertilization account for 99.97% (low logarithmic by 3.5, similar to a 35-fold reduction in deciple) of the bacteria found on the hands 30 seconds after they are placed and 99.99% to 99.999% (low logarithmic from 4-5) of bacteria on the hands after 1 minute of placing them. Hand sterilizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Almost completely ineffective alcohol steroids against Norovirus (or Noroc viruses), which is the most common cause of inflammation of the stomach and intestines caused by the infection, should be used enough hand sanitizers or alcohol rubs to completely digest or cover both hands.
The front and back part of the hand is separated between all fingers and sides for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel dry.
You should also wash your fingertips well and rub them in both comforts. The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands with a hand dryer, especially when your hands are clearly warmed.
The increased use of these cleaners is due to their ease of use and rapid activity in the elimination of microorganisms; however, they should not be an alternative to proper hand washing unless water and soap are available.
The frequent use of alcohol-hand complexes can cause skin dryness unless rain, skin moisturizers or both are added to the composition.
The effect of alcohol on skin dryness can be reduced or eliminated by adding two or more other drops or both to the composition.
Clinical trials have shown that sterilizers with rainy hands cause skin irritation and dryness less than soap or antimicrobial cleaners.
Sensitive skin inflammation, contactal biliary syndrome, alcohol hypersensitivity, or additives found in alcohol washing materials rarely occur.
The low probability of skin inflammation has become an attraction compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Despite the effectiveness of cleaners that are not water-based, they do not work to clear hands of organic substances, but simply to hold them.
For this reason, hand sterilizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many causes of disease, as the causes of disease remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends heavily on ingredients and composition, and historically its effect has been significantly lower than that of alcohol-dependent alcohol rubs.
Recently, formulations that use Benzalconium chloride have been shown to have a cumulative and continuous effect as an anti-microbial effect after their use, unlike alcohol that has been shown to be less effective after repeated use, perhaps due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ash or dust instead.
The effectiveness of ash or soil may be more than water alone, but it may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms they may increase the spread of the disease rather than reducing it.
ash, too, like soap, is a purified agent because it forms a alkali solution when touched by water.
The World Health Organization recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when not available.
The correct hand washing method recommended by U.S. Centers for Disease Control for disease prevention includes the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold water.
It is recommended using ongoing water because existing basins may be contaminated, while water temperature does not seem to make a difference.
Make foam on your hands with a large amount of soap, including the back of your hands and between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands well when using soap instead of water.
I'll give you at least 20 seconds.
It creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and removes fertilizers for longer periods.
Take a good shower under the water.
The hand wash inside the tub may lead to recontamination.
Dry with a clean towel or leave it to dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands are contaminated again easily. The most common parts that are overlooked are thumbs, wrists, inter-finger areas, and under nails.
Industrial nails and slit nail paint may contain fine objects.
Often it is recommended to use a wet brush to prevent dry hands, dry skin can damage it, which may increase the risk of transmission of infection.
Different low-cost options can be provided to facilitate hand-washing in developing countries, where tap water or soap is not available or both, such as pouring water from a suspended vessel or crushing suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary. In places with limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to rationalize water consumption, such as the Tibetan - and other low-cost options.
The Tibee bat is a simple technique that uses a rope hanger, and a foot-operated control arm to pour a small amount of water on the hands and soap piece.
Effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public water cycles.
An increasing number of research suggests that paper towels are healthier than electric hand dryers found in many water cycles.
In 2008, Westminster University in London conducted a study, sponsored by the European textile seminar on paper towels, to compare the hygiene levels provided by paper towels, warm-air hand dryers and newer air hand dryers.
After washing hands and drying them with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average on the fingertips by 194% and on the comfort of the hand by 254%.
Drying using exhaust air dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the fingertips by 42% and by 15% comfort.
After washing their hands and drying them with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on average decreased by up to 76% and on hand comfort by 77%, and scientists also carried out tests to determine whether there is a possibility of transmission of infection to other water cycle users and the water cycle environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The exhaust air dryer, which drives air out of the unit at speeds that may be 180 m/h (650 km/h; 400 miles/h), is capable of inflating micro-organisms from the hands and device, and the infection may be transmitted to other water cycle users and the water cycle environment up to 2 metres away.
The use of warm air dryer spreads micro-organisms about 0.25 metres from the dryer.
The paper towels did not show any significant spread of micro-organisms. In 2005, a study conducted by TøV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated ways of drying different hands.
The following changes in bacteria were observed after dry hands:
There are many different hand dryers manufacturers, and hand dryers are used to dry with paper towels.
Washing hands with hand sterilizers is an alternative while travelling because soap and water are not available.
Alcohol must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing became mandatory for a long time after gynaecologist Gennats Sylves discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that make notes to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found lower rates of infection using them.
Washing your hands for at least 15 seconds, using abundant amounts of soap, water or gel to make foam and rub each part of your hands.
The hands must be torn together and the fingers are interlocked.
If there are cuffs under finger nails, a brush with rough hair can be used to remove them.
Since germs may remain in the water on your hands, it is important to wash them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This avoids contamination of hands again from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand-washing in a health-care setting is to remove and avoid transmission of disease-causing microorganisms.
New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with large numbers of doctors forgetting to wash their hands regularly before touching patients, which transmits micro-organisms.
One study showed that proper hand-washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of blood vessels associated with the fraction by 66 per cent, and the World Health Organization has published a paper explaining how hand-washing is carried out in the healthcare sectors.
The draft hand hygiene guidance document provided by the organization can also be found on its site available for public comment.
He conducted a related review.
Commercial devices can measure hand hygiene and check it, if necessary prove compliance with regulatory rules.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has five minutes to wash hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
Before a sterilizing mission, and
After taking care of patients. Adding purified chemicals to soap ('medical' or 'anti-microbial'') adds an ingredient to the hand washing agent.
The element of this genocide may be desirable before surgery or in places where antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly spread. At the time of the excavation, one’s hands for surgery need to be provided with a tap that can be operated and stopped without touching it with hands, some of the chlorhexidin or iode smelting, sterile towels for drying hands after washing, a serene brush, and another sterile tool for cleaning under the nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and assistants up to the pile, usually from 2 to 6 minutes.
The length of the break (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When rinsed, water should be kept back from the assistants to the hands.
After washing your hands, your hands dry with a sterile cloth and wears a surgical dress.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before taking care of a sick person and after it.
In order to control the infections of cluster cervix in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of manual cleansing came from the first 20% of washing, and it gained very little additional benefit when repeated hand cleaning increased to more than 35%.
Regular soap washing leads to more than three times the rate of bacterial infectious diseases that are passed on to food compared to washing with anti-bacterial soap. Compared with alcohol-drinking with hand washing with 30-second anti-bacterial soap, an average of 26% was found to reduce bacterial pollution.
However, water and soap are more effective than alcohol washing to reduce flu H1 virus and hard-hand soaps. Measures may include improving hand hygiene in health-care settings to educate employees about hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol washing, and written and oral reminders for employees.
Further research is needed to find out which of these measures are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a key tool at a reasonable cost to achieve good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supplies, soap, hand washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to reach general hand washing behaviors.
For example, in most rural Africa there are rarely hand washing taps near any private or public toilet, although there are cheap options for building hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can be due to inherent habits rather than lack of soap or water.
The promotion of hand-washing and advocacy can affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing, and change the behaviour of the population in the long term.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches to increasing hand washing in middle-income countries are less effective, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting hand washing in schools is the three-star approach designed by UNICEF to encourage schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
When the minimum standards are achieved, schools can move from one star to up to three stars eventually.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the hand washing promotion campaigns that are being carried out to reduce diseases and child mortality.
World Day for Hand Wash is another example of awareness-raising campaigns that are trying to achieve behavior change. Because of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an express code of hand washing.
Few studies have considered the effectiveness of the overall cost of hand-washing in developing countries and their relationship with age-adjusted years by disability.
However, one review suggests that promoting soap hand washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation procedures.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people who are under critical conditions such as mothers who are just born or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century of two hand hygiene pioneers: Hungarian doctor Genats Smelves, who worked in Vienna in Austria, and English Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing.
Most people at that time still believed that the infection was due to the bad smells called miismaz.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and healthcare-related infections prompted U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more effectively as an important way to prevent infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have increased awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect oneself from these infectious diseases.
For example, posters containing the right hand washing methods were suspended next to hand washing basins in public toilets and office and airport toilets in Germany.
The phrase “clean hands of” means something that one does not want to take responsibility for or engage in collusion.
It comes from a paragraph in the Bible in which the Pentagon washed his hands from the decision of the heart of Jesus Christ, but it became a much wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare’s Macbeth play, Ms. Macbets starts washing her hands too in an attempt to clear a spot of imagination that represents her guilt for the crimes she committed and the crimes that her husband has urged her to commit.
It was also found that people, after referring to or thinking about unethical actions, tend to wash hands more than others, and tend to estimate hand washing tools more.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after this study are less likely to participate in other compensation procedures, such as volunteering.
Religions describe hand washing for both health and symbolic purposes. The washing of symbolic hands, using water without soap to wash hands, is part of the ritual washing hands that has appeared in many religions, including the Bahá’í and Hindu faith, the practice of washing hands in Judaism, the washing of hands in Christianity and the light in Islam. Religions also require washing of health hands, especially after certain acts.
Hindu, Jewish and Islam imposes hand washing after using the toilet.
Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews and Islam impose washing of hands before and after each meal.
COVID-19 risk control in the workplace
COVID-19 risk control controls at the workplace are the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for risk control controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The correct controls for workplace risk control are based on the risk assessment of exposure sources, the risk of disease in society, and the risk factors that threaten working individuals who may be exposed to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Department of Safety and Occupational Health (OHA), low-risk work involves minimum contact with the public and other business colleagues, a condition in which it is recommended to apply basic procedures for the prevention of infection, including hand washing and encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, taking into account cough and thirst, and maintaining usual practices to clean and cleanse the working environment.
Functions with medium risk include those that require frequent or close communication from individuals not known to be infected or suspected of COVID-19, but may be infected due to the ongoing transmission of infection in society or international travel.
These include workers who communicate with public audiences as in schools, high labour density work environments, and some large-scale retail outlets.
Risk control controls for this group, in addition to basic procedures for the prevention of infection, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, thirst prevention barriers, and the use of personal protective equipment available in case of treatment with a person infected with COVID-19.
The Department of Safety and Occupational Health of Health Care and the Body Reserve of Dead Persons who are exposed to a known person with COVID-19 or suspected persons are at high risk, which increases the risk of extremely high exposure if workers carry out air debris generation procedures, or collect samples from a known person or suspected of being infected with or treated with COVID-19.
Appropriate risk control controls for these workers include engineering controls such as passive pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the functional function.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have multiple effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to illness, the need to care for others, or fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, in terms of both the quality of the goods required and the methods of obtaining them (such as shopping in non-heavy hours or via delivery or shopping services without leaving the car).
Finally, shipments of goods from geographically affected areas may stop severely affected by COVID-19. The preparedness and response plan for infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive actions.
Plans address the risk levels associated with different workplaces and functional tasks, including sources of exposure, home and community risk factors, and risk factors for individual workers such as older persons or chronic medical conditions.
It also identifies the necessary controls to address those risks, and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak of the disease.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national and subnational recommendations.
The response targets for the outbreak include reducing the transmission of infection between employees, protecting people at risk of negative health complications, maintaining business operations, and reducing the negative effects on other entities on their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the society in which business activity is located affects the responses taken.
The hierarchical sequence of risk control controls is a framework widely used in the field of occupational safety and health to classify risk control controls as effective.
Because the risk of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls include removing employees from work-related risks without relying on workers’ behaviour, and can be the most cost-effective solution for implementation.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protection equipment (PBE) is less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposure situations.
All types of personal protective equipment must be selected based on the risk to which the worker is exposed, the correct fit as appropriate (e.g. breathing devices), wear continuously and correctly, regularly checked, maintained and replaced, as necessary, removed, cleaned and stored, or disposed of properly in order to avoid pollution.
According to the U.S. Department of Safety and Occupational Health (OHA), jobs that include less risk exposure involve minimal communication with the public and other business colleagues.
Basic procedures for preventing infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and complete washing of hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, taking into account coughing and sneezing, including covering the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, providing paper towels and garbage containers, preparing to work remotely or organize successively if necessary, excluding workers from using other tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and cleaning of the work environment.
The immediate identification of potential infected individuals and their isolation is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay at home until fever, signs of fever and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-resistant medicines or other drugs that improve symptoms, and that sick leave policies are flexible, and allow employees to stay at home to take care of a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to the Department of Safety and Occupational Health, medium-risk jobs include those that require frequent or close communication within six feet (1.8 m) of individuals who are not known or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-COV-2 due to the ongoing transmission of infection in the community surrounding the workplace, or due to a recent international travel to a site where infection with COVID-19 spreads.
This includes workers who are confused with public audiences as in schools, high-intensity work environments, and some large-scale retail outlets. Engineering controls for this and high-risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic thirst protections, installation of windows for customer service without leaving the car. They include management controls for this and groups with higher risk of encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing meetings face-to-face with virtual connections, creating successively organized workflows, stopping unnecessary travel to sites where there are ongoing outbreaks of COVID-19, developing emergency communications plans, including a forum to respond to workers’ concerns, providing workers with updated education and training on risk factors and preventive behaviours related to COVID-19, training workers who need to use clothing and prevention equipment, and providing resources and working environment on cleaning or cleaning.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respiratory devices.
If a person becomes sick and is on board a plane, the appropriate prevention controls for the protection of workers and other passengers include the removal of the sick passenger from others at a distance of 6 feet, commissioning one member of the flight team to serve the sick person, and providing the sick person with a mask of the face or asking the patient to cover his mouth and nose with paper towels when coughing or sneezing.
The crew should wear disposable medical gloves when dealing with a sick traveler, touching contaminated body fluids or surfaces, and possibly using additional personal protective equipment if the patient is suffering from fever, cough or difficulty breathing.
The gloves and other purposes that can be disposed of in the biological risk prevention bag must be disposed of, and the contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and sterilized afterwards. For commercial shipping, including tourist vessels and other passenger ships, risk control controls include delaying travel when the disease, self-insultation and immediately notifying the medical center on board if a person is injured or other symptoms while on board.
In the ideal situation, medical follow-up should be done in the isolated person’s cabin. For schools and childcare facilities, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a short-term closure of cleaning or cleaning if the infected person is present in the school building regardless of the spread in the community.
When there is a limit to the transmission of infection in society ranging from limited to medium, social distancing strategies such as the cancellation of field trips, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education classes, music difference classes or meals in the shell, increased distances between offices, organized successive attendance times, reduced unnecessary visitors, and used a separate health office for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a significant transmission of infection in the community, in addition to social distancing strategies, the extension of school leaving dates can be taken into account. For law enforcement officials who carry out routine daily activities, direct health risks are considered low by the Center for Disease Control.
Law enforcement officials who must communicate with individuals who have been confirmed or suspected of being infected with COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidance as medical emergency technicians, including appropriate personal protection equipment.
In the event of direct contact during detention, workers should clean and cleanse their work belts and tools before re-use using a spray or household cleaning wipe, and follow standard working procedures for dealing with pollution and disposal of used personal protective equipment and for collecting and washing clothes.
The Department of Safety and Occupational Health considers that some health care workers and the body portfolio of the dead fall into categories with high or very high risk levels.
High-risk jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to known or suspected patients with COVID-19.
These risk levels become very high if workers generate air debris, as well as collect samples from confirmed patients or suspected or treated with COVID-19.
The procedures for the generation of air debris include pipelines, cough induction procedures, pulsifiers, some dental procedures and tests, or the collection of invasive samples.
The functions of the bodies of dead bodies with high risk include employees who are involved in the preparation of confirmed or suspected bodies of persons with COVID-19 at the time of their death; those with a high risk level are very high if they perform body surgery. Additional engineering controls for these groups at risk include insulating rooms for known patients or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, including when carrying out procedures for the generation of air debris.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare settings and save dead bodies.
Samples must be treated with biosafety precautions of level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends isolation of patients coming in separate waiting areas based on whether or not they are suspected of being infected with COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Department of Safety and Occupational Health recommends using respiratory devices for those who work 6 feet away from known patients or suspected of being infected with SARS-COV-2, and those who carry out procedures to generate air debris.
In the United States, N95 filtered face masks, approved by the National Institute of Safety and Occupational Health, or better devices, must be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program, which includes installation and fitness testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve the level of comfort of workers. The World Health Organization does not recommend the use of amputations, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization recommends only using a surgical mask for inspection staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients, take care of them, or transport them without any procedures to generate air debris, the World Health Organization recommends using a surgical mask, protective glasses, facial protection, and gloves.
If the procedure is carried out, the face mask is replaced by a breath mask N95 or FFP2.
Given that the global supply of personal protection equipment is insufficient, the World Health Organization recommends that personal protective equipment be reduced by telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those in direct care to enter a hospital with a COVID-19 patient, using the necessary personal protective equipment only for the specific task, continuing to use the same respiratory mask without removing it while caring for several patients with the same diagnosis and monitoring the supply chain of personal protective equipment and coordinating it, and excluding the use of masks for individuals who do not show symptoms.

License: CC0: No rights reserved
We found ourselves in exceptional circumstances this month.
The Kovid 19 epidemic has become a clear demonstration of the global humanitarian bond and the responsibilities that we have towards others.
Our history has not seen similar challenges at all, but we know for sure that the best response is based on a kind of global empathy, cooperation and community-building, which are fundamental elements at the heart of this institution.
Our strong friendship and care between all of our colleagues through emails, calls and conversations is an amazing practical demonstration of the amazing human feelings that, fortunately, surround our business.
I am very grateful and deeply proud that you are real colleagues.
Last week, someone sent me a message to express appreciation for our work.
They reminded me of the critical importance of the world ' s ability to head towards Wikipedia at the moment, and the strong symbolism that this critical resource remains available online and a mass available to all individuals.
Your efforts have made it possible, whether it is through the continued operation of sites, our colleagues getting salaries, or providing safety to our communities.
The world needs more information available in Wikipedia than ever before.
It’s a moment when the world’s positive impact is not limited to the efforts we make, but also to the way we do it.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make significant adjustments to how we work together starting next week.
Amendments to working methods and timetables
As Robin mentioned earlier, the team met yesterday to discuss our way, our schedule for the coming days and months.
In that discussion, we looked at what we saw could be an appropriate response to what we face, and the ideal way to maintain the sustainability of the organization’s work during this period.
We have very excitedly wanted to get rid of stress and stress, and to support our long-term mission.
If you want to reduce burdens and tasks, it's okay.
All employees, contractors and contract workers:
The expected daily working period is 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We are not about to announce a holiday, if you are able to work longer than usual working hours, you may add your efforts to the task.
However, conditions in the world are currently unpredictable, and whether you want to take care of your loved ones, get goods from the basket or go to the doctor, your safety is our most important priority.
We don't follow your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
This should be understood without expressing it, but we remember it for sure.
No sick leave or paid leave is required, just inform your manager and help your team to review calendars and timetables to ensure that key areas of work are covered.
(If your doctor has a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, please tell Brian in the management of training and certifications so that the training and certification management can help to provide support and ensure that your condition receives appropriate management care).
Fellow workers receive their full wages.
We have already mentioned that, and we renew this commitment to our contractors and colleagues.
Each employee will be paid based on normal working hours during normal conditions.
This includes whether the employee is sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work to overcome the growing pressures in the world around us.
What we can do will be amazingly productive, especially during such difficult times.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We only seek to communicate with your manager so that he can know what to expect and adjust the procedures to adapt accordingly.
Some work is necessary.
There are also some things that we must maintain.
The site’s reliability engineering teams, human resources operations, trust, secretariat, fundraising (and others) are doing very important work, which may require more support.
We will start a process in cooperation with all departments to assess current goals and turn our focus into supporting the necessary elements to achieve our mission.
There is a lot of work that we should all do, and we will focus on the most important projects only.
Going through a slower pace now, it won't hurt us later.
We don’t plan to double the working time to get rid of what’s gone after the rash ends.
We are not expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines that are currently unrealistic.
We accept the fact that these conditions have changed, and we will work to set new targets and timetables when it becomes appropriate.
What happens in annual planning (APP)?
To adapt to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to modify our annual planning delivery schedule for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose extending our 2019-2020 plan to allow more time to design the budget to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and care for loved ones with the status of those who need to work within a time schedule with reduced working hours or want to do so in the next few weeks.
This extension of the schedule eases the current planning workload and pressure across the organization as a whole.
We will submit our proposal to the Governing Council next week and we will inform delegates and teams of the developments regarding the following steps once confirmation has been obtained.
We thank the annual planning team for its leading role in this matter.
Status of office, exposure and cleaning
We learned last week that one of our colleagues working in San Francisco might have been infected with COVID-19.
However, from the very strictness and prohibition, we employed a virus-resistant cleaning team to clear all surfaces at the San Francisco office.
The team may use the grade-resistance solution used in hospitals to clear all surfaces, as well as the lounge and elevator units that lead to our floor.
The building applied its own duty of care protocol using products that support the safety of tenants.
We feel comfortable because the office has become adequately ready until the time we decide to return to work.
Our office in Washington, D.C. is located in a W.R.C. building, which we participated in its Covid-19 protocol and with all members of our staff at our headquarters in Washington, D.C.
Starting last week, our office in Washington, D.C. has moved to a completely distant place according to the joint guidance with our San Francisco office.
As some of our colleagues know at our headquarters in New York City, we have discussed renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed for some time.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our long-term remote colleagues know that it might be an adjustment, and they want to give you some advice:
The meeting time should be set for a maximum of one hour or by a gradual increase of up to two hours.
If it requires longer sessions, you should think about how to divide them over several days.
The meeting should be clearly defined, an agenda prepared, and materials for reading in advance.
Videos should make the virtual solution, and use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate cooperation and direct communication.
The initiative should facilitate each meeting, monitor the conversation to find out the questions and track the list of speakers, and someone else to help document the observations (or carry out the process of blogging collaborative observations).
An email should be sent to technical support when necessary to comfortable headphones.
The health and safety compensation program can be used for the cost of snacks.
#remoties channel can be joined in the Slack app to talk to colleagues about distributed work
The Human Resources Operations Team is looking for guidance for user-friendly elements based on online meetings, to support the increase in business distributed across our organization.
Over the past week, we have asked all community grant holders to cancel all public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the events of web editors Editathon until the World Health Organization announces the end of the pandemic.
We told them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete agreed grant activities, and that no fines will be imposed on anyone due to the need to delay or modify these goals.
Next week, we will issue additional follow-up guidance on Wikimedia and other regional community conferences with specific themes.
Public feelings that prevail in the world community are frustrated by the unrest, the satisfaction with clarity and the ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia and others.
In light of the past, the crisis response team is designing a page in Meta Wiki to provide space for society to monitor the impact and follow up all contacts with it.
Stay informed about the issues associated with COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar on Thursday, at 14:00 p.m., at 07:00 p.m. Pacific time for the working group meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer questions and spend time communicating with us.
We are experiencing this experience together and are always ready to help as much as possible.
In the meantime, we can continue to obtain information from this email, and all other necessary information about the COVID-19 available in Ovis Wiki.
The Crisis Response Team will keep these pages up-to-date and keep all information in one place.
We are also working on continuing regular contacts with highly affected State workers.
If you have any questions about travel, events, key business areas, coverage challenges or anything else you need help with, please feel free to inform us and cooperate with the crisis response team.
We are always ready to provide support and communication as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive issue, please send an email to Brian Goden, Director of International Human Resources Operations.
No change of these changes may be considered to be free of our work or obligations.
Instead, it is a recognition at this moment that our work and our commitments are in a much-needed need to adapt to the situation in a way we have not been entrusted in the past.
We believe these steps are necessary to support each other, so we can continue to work and provide our employees with the support they need, and provide the world with the service they depend on.
The work we have planned to achieve will be waiting for us when it is time to complete it.
Now, it is time for each person to help each other and create an important work space that comes within the coming weeks and months to come.
We all need you to do this, so we all need you to take care of yourself and your families to be in your best condition when your efforts are missed.
Please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Catherine, Director of the Crisis Response Team (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J., Doren D., Gregory V, Jimmy V, Willel, Lennet L, Ryan M.M., Tony S), and other members of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W., Jimmy V, Jean-Yu, Lisa S, Robin A., Ryan E.M., and Toby In).
Angiotensin 2 convert enzyme (ACE2) is associated with the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, lungs, heart, kidney, as well as the intestine.
Angiotensin convert enzyme 2 is an enzyme that converts angiotensin (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin 2 and increasing angiotensin (1-7); making it a promising drug in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. It also enters certain types of coronavirus into cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 convertor enzyme is known as an enzyme that contains zinc element and is located on the surface of the lining cells and other cells.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme protein 2 has a peptide M2 layer, and a cholecaterine-cropoxyle chain is a transporter for renal amino acids.
Angiotensin 2 convertor enzyme is a single-type 1 membrane protein, and has active enzyme receptors found on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The outer part of the cell range of the angiotensin 2 convertor enzyme is separated from the ophthalmic domain by an enzyme called chemaz, resulting in the release of soluble protein into the bloodstream and then released by urine.
Angiotensin 2 is present in most organs of the body: it is associated with the cell membrane of type 2 senchial cells in the lungs, in the intestinal cells of the small intestines, and in the lining cells of the arteries and veins, as well as in the muscle cells of the intestinal wall in most organs.
Repozy DNA is the source of the enzyme convertible to angiotensin 2 found in the brain coronavirus, the scheme, the area under the atherosclerosis, and the brain stem.
The essential enzyme function of angiotensin 2 is to work as a balance for angiotensin converting enzyme.
Angiotensin converting enzyme induces the conversion of Angiotensin 1 into Angiotensin 2 vessels.
In contrast, the angiotensin convertor enzyme 2 is separated from Alanin-Alanin 2 (Aspartite-Argenin-Falen-Tierosin-Isoliosin-Hestene-Prolin-Penyl-Alanin) and analysed by a converter to Angiotensin (1-7), (Hestin-Asperit-Argene-Valen-Tierosin-Aisoliosin-Histden-Prolin-Penel-Alanin).
Angiotensin convertor enzyme 2 is separated into a number of other peptides, including [des-Argenin9]-Brandrikinin, Ablin, neurotinsin, Dinorfen A, and Gerlin.
Angiotensin 2 convertor enzyme also regulates the prognosis of a neutral transporter of SLC6A19 amino acids, and also plays a role in Harttenb's disease.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, as a ophthalmic protein, is the main accessory to cells for certain coronaviruses, which include Human Coronavirus NL63, SARS Coff (the virus that causes SARS), and SARS Cof-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the binding of the Spiek S1 protein to the SARS Cove virus and SARS Cof-2 with the enzyme range of the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme on the cell surface leads to cellular recombination, the transmission of the virus and the enzyme to the internal particles that are located in the cells.
This introduction requires the creation of a S protein by a membrane-based protase enzyme, a host-specific Serin2, whose inhibitor is still under trial as a possible treatment. This makes some assume that reducing the levels of the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme in cells may help to resist infection.
In any case, many specialized associations and self-organizing bodies recommend that they continue to use the converting enzyme inhibitors of the usual angiotensin and angiotensin receptors as a treatment.
A methodology and analysis study published on July 11, 2012 showed that the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors was accompanied by a clear reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the reference group.
Moreover, the risk of pneumonia among those who received treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, who were more at risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke or heart failure, has decreased.
The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has led to a decrease in the proportion of deaths caused by pneumonia, although the results were less powerful than the overall risk of pneumonia.
The converting enzyme of human damaged angiotensin 2 (rhACE2) is believed to be a new treatment for acute lung injury, it has been found to improve the process of distribution of pulmonary blood, as well as the saturated oxygen in pigs with severe respiratory distress syndrome initiated by multiple fat sugars.
The half-life of the enzyme converting angiotensin 2 damaged is approximately 10 hours, while its work starts after 30 minutes, as well as its effectiveness (time period) continues until 24 hours.
There are many signs that the converted enzyme of the damaged angiotensin 2 may be a promising treatment for those with intolerance to conventional angiotensin-system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors), and in diseases associated with elevated Angiotensin 2 in the blood. There are clinical trials under assessment, about the effect of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme pump damaged in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Covid-19 apps are specially designed software applications to help track people who are involved in responding to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, meaning the process of identifying people (malignant) who may be infected by a person.
Many applications have been designed or proposed with official government support in some regions and areas of jurisdiction.
Many frameworks have been developed to design apps to track mixers.
Many have expressed their concerns about privacy, especially about systems that rely on tracking the geographical location of app users.
Less-infringed privacy alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record near the user from other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced they might integrate a function that supports these Bluetooth-based apps, directly into Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has published an application that allows citizens to check whether they have been given people with COVID-19 or not.
It is an app used by individuals in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, individuals use an app called TraceTogether.
A local information technology association has designed the app, released it as an open source app and is due to be delivered to the government. North Macedonia has launched the App - StopKorona - a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to the mix of potential infected individuals and provide a quick response to health care authorities.
The Ministry of Communications and Technology, in cooperation with the Ministry of Health, has taken over the design of the application.
On April 14, 2020, the app was still waiting for the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government reported that the mixing tracking app was in the advanced development phase, and could become available for distribution within weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are considering designing apps based on the Singapore-launched TrackTogether app, as well as the Blue Tris Protocol. Russia intends to introduce an app that uses the geographical virtual ocean for patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 from residents of Moscow, which is designed to make sure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, has mentioned a number of possible practical problems surrounding app-based systems, including false positive cases and a potential lack of effectiveness if the use of apps is limited to only a small sector of the population.
To deal with concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful coronavirus apps, Apple has imposed restrictions on the types of organizations that can add its own coronavirus-related apps to its app store; this has limited it to official or other organizations only of good reputation.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the consequences of collective surveillance resulting from the use of coronavirus apps, particularly as to whether the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will disappear immediately or not.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
Eight conditions for government projects have also been announced by organizations:
Monitoring should be legal, necessary and proportionate;
Monitoring and control extensions should include items relating to the timing of their cessation;
The use of data should be limited to purposes relating to Covid-19;
Data security and confidentiality should be protected and protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid increased discrimination and marginalisation;
Any sharing of data with third parties to the law should be determined;
Protection against abuse and protection of citizens ' rights should be provided to address abuses;
Effective participation is required from all relevant stakeholders, including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Greenen) (RSF) have also issued reviews.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to deal with the ongoing monitoring problem by removing the tracking mechanism from device operating systems as soon as necessary.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of using apps, eliminating both the need to download the app and allowing tracking to be avoided.
In Israel, officials adopted network-based tracking.
Network-based solutions that have access to the initial data of the sites, however, have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal site data; a number of privacy-maintenance systems that use central servers have been established only for inter-internet communications (see section below).
In South Korea, officials have used a non-app-based system to carry out mixing tracking.
Instead of using a custom application, the system collects tracking information from different sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and includes these data to send notifications via text messages to individuals with potential infections.
In addition to using this information to alert potential mixers, the government also made site information publicly available, allowing it due to extensive changes in information privacy laws after the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public via a number of apps and websites. Countries, including Germany, have considered using central and privacy-maintaining systems.
On April 6, 2020, details on this have not yet been published.
On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts worked to reach privacy-friendly solutions, such as low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to register near the user of other cell phones.
However, BIB-PT has been a coordinating effort that contains both central and decentralized approaches, not an individual protocol. decentralization-based protocols include the tracking of privacy-maintenance decentralization approaches (DPB/DCP-3T), TCNs, previously known as CPNs, privacy-sensitive protocols, and BCTs and others.
In these protocols, personal identification data do not leave the device, and all matching processes occur on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-maintenance technologies when collecting or interrupting site data and using them to track the spread of COVID-19.
It depends on the research benefited from the report - The evil face of applications: the preservation of personal privacy under the epidemic - issued in March 2020. Enigma MPC’s SafeTrace platform, a privacy technology development company that originally originated in MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure device technologies to allow users to share sensitive website and health data with users and other officials without prejudice to data privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the Global Contact Numbers Tracking Coalition was founded by groups that focused their attention on what was a similar approach in the basis of highly overlapping protocols, whose goal was to reduce the dispersal and enable global exchange between tracking and alert applications, a key feature for widespread use.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced it had made the Blue Tris protocol, which is used by the official government app, open the source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the two companies that control Android and iOS mobile operating systems, announced an initiative to track mixers, claiming they will maintain privacy by relying on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technologies and privacy-maintained encryption.
They also published the main technical specifications used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the goal is to put the system in three stages:
Offering tools to enable governments to create official privacy-maintained apps to track Coronavirus
Integrate this function directly into Android and iOS as Google and Apple plan to solve ongoing use and monitoring problems by first distributing systems through operating system updates and then removing them the same way as soon as the threat ends.
The re-utilization of the property (also known as re-use, re-assignment, or change of purpose or therapeutic transformation) is a re-determination of the use of approved drug to treat a different disease or medical condition that was designed to be treated originally.
This is a method of scientific research currently followed by researchers to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research trends include the development of a Covid-19 vaccine and the transfer of quinoxin plasma. The SARS Cof-2 virus contains approximately 66 drug-treated proteins, each of which contains multi-linked sites.
Analysis of these sites provides a reasonable plan for the development of an effective antivirus drug that eliminates Covid-19 proteins.
Among the very important SARS Cof-2 target proteins are the two-protease, the Repozy DNA polymerase based on Repozy DNA, the halicase, the S protein, and the repophosphatase phosphatase of diphosphatase.
Hussain A, and others have studied several candidate compounds that were subsequently subject to improvement and analysis of their structure with approved drugs of the highest similarity to this in order to accelerate the development of a strong anti-SARS Cof-2 drug in their preclinical study to recommend it in the design of a clinical study.
Fluoroquin is a medicine to treat malaria that doctors also use to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, a World Health Organization announced that chloroquine and associated chloroquine could be among four studied drugs as part of the clinical solidarity experience.
New York Governor Andrew Como announced that New York State experiences on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could start on March 24. On March 28, the Food and Drug Administration stated that the use of sulfate is based on the use of chloroquine and phosphate under the emergency use license (EUA).
Treatment was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration’s clinical trials and was licensed under an emergency use license only as an emergency emergency treatment for patients who entered the hospital but are unable to receive treatment in the clinical trial.
CDC has announced that it has not yet been identified - the use of hydroxychloroquin to prevent, treat, or treat SARS COF-2 infection, dosages or period.
Doctors said they were using the drug when there was no other choice.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is currently conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine as well as zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University Langon School of Medicine conducts an experiment on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of chloroquin hydroxide.
China's clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed that Vitiperavier was \"clearly effective\".
Of the 35 patients in Shenzhen, the test results were negative in an average of 4 days, while the disease period was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of them were given vatiperavier and the other half received Omifovir.
The Italian Agency for Drugs has warned people that the existing evidence supporting the drug is missing and primary.
On April 2, Germany announced it would buy the property from Japan to include it in its reserve stock, and it would use the army to deliver the property to university hospitals, where the property would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to South China's morning newspaper, Shinzo Abe has had preliminary talks with the Trump administration about buying the property. The drug may be less influential in treating the most severe cases where the virus is already doubled.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women who wish to get pregnant.
One of the studies that used Lupinavier/Ritonavier (Calitra), a combination of antivirus combinations, stated that the results had not been tracked for any benefit.
Drugs were designed to inhibit HIV to prevent it from copying it into protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to reach a compound associated with the SARS Cof-2. The scientific community is witnessing a state of criticism about directing resources to redefin the purposes of drugs specifically designed to treat HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) added to the experience of international solidarity.
Gilead Sciences has developed the drug Remdesvere as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences has then discovered that Remdesfir is actively anti-virusing in the laboratory against many fertilized viruses, mutant viruses and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through transformations that can lead to more serious diseases and transmission.
Some early preclinical studies suggest that the drug may be characterized by a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are many existing multiple clinical trials, including two trials conducted by University of Cleveland hospitals, one about middle-aged patients, and one for patients with the most severe disease.
There are three clinical trials of antivirus vitamin C on patients who have entered the hospital with a severe disease due to COVID-19, as well as two controlled trials using a fake drug (China, Canada) and a non-controllable trial (Italy).
New York State began experiments on the effect of Azithromycin on 24 March 2020.
The National Center for Public Health and Medicine (NCM) is planning to carry out a clinical trial on the use of alvesco (Seclonide), produced by Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid to treat asthma, to treat patients infected with the new coronavirus prior to the onset of symptoms.
The second phase is currently being tested using a form of angiotensin 2 convertor enzyme on 200 patients who are required to join the trial of acute cases that have entered the hospital in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicin in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called Colkrona, includes 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms without the need for hospitalization.
Pregnant or breast-feeding women who do not have an effective method of contraception are not qualified.
Many antioxidants are also tested in Italy.
The low molecular weight heparin is currently widely used to treat patients, which requires the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidance on its use.
A multicenter study in Italy has been announced on 300 patients to study the use of Inoxaparin sodium at doses of disease prevention and therapeutic doses on April 14.
Since SARS COV-2 is a virus, scientific attention has been focused on the re-use of approved antivirus drugs designed to deal with previous outbreaks such as March, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Rebafrin: Specialists recommended using Rebafrin for Covid-19 treatment according to 7th version of Chinese guidelines
Omifenfir: Specialists recommended Omifenfir for Covid-19 treatment according to Chinese 7th edition
Some antibiotics that identified specialists as likely to be reusable as Covid-19 treatments include:
Tosilizomap (receiving anti-interlockin 6): approved by China.
Experiences in Italy and China also. See Tosilizomap#COVID-19.
The Covid-19 vaccine is a supposed vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no clinical trials have been completed, there are many attempts being made to develop this vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-Coff-2, a contagious virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
There were five candidate vaccines in the first phase of safety studies in April.
Kovid-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak has spread around the world in 2020, leading to large investments and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many published genomes are used to develop potential vaccines against SARS-COV-2.
The requirements of the Coalition's initiative on pandemic preparedness for vaccine development, which was announced in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale dissemination and global access.
In April, Coalition scientists for Epidemiology Innovations reported that 10 different technical platforms were under research and development in early 2020 to establish an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of the platform presented to the first phase of safety studies include:
Nuclear acid (degenerated Rebose DNA and Rebose DNA) (stage 1 developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
The viral carrier (Phase 1 developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, type 5 coronavirus carrier)
According to Coalition scientists for Epidemiology Innovations in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (79, according to the Melkin Institute), and 37 other projects are announced, but with little public information available (supposed to be in planning or being designed).
The first and second phase experience is conducted with an initial safety and deafness test, usually random, and is controlled by children and in multiple locations, with more accurate and effective doses determined.
Phase 3 trials usually include a greater number of participants, including the reference group, and a test for vaccine effectiveness to prevent the disease, while monitoring the adverse effects of the optimal dose.
Of 79 active development candidates (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 are not yet under human evaluation (still under research - before clinical).
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the likelihood of a molecular-racking vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins in order to stimulate an immune reaction.
On approximately 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Sakashuan announced the start of the vaccine, where testing is aimed at starting in humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at Hong Kong University on January 28.
On January 29, 2020, the pharmaceutical companies Janssen, led by Hanky Shuitmaker, announced that they had begun working on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is involved in the development of an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a study on the design of a vaccine with technology similar to that used to treat cancer with an emerging vaccine.
On March 25, the head of the Research Institute announced that they had finished manufacturing the vaccine and that they had begun testing.
On February 27, 2020, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, Generex’s company, announced that it had begun a vaccine project to create Ii-Key peptide vaccine against Covid-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine that could be tested in humans within 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the U.S. Army Command for Medical Research and Equipment at Fort Derrick and the Walter Red Military Research Institute at Silver Spring, both in Western Maryland, announced they were working on a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced that they formed a team with Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
Partners also announced pre-clinical test plans and phase 1 clinical experience by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolated cases, and that even as the pace of work accelerates, it would take at least a year and a half to nearly two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company in Quebec, said it was a major development similar to the coronavirus in part funded by Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The vaccine is subject to laboratory research, with testing plans in humans in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac - large amounts of money - to reach exclusive access to the Kovid-19 vaccine, which the German government protested.
On March 17, 2020, US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German BioNTech company to participate in the development of a reusable reusable DNA-based vaccine.
The Repoise DNA-based vaccine is currently undergoing preclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would get test results before clinical trials in April 2020 and the vaccine could start the final candidate with tests in humans by autumn.
In France on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemiology Innovations (CBA) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a research union for Kovid-19 vaccine, which includes the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vina, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which prompted the total investment of the Alliance of Epidemiological Innovations in the development of Kovid-19 vaccine to US$29 million.
The partners of the Coalition for Epidemiology Preparations for the Development of Covid-19 vaccine are Modernna, Curevac, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing in animals for six different candidate vaccines.
On March 20, 2020, researchers at Imperial College London announced that they were developing a self-inflated reusicic acid vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of $275 million for 96 research projects on anti-covid-19 medical measures, including many candidate vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and the University of Sakashuan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced Canadian$192 million specifically for the development of the Kovid-19 vaccine, with plans to create a national vaccine bank from several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Petersburg Medical School reported tests for PittCoVacc, a potential Covid-19 vaccine in mice, stating that the S1 subunit vaccines of SARS-Coff-2 that were administered with microbinar generated strong responses to specific antibodies [in mice] were clear from 2 weeks after vaccination.
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo College of Pharmacy announced the design of a vaccine for a vaccine based on a DNA-structural DNA-structed vaccine as a possible nasal spray.
Using anaesthetics, DNA will be designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to the virus, which may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to SARS-COV-2.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities gathered resources to access IBM giant computers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, also called undefined effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the disease they are struggling with.
Another random experience in Australia seeks to register 4,170 healthcare workers.
The vaccines being developed are likely to not be safe or effective.
Early research to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine using specific animal models for COVID-19, such as genetically modified mice with angiotensin 2 convertible enzyme, other laboratory animals, and non-human women, indicates the need for measures to contain level 3 biological safety to deal with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure uniform safety procedures.
Anti-SARS vaccines and Middle East respiratory syndrome have been tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or preventive vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no approved vaccine against Middle East respiratory syndrome.
When March spread, it was believed that research around SARS could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and treatments against March-Coff infection.
As of March 2020, there was one vaccine of Middle East respiratory syndrome (based on DNA) that completed the first phase of clinical trials in humans, three other vaccines under development, all of which were HIV-oriented vaccines, two influenza-like vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vaccine-oriented MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media has raised the conspiracy theory that the virus of COVID-19 was known and that the vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by many social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequence and vaccines for other strains of coronaviruses such as SARS-induced coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a coronavirus-related severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS Coff-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat inflammation, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
The period between exposure to injury and symptom onset is usually about five days, but may range from two to 14 days.
Although most cases show mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million people were reported injured in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus mainly spreads between people during mixing, often through coughing, sneezing, or talking.
When spraying occurs during the fertilization process, it usually falls on the ground or on the surfaces rather than being enemy over remote distances.
People may also get hurt when they touch a contaminated surface and then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is the most common infection in the first three days of the onset of symptoms, although it may spread before the onset of symptoms and in late stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the sequence polymerase interaction of the RTR-BCR through an anatomical swab.
It is recommended to use masks for those suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers.
The recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, some authorities recommend that they not be used, some see otherwise, and that they should be used.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
You may not show symptoms on people with the virus or show flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Instant medical care is advised if emergency symptoms appear: difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest area, disorder, difficulty waking, or thinning of the face or lips.
In less common cases, symptoms of the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, sylan of the nose or inflammation may be observed.
Symptoms of the digestive system such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying proportions.
At first, some cases in China have suffered from chest tightness and failure only.
In some, the disease may develop to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the nursery period.
Covid-19 is usually five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who show symptoms will do this within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of disease carriers has not yet been fully recognized without symptoms of infection transmission; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people with no symptoms is currently unknown and is under study, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCD) reported that 20% of the total confirmed cases did not show symptoms during their hospital stay.
China’s National Health Committee began to list non-symptomatic cases within the daily output on April 1; of the 166 cases on that day, 130 (78%) of these cases did not show symptoms on the test.
The language and games may carry a large proportion of the virus.
It results in louder noise than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without oral coverage could lead to spraying spreads of up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually transmitted by air, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that it can be transmitted by bio-air debris, and testing of samples of air complexes located in the restaurant outside the individual rooms has resulted in positive results for viral virology DNA.
Some medical procedures such as tubing and pulmonary cardiac recovery (CPR) may cause respiratory discharges to be released as a spray, and then the virus is spread via the air.
Although there are concerns that it may spread by feces, it is believed that this risk is limited.The virus is more infectious when people suffer from symptoms; while it may spread before symptoms occur, the risk is less.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that despite some uncertainty about how easily the disease spreads, one person can be prepared from two to three people in general. The virus remains stuck on surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be present for one day on reinforced paper and up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on copper 99%.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and frieds are also effective provided they are used properly; soap works to dissipate the virus’s protective fatty membrane and stop its work, as well as remove the skin and other surfaces from it.
Other solutions, such as Benzalconium chloride and chlorhexide glucoseate, are available with less effectiveness.In a study in Hong Kong, samples of toys were taken two days after the average transport to the hospital.
In five of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and on the second day of the test, the sixth patient had the highest viral load.
Coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS Cof-2) is a novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome, where, for the first time, three people with pneumonia were isolated from the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
The new SARS Cof-2 virus shares its characteristics with the related coronavirus found in nature.
Outside of the body, home soap spends on the virus, destroying its protective membrane. SARS Coff-2 is closely associated with the original SARS Coff.
The two organs are the most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters host cells by the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2), which is the most abundant in type II senchial cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface sugar protein called Spyke (Folve Coin) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
12% of people who have been hospitalized in Wuhan, China, have suffered severe heart attacks, and are more likely to have serious cases.
Heart and vascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the development of the disease, but acute heart muscle injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACI2’s futures have a very important role in the heart and participate in the performance of its functions.
The rate of seizures (31%) and peripheral blood clots (25%) in patients in the Intensive Care Unit with COVID-19 has risen which may be associated with poor predictability of the underlying condition.
Although SARS-COV-2 is directed towards the epithelium cells expressed in the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 suffer from symptoms of hyperinitis.
In particular, T cells that secrete the disease-induced GSF are found to be associated with the bringing of the only cells that secrete interferon 6 causing inflammation and osteoarthritis in COVID-19 patients.
It was also reported that there was osteoarthritis at the time of body surgery.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The sequence polymerase reaction of RTR-BC is the standard method of testing.
The test is usually carried out using respiratory samples taken from an nose swab; however, a nasal swab or sample can also be used in a language.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but this requires taking two blood samples by two weeks and the results are of simple direct value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and spread genetic sequence so laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase reaction tests (BCR) to detect HIV infection.
On 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infection and whether a person has been injured in the past or not) were under development, but have not yet been widely used.
China’s test experience showed that accuracy ranges from 60 to 70 percent.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first clinical care point test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines issued by Chungenan Hospital at Wuhan University proposed ways to detect infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
The double-sided glass valves with an oceanal, non-like spread and a backside of common features at the beginning of the injury.
A spread may appear under my side and form a stone resuscitation (the thickness of the scavenger barrier with an unsound senchie fill) and integrate with the development of the disease.
A few data are available on Covid-19’s pathology and micropestology.
Main satisfactory findings of body surgery:
Microsurgery: anaesthetic inflammation, myelitis, lung inflation and pulmonary osteoarthritis
Four types of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperbacterosis of lung cells, large non-typical senchial cells, and inflammation within me with sterilization of my glands and formation of multiple giant nucleic cells
Rheumatitis: Singhi Dispersion (DAD) damage with spread senchitis.
Singhi damage is caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (RRS) and severe hypoxia.
Treatment of pneumonia: regulation of discharges in senchrome and pneumonia
Blood: intravascular exudates (DIC); reaction of white blood cells
Prevention measures to reduce the chances of staying home include avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, exercising good hygiene of the respiratory tract, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with an alternative when coughing or sneezing, and recommends using the interior part of the facility if there is no alternative.
It is recommended to clean your hands well after any cough or thirst.
CDC recommended the use of cloth face coverings in public places, in part aimed at reducing non-symptomatic transmission of infection. Social distancing strategies aim at reducing the mixing of large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and eliminating large public gatherings.
The Privacy Guidelines also include that people stay away from each other at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away.
There is no known drug for its effectiveness in preventing COVID-19. Because no vaccine innovation is expected until 2021 at the earliest, the main part of COVID-19 control is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is known as the curve.
CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are washed clearly, before eating, and after cleaning your nose, cough or sneezing.
It also recommends using an alcohol-containing hand sanitizer of at least 60%, when soap and water are not available only. For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO offers two local production installations.
Anti-microbial activity arises in these two formulations of ethanol or isopropanol.
hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacteria in alcohol; it is not an effective material for hand cleansing.
Add glycerol as a moisturizer.
People get supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and other affected vital organs subsidies.
CDC recommends that those suspected of being infected with the virus wear a simple face mask.
Bacteria are used outside the body (EMO) to address the problem of respiratory failure, but their benefits are still under study.
Personal hygiene is recommended and based on a lifestyle and a healthy diet for HIV.
Supportive treatments may benefit those with mild symptoms during the early stage of the infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the China National Health Commission (WHO) have published recommendations to care for those who have been hospitalized due to COVID-19.
Intensive care professionals and U.S. lung disease professionals collected treatment recommendations from various bodies in a free supplier, a critical case care book available online.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 was available.
For symptoms, some doctors specialize in the use of paracetamol (astamine) rather than ibuprofen as the first treatment.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings when carrying out procedures that may result in spraying, such as apnea or manual breathing.
For healthcare professionals taking care of people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that a person be placed in the air-borne infection isolation room (IIIR) as well as using standard precautions, mixing precautions and air-borne disease precautions.
Recommended tools: personal protective equipment, breathing device or face mask, eye shields, and medical gloves. Preferably use breathing devices (instead of face masks) if available.
The N95 respirators were adopted for industrial facilities, but the Food and Drug Administration has stated using masks under the Emergency Use License (EOA).
They are designed to protect from air-borne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a particular biological agent is uncertain in case of uses other than for non-specific purposes.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields, or homemade masks as the last solution.
The most serious cases of COVID-19 are not as deteriorating as they require industrial breathing or alternatives, but some cases need to be done.
The type of respiratory support provided to people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure for hospital patients is actively studied, with some evidence of the possibility of avoiding the pipeline using high flow nasal canal or two-level positive pressure for the airway.
It is not known whether either option would benefit those with a critical condition or not.
Some doctors prefer to continue using gas industrial breathing when available because this technique limits the spread of waste particles compared to high-flow nasal canals.
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds for the population, restricting the health system’s ability to cope with the sudden rise in the number of dangerous COVID-19 cases that require hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% of cases were introduced into intensive care units, 2.3% needed industrial respiratory support, and 1.4% died.
In China, nearly 30% of those transferred to hospitals because of COVID-19 eventually enter intensive care units.
Industrial breathing becomes more complex with the development of RDS in people with COVID-19 and oxygen supply becomes more difficult.
Breathers need to have high-positive pressure control conditions and end-of-life pressure to maximize oxygen delivery while reducing the risk of lung injury associated with the respiratory system and septics to the lowest degree.
High positive end pressure may not be available in old breathing devices.
The search for possible treatments began in January 2020, and many anti-viral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesfir seems to be the most popular.
Although new drugs may take up to 2021 to develop, many drugs that are tested have already received approval for other uses or are already at an advanced stage of testing.
Antivirus drugs can be tried for those with a critical pathology.
WHO recommended volunteers to participate in trials on the effectiveness and safety of possible treatments. The Food and Drug Administration has granted a temporary license to use purity plasma as an experimental remedy in cases where a person’s life is seriously or directly threatened.
It has not been subjected to clinical studies to prove that it is safe and effective against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are required to enter the name and ID number.
The app can detect ‘malignant’ using surveillance data and therefore the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-health quarantine, but also alerts local health officials. Huge data analysis of mobile data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected and mixed in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to track mobile phone data for those supposed to be infected with Coronavirus.
Action has been taken to impose quarantines and protect those who are likely to mix with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared phone data collected with the German federal agency, the Robert Koch Institute, for research and prevention of the spread of the virus.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to detect quarantiners.
Italy's regional health Commissioner, Mr. Giulio Galera, said mobile companies told him that 40 percent of people are still moving everywhere.
The German government conducted a 48-hour holiday with more than 42,000 people.
The President of Estonia, Ms. Kirsty Calleolide, also made a global call for innovative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may feel narrowed by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of injury itself.
BBC has published an article to Rory O'Connor - increasing social isolation, unity, anxiety about health, stress and economic recession is a great storm that harms people's mental health and well-being.
The disease may take a light cycle involving mild or no symptoms, where it is similar to other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract such as ankles.
Simple cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and Meers, but there is still a lack of data on COVID-19.COVID-19 may affect the lungs in some people due to pneumonia.
Covid-19 may develop in the most rapidly affected to acute respiratory distress syndrome (RRS), leading to respiratory failure, mental shock or multi-member failure.
The complications associated with COVID-19 are encephalitis, abnormal blood clots, heart, kidney and liver damage.
Six percent of people with COVID-19 who were transferred to the hospital were diagnosed with hypertension, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, while 4 percent observed kidney dysfunction.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 had elevated levels of liver enzymes.
According to the same report, the average period between symptoms and death was 10 days, five days in the hospital.
However, the average period for those transferred to the intensive care unit between hospital and death was seven days.
In an early case study, the average period from the onset of primary symptoms to death was 14 days, and reached a total of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NCHC) in China, men's mortality rate was 2.8%, while women's mortality was 1.7%.
Pathological surgical examinations of lung samples after death show widespread senkhic damage with cellular virbromoxide secretions in both lungs.
Changes in viral disease have been observed in senchial cells.
The lung image shows acute respiratory distress syndrome (RRS).
Heart damage was observed due to high levels of troponin or heart attack in 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China.
According to data from the United States in March, 89% of those transferred to the hospital were suffering from previous pathological conditions.
Estimates of mortality resulting from the situation vary as a result of those differences between regions, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The reduced limitation of simple cases may increase the estimated proportion of deaths from the truth.
However, the fact that previous deaths are caused may indicate that the current mortality rate is lower than the reality.
Smokingrs are 1.4 times more likely to suffer from acute Covid-19 symptoms and 2.4 times more likely to die than non-smokers.
Hong Kong Hospital has revealed a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some patients with the disease, and lung tests indicate damage.
This may also cause post-care syndrome after healing.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether or not the previous infection was making recovery from the disease effective and long-term immunity.
Immunity is seen as a potential, based on other coronavirus behaviour, but it was announced that there were cases of COVID-19 and was later infected.
These cases are thought to be worsening if the infection continues more than once repeated.
The virus is believed to be natural and has animal origin, given the spread of infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was largely due to its human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that December 1, 2019 is the first date for the onset of symptoms.
Official publications from the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that December 8, 2019 is the first date for the onset of symptoms.
Many actions are usually taken to determine the number of deaths.
These figures vary by region and over time and are influenced by the size of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, and the time taken since the onset of the disease outbreak and the characteristics of the population such as age, sex and public health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) allocated in the 10th review of the International Disease Classification Emergency Code 07.1 the confirmed SARS Cof-2 infection deaths and the U07.2 for COVID-19 deaths diagnosed with SARS Coff-2 in a clinical or epidemiological manner without confirmation of the virus infection. The proportion of deaths from injuries reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of reported cases during a given period of time.
Based on Johns Hopkins’ statistics, the global number of deaths from injuries is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the CFR mortality rate, which reflects the percentage of those who have been detected and died due to disease, and the IFR mortality rate, which reflects the percentage of infected people (who have been detected and who have not been detected) and who have died from a disease.
These statistics do not have a time frame, nor do they follow a specific population group from an injury even to knowledge of the fate of the situation.
Although antibodies may not be produced by all infected bodies, their presence may provide information about the number of people infected.
At Italy’s centre of disease, Castelion de Ada, a small village of 4600 people, 80 people already died (1.7%).
In Gangelt, the disease spread due to Carnival festivals, moving to young people, causing a relatively lower mortality rate, and possibly not all COVID-19 deaths were officially classified as a result of it.
Moreover, the German health system has not been violated.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, according to an assessment by donors in blood.
The death of 69 (0.004% of the population) was confirmed due to COVID-19.
The impact of the outbreak and the resulting mortality rate vary between men and women.
The mortality rate is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The maximum risk for men is 50 years of age, with the difference between men and women at 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of these sexual differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioural factors may be a cause.
Gender-based immune differences, non-proliferation of smoking between women and men may have contributed to simultaneous pathological conditions such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women.
In Europe, 57% of men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track data disaggregated by sex for COVID-19 injuries.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
The highest percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have increased risk of HIV infection.
WHO announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is Covid-19.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Gibrisos explained that Ko is short of Corona, and in a short summary of the virus and a brief summary of the disease, and 19 refers to the first year of detection of the outbreak: December 31, 2019.
Choose the name to avoid referring to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in line with international label recommendations aimed at preventing stigmatization.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS Coff-2).
In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO) uses the words \"COVID-19\" and \"COVID-19\" in public data.
Disease and virus are usually referred to as coronavirus.
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease was commonly referred to as the Coronavirus, the Coronavirus, and the virus.
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of the new 2019 novel coronavirus and the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease as temporary names for the virus and the disease, according to 2015 guidelines that prevent the use of sites in the names of diseases and viruses.
The two official names were issued by Kovid-19 and SARS COF-2 on February 11, 2020.
Due to limited capacity in standard supply chains, digital industrial companies issue health care materials such as nose swabs and respiratory parts.
One example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver in time, a local startup reversed its engineering and released the 100 valves required in one night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories and false information emerged regarding the origin, scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and rapidly spread online.
Humans seem to be able to transport the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of virus proliferation in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines for the treatment of the disease.
Government institutions, academic groups and industry researchers conduct international research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a solidarity experiment to assess the therapeutic effects of four anti-viral compounds that are best effective.
No vaccine is available, but different bodies are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Previous studies about SARS Coff are used because SARS Cof-2 is similar to using ACI2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under study.
First, researchers aim to create a complete vaccine for the virus.
Using such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to provoke an immediate immune response in the human body against a new infection with COVID-19.
The second strategy, for micro-unit vaccination, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to some of the virus’s microunits.
In the case of SARS COF-2, this research focuses on the SpykeS protein that helps the virus penetrate ACE2 receptors.
The third strategy is DNA vaccines (fact DNA vaccines or rebose DNA, a new vaccine innovation technique).
The experimental vaccines resulting from any of these strategies should be tested to ensure their safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of four volunteers in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code that is inherited from the virus that causes the disease.It is referred to the antibody-based stimulation as a potential challenge facing the innovation of the SARS Cof-2 vaccine, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials under way from April 2020.
Seven trials have already been conducted for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The proposed antiviral drugs to be re-used in the treatment of the new disease are most of the Chinese research, through nine phase III trials on Remdesfir across several countries and are scheduled to report their results by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and potential Covid-19 properties was conducted as of April 2020. Several existing antivirus properties are evaluated for Covid-19 treatment, including remdesphir, fluoroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lupinafir/Ritonavier and lupenafir/Tonafir combined with interferon beta.
There is preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of Remdesfir, as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are conducted in the United States, China, and Italy. Chlorocene, previously used for malaria treatment, is studied in China in February 2020 and has preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer review.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virus Research suggests that although a single gram dose is recommended, this dose's weakness is very dangerous and may cause death.
On 28 March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency license for chloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or omififir for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
Initial data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS Cof-2 in the laboratory.
Further study was recommended for the effect of nitrooxanide on organisms after demonstrating inhibition of the low concentration of SARS Cof-2. Studies have shown that the initial formation of protein Spyke by the TMRS2 Transmitter Cyrene Protase is necessary to enter SARS Cof-2 by interacting with the future of ACE2.
Studies of chloroquine and chloroquine with or without azithromycin involve major deficiencies that prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without further study. Oseltamifer SARS Cof-2 does not inhibit in the laboratory and does not have a known role in COVID-19 treatment.
The Cetokin storm may be one of the complications in the late stages of the acute COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquin may have anti-cytokin storm properties. China's National Health Committee Tosilizomap added to the guidelines for treatment after completing a small study.
Subject to the non-randomized phase 2 test at the national level in Italy, positive results have been shown in those with severe pathological conditions.
In addition to its use in the test of ferritin in the blood serum to identify cytokine storms, it aims to face such developments, which are believed to be the cause of death in some infected people.
The Department of Food and Antireceptor Medicine (INT-6), adopted the treatment of T cells that are receiving HYD, based on case studies to treat Cytokin’s release syndrome for non-responders to esterification, which has a different cause in 2017.
So far, there is no controlled evidence that Tosilizomap is an effective treatment of cytokine release syndrome.
The method of transferring the selected and concentrated antibodies produced by the CoV-19-responders is subject to those who need it to study as a non-vaccinated method of negative vaccination.
This strategy was tested on SARS and its results were not decisive.
The neutralization of the virus is the expected mechanism of action by which negative antibody therapy can act as a defence intermediary against SARS Cof-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cellular toxicity based on antibodies, blubber or both may be used.
There are other forms of negative treatment of antibodies, such as the use of single-stranded antibodies manufactured, under development.
The production of the serum of ejaculation, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies specific to this virus, can be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus Diseases, a range of related syndromes
Lee Wen Liang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, was subsequently injured and died of COVID-19 after raising attention to the spread of the virus.
