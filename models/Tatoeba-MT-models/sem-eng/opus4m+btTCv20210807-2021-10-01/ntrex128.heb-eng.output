Members of the Weils Parliament are afraid to look like pubs.
Some members of parliament were worried about the proposal that would change from AMs to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This fear arose following plans to change the name of the law house for Welsh Parliament.
Members of parliament across the political spectrum are concerned that this will be available to the public.
A member of the Labour Party said that his people were afraid that \"it would get worse with Twp and Pwp.\"
For readers outside of Wales: Wally, twp means stupid and pwp means pwp.
A parliamentary member of the Falid Kemari party said that all his members were “unsatisfied” and offered alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his friends \"open to proposals\" about name change, but noted that the name MWP (the head of the Walsh MP's) sounds very similar to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh W letter is similar to the expression of the letter and in English in the Yokshire accent.
The House of Representatives Committee, which currently formulates the legislation to change names, said: \"The final decision on every word of description regarding the names of the House of Representatives is of course the decision of the House members themselves.\"
The Wills Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh legislature the authority to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of the consultation with the public on the proposals, in which broad support was given to changing the House of Lawmakers' name to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the role of MPs (AMs), the committee recommended the Walsh MPs or the heads of WMPs, but the MWP option received most of the support in consulting with the public.
Members of the parliament offer alternative options, but the struggle to achieve a consensus may cause little headache to the committee’s chairman, Alain Jones, who is due to submit a draft legislation on the changes in the coming weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes in the manner of the work of the House of Lawmakers, including rules for the removal of members of parliament and the structure of the committee system.
The vote of members of Parliament is that they will eventually determine their title of office during the debate in legislation.
The citizens of Macedonia go to polls in a referendum with a change in the name of the state
Citizens will vote on Sunday on the question of whether to change their country name to \"the Republic of Northern Macedonia\"
The people's referendum is determined in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, in which there is a province called Macdonia.
Greece has long claimed that its neighbouring northern name is in line with the territory of Greece and back and opposed Macdonia's attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, who opposed the people's question about the name change, said he would ignore his results.
However, those who support the people’s referendum, including Prime Minister Zuran Zeyev, claim that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's church's bells are still present in the church's difficulties in the Harlem neighborhood.
According to Mr. Adams, \"The residents of the old neighborhood are told that there were once a bar and a church in every corner.\"
“There are no bars or churches today.
He said he could understand the disappearance of bars.
“The life of people today is different.”
Bars are no longer the neighborhood living room where people visit on a regular basis.
As for churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not survive for so long as the heads of the churches expect, \" sooner or later, they will find themselves again at the starting point.\"
According to him, the location of the churches will be captured by apartment buildings with shared houses that house non-type people who will help neighborhoods maintain their unique character.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “so this will make sense of the closure of these churches, because most people going through these apartments are unlikely to join these churches.”
The two churches were built by white faith communities, before Harlem became a neighborhood that most of its black inhabitants - the Community Metropolitan Church in 1870, and St. Martin 10 years later.
The white methodological faith community left in the 1930s.
A black faith community operating in the area became the owner of the building.
The Church of St. Martin moved to a black-believe community under priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a central shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
In 1939, a fire caused heavy damage to the building, but as part of the plans of the believers under priest Johnson to rebuild it, they invited the construction of the bell kermes.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson's father and son who inherited his place in St. Martin's Church, proudly called the \"the bells\" of the poor.
The expert who played in a July career called him another name: “Cultural treasure” and “historical tool that has no replacement”
The expert, Tipni Ing from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first bell clock to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who later played the biggest career in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Marrivether said that St. Martin's church didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin's Church over the past few months was a complex story of architects and contractors, some of whom were brought by the heads of the local church, and others by the Episcopal Bishops.
The meeting, which is the governing body of the community of believers consisting of local believers, wrote to the bishops in July a letter in which she shares her concerns that the bishops “try to roll the costs” to the assembly, although the assembly was not involved in recruiting the architects and contractors who sent the bishops.
Some of the believers complained about the lack of transparency by the bishops.
13-year-old boy's wound shark in dives to capture Lobsters
A 13-year-old shark hit a boy on Saturday while the boy ran out to capture Lobsters in California on the first day of the lobby season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beicon Beach in Acinintas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had saved friends from this about an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy cry for help and then went there with a team to help put him on the beach.
Hammel initially thought a question was just shouting passionately at Lobster's capture, but then he realized that the boy cried \"I've been bitten!
I was biting!”
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he saw that \"his entire escape was gone.\"
I called everyone out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was sent to the Radi Hospital in San Diego where his condition is defined as human.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked the boy.
The rescue commander Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark was identified in a region a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous food shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Authorities closed access to the beach between Ponto Beach in Kasblad and Swaami Beach in Asinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to penetrate the beauty products market in the UK
Sainsbury's starts in competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and opens crossovers in a dog store style with professional sales women.
As part of a significant initiative to enter the UK’s beauty products market that will roll 2.8 billion pounds a year, which continues to grow as sales in fashion and home products are reduced, the extended transfer of beauty products will be checked in 11 stores across the country and if the experiment is successful, they will be added to other stores next year.
The investment in beauty products comes as components will pick up ways to use a shelf area previously captured by televisions, microwaves, and home products.
From Sainsbury's, the company is expected to double its beauty products offer to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time in its history.
existing product lines of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees companies will also be granted additional space with specific brand areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The product network also relaunches its makeup product line - Boutique - so that most of the products will be vegan-friendly, a feature that needs it growing among young buyers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop has tested franchises in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened in Crowden, South London last week, and the second will open at Sly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and moving to buy smaller amounts of food every day in local convenience stores requires you to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Kuul, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the branches would become more durable as the system of components is trying to fight against the cheap networks Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's added Argos's sales points to hundreds of stores as well as several Habitat Points since it bought both networks two years ago, adding that it said it raised the sale of container products and made purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts by the network to revive the beauty product departments and its pharmacies have ended in failure.
Sainsbury's attempted a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the connection ended after a dispute over how to split the profits from the pharmacies into the components.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold the business of pharmacies in 281 branches to Celsio, the owner of the pharmacies Loyds network for 125 million Tstriing three years ago.
She says Lloyds will play a role in the program, by expanding the brands of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Sainsbury’s commercial manager Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We have made a transformation in the look and feeling of our beauty product transitions, to improve the environment for customers.
In addition, we invested in highly trained workers who would be able to provide advice instead.
Our brands offer is designed to suit any need and our attractive environment and convenient locations make us an attractive destination for the purchase of beauty products, in a way that challenges the old ways of shopping.
Peter Jones is angry after Holly Willaby cancels 11 million Starling deal
Dragons Den, Peter Jones, expressed anger after the TV star Holly Willavi cancelled an 11 million-starling deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marx & Spencer and ITV.
Actually, Willaby doesn't have time for their home clothes and accessories.
The joint business of the two is similar to the Goop brand of actress Guinth Paltro.
The 37-year-old program presents this Morning announced her departure from the post in Astgram.
Holly Willavi left the star Dragons Den Peter Jones angry that at the last moment she cancelled her participation in the two luxury lifestyle brand - to focus on her fat contracts with Marx & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones responded \"in anger\" when the television star announced during a shocking Tuesday meeting in his main offices in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, due to her new deals -- worth up to 1.5 Sterling -- she didn't have enough time to be devoted to branding their home clothes and accessories Truly.
The joint business was considered similar to the Goop brand of actress Guinth Paltro and was expected to double Willavi's fortune, which was estimated to be 11 million starlings.
While the 37-year-old Willaby published in Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones was on a flight from Britain to one of his resorts.
According to one source, “Truly was undoubtedly the top priority of Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would provide her with income in the coming decades.
A decision to leave surprise all those involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
The company's warehouses in Marlow are full of products ready for sale.
Experts believe this Morning's departure, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, could cost the company millions as a result of massive investments in diverse products, from mines and candles to household clothes, and the potential for further delay in launch.
And that could bring you to the end of a long friendship.
Willavi, who was a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had close friends with Jones and his wife Tra Cup for ten years.
Willaby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the company in March.
The couple spent vacations together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willavi will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McFerlin as an I'm A Celebrity program for ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: \"We're not responding to his business.\"
A difficult conversation, and then we fell in love.
He joked about her criticism of the news media about statements that some define as \"non-presidential\" and that he's so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said in the voice of \"News Presenter\"
I didn't make any concessions.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after praising their first meeting in June as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on the dissolution of a frozen nuclear weapon.
More than three months after the June summit meeting in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ry Young Ho, said on Saturday to world leaders at the UN General Meeting that North Korea does not see a “responsible response” from the U.S. on the side of the initial disarmament measures taken by North Korea.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues sanctions designed to continue the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view of his speech at the stop.
“We’re in great shape with North Korea,” he said.
We almost went to war against North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have great relationships.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim resulted in positive results - stopping missile experiments, helping to release prisoners and returning the remains of U.S. soldiers home.
And he defended his extraordinary approach to talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full-scale stadium, we had about 200 people standing there,” Trump said.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia caused the destruction of an island and the killing of hundreds of people.
After the Bloombow earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that there was no need for their help.
Although more than 10% of the population lost their homes, a national disaster, which is a condition for international aid, has not been declared.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not seeking international assistance, so that’s a bit of a challenge,” said Mrs. Sombong.
Although Save the Children prepares a team that has gone to Palo, it is not yet clear if foreign missionaries can move into the field.
Mr. Sotopo, a spokesman for the Agency for National Disasters, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palo to check if more international services contribute to the aid effort.
In light of the unprecedented earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unfortunately not ready enough for natural disasters.
While tsunami shelters were built in the Ache district, they are rare in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the lack of clarity in alarms is a warning on the Palo tsunami, although there is a warning, has contributed to loss of soul.
Even in the best times, travel between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship that has protected Bloombow to deal with an earthquake is making its way to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
Improving Indonesia's bad infrastructure was at the center of President Joco and his isolation campaign, and he invested many funds on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko is in the presence of funding for his re-election next year.
Mr. Joko was also under pressure from the continued classroom tensions in Indonesia as a result of the religious radicalization of the Muslim majority in the country.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes in battles between Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets - using knives, bows and arrows and other domestic weapons.
Daniel Stardage from Liverpool group is compared at the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from the loss of Chelsea in Premier League with a gate in the 89th minute of Saturday at Stampford Bridge in London.
Stridge received a handover from Dhandan Shakiri when he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's gate and his team at 1-0.
He jumped the ball to his left and then turned a kick toward the distant core.
The ball flew higher over wide and landed towards the top right corner of the network.
Eventually the ball landed above the gate of Kapa Arisbalga, which jumped into it, and fell into the network.
“I just tried to reach this position, reach the ball and players like Shac always play forward as far as possible, so I just tried to create myself as long as possible,” Sredge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Canta and I made one touch and I didn't think about it too much and I was just kicking.
Chelsea led 0-1 in half after Belgian star Aden Zaar conquered a gate in the 25th minute.
The \"Blue\" pioneer moved back to Matthew Kovacich in the same game, before walking around the middle of the field and running quickly into the half of Liverpool's field.
Kobachich performed a fast \"tun and go\" maneuver in the middle of the field.
And then he kicked a beautiful cross kick, which led the laser into the wider.
The front laser ran the defense and ended with the ball in the top right corner of the gate, with a left kick that passed Liverpool player Alyson Baker.
Liverpool will face Naples at the Champions League's home stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at the San Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face a video in the European League of Opa on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of people killed in tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths at the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, according to the state's disaster agency on Sunday morning.
Many people who are trapped in the destruction of buildings that have collapsed with the 7.5-strong earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 metres high, agency spokesman Sotofo Forovo Nerho said at a press conference.
The city of Palo, in which more than 380,000 people were living, was covered with ruins from buildings that had collapsed.
Police arrested 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
Police began investigating a murder after a woman's body was found in Bishkend, Mercedes.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 a.m. on John's street when she was stabbed to the body, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police call on people from the area they saw or heard something to contact.
Detective Brian O'agan said: \"The investigation is at first, but I want to make up for anyone who was next to John Birckenhead Street and have seen or heard something suspicious, contact us.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken a picture of something in a car camera, to contact us - because the photos may include information essential to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman in her body was living in Birkanad and that she was inside a building.
On the scene this afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigations are ongoing as police have announced that they are now in the process of sending messages to relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Jason Moses just tried to get into his apartment, but he was told that the police banned anyone from entering or leaving the building.
He was shocked when he found out what happened.
Residents are now told to go through more hours until they get back to their apartments.
A cop sounds telling one person that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman looked at the scene when she was heard.
She's coming back and saying, \"It's terrible.\"
At 14:00, two police trucks were seen inside the scene and one more outside.
A number of police officers were standing inside the scene targeting people in the apartment building.
Anyone with information is required to send a direct message on Twitter to @MerPolCC, to dial 101 or to contact Crimestoppers on the phone at 0800 555 111 and indicate the log number 247 from September 30.
Cromwell's parliamentary statue has become the next target of attacks on memory situations in the struggle around the \"written history\"
The removal of the statue will be a poetic justice in light of the \"Taliban\" disposal by its pro-Puritans so many cultural and religious art objects in England
But the Cromwell Society claims that Mr. Crick's proposal is \"supplicating\" and trying to write history.
John Goldsmouth, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current dispute over the removal of sculptures, the character of Oliver Cromwell who was located outside the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The sculptures of civil wars in England were not carried out by Cromwell and were not carried out by him.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell fell victim to the actions of one of his predecessors in the dynasty, Thomas Cromwell, in the century before.
Cromwell's impressive representation in the hands of Sir William Hamo Turnicroft, is a testimony to the 19th century's view and part of the history of a character who many believe is still worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmouth told the Sunday newspaper: \"Cromwell was captured by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as he defended parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the royal.
The question of whether this is an entirely accurate assessment is a property of ongoing historical controversy.
An unimportant fact is that the struggle in the middle of the 17th century designed the development of our nation later, and Cromwell is one identified figure representing one side of the Holocaust at that time.
His achievements as \"the protective Lord\" are also worthy of respect and victory.
A deadly pig who travels Chinese farmer to die
Local media sources report that a pig is attacked by agricultural deaths in the Southwest China market.
The man, identified as his family, was found dead with a broken artery as he was covered in blood near the pig's apartment in the Blokenshui market in Guijuo County, according to the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A farmer prepares to inject vaccinations for pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Singh Province, China.
He went Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yonan to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and found out that a door to a pig's apartment was open.
He said Badir was found a big male pig with blood on his mouth.
A criminal investigation confirmed that the 250 kg pig killed the farmer, according to the report.
My uncle's legs were full of blood and heavy, the cousin told him that his name was \"Wow\" as quoted in Guiyang Events News.
In security cameras, Yuan appeared to have entered the market on Thursday morning at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the man did not belong to Ivan or his cousin.
A market manager told Event News that the pig was locked behind a sawmill to prevent him from attacking other people, while police collected evidence at the scene.
It was reported that negotiations between the Yuan family and the market authorities were taking place on compensation for his death.
Although the phenomenon is rare, cases where pigs have been attacked have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and their husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused the owner of human injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kg pig was a farmer in Wales to his tractor until the farmer's wife smuggled the animal.
After an organic farmer was joined by his pigs in 2012, one farmer told CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood may be a Trigger.
They're just playing.
They're like naughty, very curious kids... they're not going to hurt you.
You just need to give them the right respect - he said.
The remains of the Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rains in large areas in the south-west of the United States.
According to the forecast, the hurricane of the Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves above the colder waters on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
However, the storm will bring winds of winds all over the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States over the coming days.
The winds at the Rosa storm reached 135 km/h, i.e. the hurricane of the hurricane at level 1, and from Sunday at 5:00 a.m., according to the eastern coast clock, the storm centre is 620 km east of Punta Eugene, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it begins to form an epoch over the Pacific that is east towards the east coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula in the California Amha on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will start pushing deep tropical moisture north-south into the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, tropical humidity that will integrate with the approaching effect will produce heavy rain in large parts of the Southwest of the United States during the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause floods in the desert and endanger land.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rain to reach 50 to 75 mm per hour at different points, especially in parts of south Nevada and Arizona.
Rains in quantities of 50 to 100 mm are expected in parts of the Southwest of the United States, especially in Arizona.
Floods may occur with conditions rapidly deteriorating due to the tropical rain.
It is highly recommended to avoid walking long distances in the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn malls into hurricanes and hurricanes will bring strong dusty winds and duststorms.
The approaching peak will bring local rain to parts of the southern California coast.
Total amounts of rain may be more than 13 mm, which may cause waste to be carried out and roads are smooth.
This will be the first rain in this rainy season.
Metropolitan rainwaters will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning, and rain will be strengthened and spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and will last on Wednesday.
In October there may be sharp temperature changes across the United States, while the Arctic region is cooling but the tropical region remains quite warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature between short distances.
On Sunday, there is an excellent example of extreme temperature changes across the center of the United States.
There's a temperature difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Ummaha, Nebraska and St. Louis de La Moyen, Iowa.
In the coming days, long summer heat will try to evolve and expand again.
At the beginning of October, temperatures would be warm in most central and eastern regions of the U.S., moving from 27 to 31 degrees from the southern to the north-east.
In New York City temperature may reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term weather forecast shows higher temperatures than the average in the East in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing by Bert Quano.
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday, on six television networks, the exciting testimony of the candidate for the Supreme Court, Burt Kwano, and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blazi Ford.
Meanwhile, the political conflict continued, with news flashing in the middle of the regular broadcasts to announce a surprising development on Friday: an agreement drafted by Senator Marizona Jeff Flick according to which the FBI will conduct a weekly investigation into the charges.
Ford told the St.'s Legal Committee that she was 100% confident that Quano would exhaust her body as he was drunk and tried to take her off during a high school student party.
Quano, a mixed testimony, said he was 100% sure that it didn't happen.
The number of viewers is likely to be even higher than the report of 20.4 million viewers according to the Nielsen Index.
Nielsen has examined the average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC networks.
The data were not available immediately for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually makes it difficult to measure people watching the offices.
In comparison, the audience is watching on a similar scale as football or Oscar.
According to Nielsen's data, Fox News Channel, whose commentators support Kavano's appointment, led all of the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day hearing.
ABC was second in place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The level of interest remained high after the hearing.
Senator Flick was the main character in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican Senator issued a message that he would vote for the appointment of Kavano, he was photographed by CNN and CBS photographers when a group of protesters screamed at him while trying to enter the elevator to get to a hearing at the legal committee.
He was at a humiliating look for a few minutes while the protests hit him, when all of this was broadcast live on CNN.
I'm standing here before you, one of the women said.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
He was told, \"You have power while so many women are helpless.\"
Flick said his office had published a message and said, before the elevator door was closed, he would say more at the committee's hearing.
All broadcasts and cable networks were broadcast live hours later, when the legal committee was about to point out that Quano's nomination for the Senate vote was submitted.
But Flick said he would vote for the nomination only on the condition that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate over the next week, which required the members of the Democratic minority.
Flick was partly persuaded by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Cons.
After a conversation with Cons and several Senators, Flick made his decision.
Flick's decision had power, because it was clear that Republicans would not be most likely to confirm the appointment of Kavano without investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate charges against Quano.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of “playing in politics” on Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May blamed her EU departure plans for “playing in politics” with Britain’s future and harming the national internet, in an interview given to the Sunday Times.
Prime Minister Teresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview that appeared next to the idea on the main page of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her \"Dumpy Game\" program to Brexit, saying that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the European Union would back up this \"completely corrupt\" of this one.
Wed Sims shooting: Police arrested Diton Simpson as suspect of LSU murder
Police arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting at Lloyd Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played in the LSU group.
A 20-year-old man named Diton Simpson was arrested and charged with first-degree murder, known by the Baton Rog police.
Officials published a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the conflict.
Police found glasses at the scene and said Simpson's DNA was found on them, according to a WAFB report, which is part of CBS.
After the Simpson investigation, the police said he had admitted that he had shot Lloyd to death.
Guarantee fees were set at $350,000, as reported in Advocate.
The pathological Institute of the East Baton Rose Department published a first report on Friday, according to which the cause of death is a shot wound in the head and inside the neck.
The police gave credit to the task force to capture fugitive criminals at the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and civilians in the area that helped investigate the suspect.
LSU University’s Director of Athletics, Joe Alva, thanked the law enforcement authorities in the region for “presiding and pursuit of justice”
Sims was 20.
The Ford Basketball, which has a height of more than 2 meters, grew up in Baton Rose, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
Its average previous season is 5.6 points and 2.6 rebound pills.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Weid said that the group was “damaging” and “damaging” the death of Lloyd.
“That’s what you’re worried about all the time,” said Lloyd.
Mount Bolt Ash on Mexico City
A dust that came out of the peak of Popoceptel reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the residents of Mexico on Saturday to stay away from the hurricane after the mountain-breathing activity was increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were registered within 24 hours.
In the center there are several noises and conferences.
Photos on social networks have shown minute layers of ashes cover on the uses of cars in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Sochimiko.
Geophysicalists have noticed increased activity in the volcano located 72 km (45 miles) south-east of the capital, since a 7.1-strong earthquake took over the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Gou, has been active since 1994.
Clash between the police and Catalans near the year for a vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent protesters clashed with police forces to spread demonstrations, and thousands joined demonstrations against the first anniversary of the party's vote on Catalonia's independence.
A group of masked buckets that were blocked by police to spread demonstrations, threw eggs and spread color powder to create black dust clouds on the streets that were usually shocked by tourists.
Conflicts also broke out later that day when police officers were forced to use gods to overcome the protesters.
For a couple of hours, independent support groups who called “unforgetted, not forgiven” in front of the unityists called the “Jewish of Spain”
In the local press, it was reported that 14 people were treated with mild injuries suffered by the protesters.
Tensions remained high in the independent areas one year after the October 1 referendum was held in a legal prison by the Spanish government, but was celebrated by independent Catalanists.
Voters chose a large majority of votes to become an independent state, even though the vote was low when those who opposed the separation largely blocked the vote.
Catalonia's government authorities reported that nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent polling across the region in violent conflicts.
Independent support groups set up night-to-night camps on Friday to prevent a national police demonstration.
The demonstration took place but had to be conducted on a different track.
Narciss Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the protest with his wife, said he had lost hope of Catalonia's chance of independence.
Last year we experienced our best moments.
I saw my parents crying happy that they could vote, but now we're stuck -- he said.
Although the Catalan differences have won an important victory, although far, in the December election, they have made it difficult to maintain momentum this year, with many of their most known leaders staying in exile or in prisons awaiting trial for some of them in the People's Assembly, following the declaration of independence.
Juan Fuig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police support demonstration on his phone, said the conflict was mixed by politicians on both sides of the conflict.
“It’s getting worse,” he said.
On Saturday, Uriol Unkers, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison waiting for trial since late last year, announced that he would run the European Parliament election next year.
\"To stand as a candidate for European elections is the best way to define the practice of democratic values and the oppression that we have witnessed from the government of Spain,\" he said.
Several men were arrested after the car crashed at home
Three men - aged 33.34 and 39 - were arrested after the car crashed several times at the Blondondry house.
The event took place in Linagagra kersant on Thursday around 19:30 p.m.
Detective Bob Blemings said that there was damage to the gates as well as to the building itself.
At some point a key arrow may also be fired into the car.
Manga's kick gives Livingstone a 1-0 win over Ranggers
Dolly Manga's First Gate to Livingstone promised victory
Livingston, who was only a member of the league, struck Ranggers and believed that it was only his second loss in 18 games as director of the iBrox club.
Dolly Manga's kicking was very significant because Gary Holt's team moved to a level with Hibernian in the second place.
Jarar's team remains unwinning outside of the season's Premier League, and will face top Harts, who is behind her at eight points, on Sunday.
Prior to that, Ranggers will host Rafid and Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended the loss sequence to six games, and chief coach Holt has not yet experienced a break since he replaced Kelly Miller last month.
Livingstone has missed opportunities in front of a weak host group
Holt's team was supposed to lead a long way before they had a gate, when their directness caused Ranggers to have different problems.
Scott Robinson broke forward but drew his attempts before the gate, and then Alan Lithway could only focus his efforts to the broad after he slided in to meet Craig Helgat's sight before the gate.
Guests were ready to let Ringer play before them, knowing that they could make it difficult for the host group to kick free.
And that was the way the decisive gate was opened.
Hergers took a free kick and Livingston created an opening, Deklan Gallagher and Robinson joined to block Manga, who made a touch and conquered a gate from the center of the expansion.
At this point, Rangers had control over holding the ball but found that house defense was inconceivable, and the gatekeeper Liam Kelly was almost unsatisfied.
This pattern attracted to the second half, although Alfredo Morelos did forced Kelly to save the gate.
Scott Pittnaem was arrested by Ranggers Alan McGregor and Lith Goe touched the ball from another free kick of Ligston.
Cross-balls continued to enter and fade into Livingston's wide range, while two penalty balls - after the attack on the replacement Glen Middleton, and one on hand - were removed.
\"Friendly\" Melvinston - Analysis
Elstyre Lamont, BBC Scotland at Tony McCrone Stadium
An amazing game and an amazing result from Melvinston.
All the players were great, and they continued to be ahead of expectations of this trend.
Their game style and the players have almost not changed since they returned to the leading position, but have to give a lot of credit for the way he's dried up the team since his arrival.
He had so many stars.
Captain Holtt was great, leading a remarkablely organized defense, while Manga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Waral in high quality all along the way.
But Ringers were inspirationless.
Although they were sometimes pretty good under Jarar, they didn't meet these standards.
They were missing the final ball - only once they opened the home team's defense - and it's a red light for Ranggers, who found themselves in the middle of the field.
Conspiracy to Erdogan
There were blue smiles and sky when Turkish and German leaders met on Saturday (September 29) for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, whose goal was to correct the relationship between the two member states of NATO.
They were divided over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's acceptance of the European Union.
Erdogan continued to participate in the opening of a new huge mosque.
Clen is the city of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police have announced security reasons for blocking the public of 25,000 people from gathering at the front of the mosque, but many supporters have joined up nearby to see the president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opposition protesters, many of whom are Kurds, also heard their voices, protesting both Erdogan's policy lines and Germany's decision to welcome it to the country.
The counter-protesters reflect the debate around the guest that some of the Turks in Germany praise him as a hero and others defend him as a fan.
Car crash: Motorcycle driver killed in crash with car
A bike rider was killed in a crash with a London car.
The collision took place near the street corner of Stwood and Avalin, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The car driver stopped and veggies treated the injured, but the man died instead.
The collision came after another bike rider was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childer Street, about a mile from the scene on Saturday.
The city police said police were trying to identify the killing and inform the relatives of his family.
Instead of wearing barriers and buses, it is recommended that drivers avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prisoners were wounded in a riot
Six prisoners were wounded in a riot in a men's safe prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Westershire on Sunday around 09:30 according to the UK clock, and it continues.
Special officers from the Tornado unit were brought to the place to eliminate the riot, which included eight prisoners and was beaten into one wing.
Guards were treated instead because of minor injuries inside.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially skilled guards were recruited to deal with an ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six guards were treated due to injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those involved will be delivered to the police and their prison terms may be extended.
The Long Lartin Prison houses 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison governor was reported to have received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, police spread demonstrations were called to the prison to deal with a serious riot in which guards were attacked with snoker sticks.
The Hurricane Rosa is threatening flash floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It's rare that tropical hits in Arizona, but that's exactly what's expected to happen early next week, when the remainder of the hurricane Rosa will cross the desert in the southeastern and bring them danger to the flood.
The National Weather Service has already declared a flood danger on Mondays and Tuesdays for western Arizona into Southeast Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flags, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The storm is expected to go directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and get close to the end of Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix posted on Twitter that only 10 tropical cyclone storms remained in the status of a tropical storm or tropical storm in the range of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950!
The Catharina Storm (1967) was the hurricane of hurricanes in the range of 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of Arizona's hurricanes center watch 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm in the sides of Arizona's Mogolon.
Other areas in the Southwest Desert, including the Central Rock Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to receive 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility for isolated locations to receive a total of 50 mm.
For those outside the flood zone, the rain of the Rosa storm may be a blessing because the region suffered from drought.
Although floods are a serious danger, some of these rains will be helpful because the south-west region currently suffers from a condition in the form.
According to U.S. makeup tracking, over 40 percent of Arizona is in a difficult shape, which is the second category in its hardware, according to the website reader.com.
First of all, the course of the Rosa storm will arrive on the land across the Peninsula in the California Amhara in Mexico.
The Roza storm, which is still in the power of hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugene, Mexico, moving north of 20 km/h.
The storm runs into colder water in the Pacific, so it's getting weaker.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm in the afternoon or Monday evening.
Rains across parts of Mexico can be heavy and cause severe floods.
\"The total amount of rain is 75 to 150 mm expected from the California Expedition to the north-west of Sonora, with a chance of up to 250 mm, reporting water.com.
Then the Rosa storm will continue into Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning of Tuesday as a tropical storm, which will then continue across Arizona into South Utah on Tuesday night.
The main danger that is expected from Rosa, or from her remnant, is heavy rain in Baja California, southwestern Sonora, and the Southwest Desert in the United States, a message from the National Center for Hurricane.
These rains are expected to cause flood floods and the flow of dangerous falls in the desert, and earthquakes in the mountainous areas.
Marsmar Norton Attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with crack wounds in Sommerst.
The boy was injured in the Midsmer Norton region on Sunday at around 04:00 according to the UK clock.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remained in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys, and a 20-year-old man was arrested during the night in Radstock, Avon, and Somerst.
The police are asking anyone who may have a mobile phone of what has happened to contact the police.
Trump said that Kwano \"suffered the injustice and anger\" of the Democratic Party
\"The vote for Judge Kavano is a vote to reject the cruel and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party,\" Trump said at a stop in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said that he had suffered “the injustice, anger” of the Democratic Party throughout his entire appointment process.
Kavano testified to Congress on Thursday, while he openly denied Christine Blazi Ford's guilt that he had sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified in a hearing about her guilt.
The president said on Saturday that \"the residents of the United States have seen the brilliantness, quality and courage\" of Kavano that day.
The vote to confirm the appointment of Judge Kavano is a vote to confirm the appointment of one of the most excellent legal minds of our time, a courtman with a great past of public service, he told his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavano as he spoke of the importance of Republicans coming to vote in the mid-term election.
Five more weeks to one of the most important votes in our lives.
I am not a candidate, but actually I am a candidate, he said.
\"So I run everywhere to fight for great candidates.\"
Trump said Democrats were sent to “oppose and interfere”
A senior assistant at the Republican Party told CNN that the first pro-doctorial vote in full Senate on the appointment of Quano is expected to take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number increases.
At least 384 people have been killed, many of whom have been swept away in huge waves crashing on the beaches, with a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Salavoussi, according to official sources on Saturday.
Many people gathered at the beach festival in Palo on Friday, when waves carried at a height of 6 feet (18 feet) crashed on the beach during the sunset, driving many to their death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was due to an earthquake of 7.5.
When the tsunami threat woke up yesterday, people still dealt with their affairs on the coast and did not immediately escape, and they fell victim, Sotopo Forvo Norroho, a spokesman for the BNPB disaster management agency, said in a Jakata alert.
“The tsunami didn’t come by itself, he dragged cars, wooden bowls, houses, he hit everything on the ground,” he said, adding that the tsunami had advanced across the open sea at a speed of 800 km (497 miles an hour) before hitting the coast line.
Some of the people walked on trees to escape the tsunami and they survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people turned to 24 centers in Palo.
Air photographs published by the Disaster Agency have shown destruction to a large number of homes and shops, curved bridges and courses and a mosque surrounded by water.
A minor shock continued to poison the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes has occurred in the area of 2.4 million people.
The agency for the assessment and implementation of technology (BPPT) in Indonesia noted in a statement that the energy released in the crackdown on Friday was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb imposed on Jerusalem in World War II.
According to him, the geography of the city, which sits at the edge of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Norruho described the destruction as “an enormous” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were trapped under the ruins of buildings that collapsed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Noroho said the number of deaths and damage could be larger along North Palo with a 300-mile (180-mile) beach line, a region called Dongle, which is closer to the area of the earthquake.
“The media has completely destroyed and there is no information” from Mongolia, Norruho said.
More than 300,000 people are living in the area, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its people and volunteers are on their way to affected areas.
“It is now a tragedy, but the situation may get worse,” he said.
On Saturday, she was criticized by the agency for not announcing that a tsunami had hit Palo, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video posted on social networks, a person on a high roof of a building is able to scream hysteria warnings about the tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes a wall of water crashes on the beach, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters failed immediately to make sure that the photo was authentic.
The panic and tsunami caused extensive power cuts that cut the media around Palo and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate the rescue efforts.
The army began sending transport aircraft with assistance from Jacarta and other caves, according to the authorities, but survivors still desperately need food and other essential necessities.
The city's airport is only open for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko and his isolation were planned to visit the rescue centers in Palo on Sunday.
The victims of the tsunami in Indonesia jumped to more than 800.
It's very difficult.
As the world vision from Mongolia arrived in peace to Palo, where sheltered workers made up of Brexit built in the courtyards of their offices, they passed through sights of destruction on their way, Mr. Dosba said.
“They told me they saw many homes destroyed,” he said.
It's very difficult.
Even at a time when aid groups began with the unfortunate actions of preventing disaster aid movements, there was a complaint that you had avoided reaching the fall of highly experienced foreign aid workers.
According to the regulations of Indonesia, funding, supplies and people from other countries can only be started if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
This thing hasn't been done yet.
“It is still defined as a district-level disaster,” said Olia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says ‘All right, this is a national disaster’ we can open the door to international aid, but this status has not yet been declared.
With the second night off on Palo after the earthquake on Friday, friends and family members of the missing were hoping that their lies would be the miracles that illuminate the dark stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy went out of the door.
On Sunday, the rescuers rescued a woman buried under ruins for two days, with her body being threatened by her side.
Gandon Sovandono, the coach of Indonesia's Flooring Team, trained two missing placards for Asian games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those trapped in the hotel see, among them Mr. Mendgie, were his students.
“I am carrying my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gandon recalls how in the hours after the news of a hotel crash sees a widespread community in the plalo, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to rivals in Palo, who took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages showed only one gray review sign, instead of a pair of blue marks.
“I think it means that the messages are not delivered,” he said.
The thieves took $26,750 while filling up a ATM in Newport on the Leve
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 from a cryptocurrency processor at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport on the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car Rocken as a ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to bring more money, researcher Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man ran behind a Brinks employee and stole a bag with money to fill in the ATM.
Until he saw a number of suspects fleeing the scene, he said, but the police did not tell how many people were involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identity is requested to contact the Newport Police on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kenya West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Harper Kenya West changes his name to Ye.
In a statement on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: \"The entity that was known as Kenya West\"
The 41-year-old West has been known as \"Ye\" for a while and he used the term \"his eighth album,\" which was released in June.
The change comes first on Stardy Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande who has cancelled her participation for “emotional reasons” as the creator of the program said.
In addition, it's a summary of his current professional name, West once said that a word has religious meaning for him.
I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible the word means ‘you’ West said earlier this year, when he spoke about his album with the radio broadcaster Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It passed from Kanye, whose only and only meaning is to just “Ye” - just reflections of the good of his son, the bad son, or the confused, everything.
The album is more reflections of who we are.
He's one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Kombes was known for his alternative name Puff Duddy, Pip Duddy or Dedy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names \"love\" and \"brother love\".
A former partner of West, J.Z., also passed between versions of his name with and without a license and letters.
Mexico’s president has vowed not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andres Manuel Lupes Obrdor, has committed never to use military force against civilians, as the state is approaching 50th anniversary for bloodless repression against students.
Lupes Oberdor promised on Saturday in Taltoloko Square \"Never use the army to suppress the Mexican people.\"
Army forces shot at a non-violent demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
Lupes Obrador has committed to support young Mexicans by providing financial support to those who learn and open more public universities for free.
He said that unemployment and lack of education opportunities push young people into crime gangs.
The U.S. needs to double the funding of artificial intelligence.
With China’s growing activity in artificial intelligence, the U.S. needs to double the amount it invests in research in the field, says an artificial intelligence researcher Kai-Pu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His words come after various parts of the U.S. government have issued statements about artificial intelligence, even as the U.S. government has no formal artificial intelligence strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be number one in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Doping the research budget in the field of artificial intelligence will be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence,” he said.
Double funding can double the chances that the next big artificial intelligence will be achieved in the U.S., telling me to CNBC in the interview this week.
Lee, whose book, AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, was published in the month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Innovation Ventures, who invested in China's most prominent artificial intelligence company Face++.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Hotel, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the first-class Rabrissi player in the United States, and later served as a senior director at Microsoft Research and the president of Google's branch in China.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the agency's robotics challenge for advanced research projects, and asked when to come next, to help identify the next vision.
U.S. researchers often need to work hard to win government grants, he told me.
\"It's not China that takes us the leading researchers at the Academy, it's the business companies that do it,\" he told me.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have raised stars from universities in recent years to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
I think we should automatically offer Green Card to a doctorate in artificial intelligence, he said.
In July 2017, the China State Council published its artificial intelligence development plan for the next generation.
The Chinese National Fund for Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are the U.S. Department of Pensions for Researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center, which is intended for the evening of partners from industry and academia, and the White House has announced the establishment of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
As for NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, a U.S. legislation initiative designed to create a National Security Committee for Artificial Intelligence has not been active for months.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum with the question of whether to change the name of the country.
On Sunday, Macdonia's residents vote on a referendum with the question of whether to change its name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, a step to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that prevented it from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in which there is a province called Macdonia, claims that its neighbour's name from the north is in the line of a claim to the territory of Greece and the territory of the Union to join NATO and the European Union.
Both countries signed a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalists argue that the change would hurt the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote on the people's referendum and a campaign of boycotting raised doubts as to whether the number of voters would stand at a minimum of 50 per cent required for the people's question to be valid.
The question in the voting note is this: \"Are you in favour of joining NATO and the European Union upon acceptance of the agreement with Greece?\"
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeyev, claim that this is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries created by the dissolution of Yugoslavia, can join bodies like the European Union and NATO.
I came today to point to the future of the country, for young people in Madonna so that they can live freely under the EU umbrella, because it means a safe life for all of us, according to the 79th-year-old Olivera Georgesbca in Skopje.
Although the question of the people is not a legal requirement, enough members of parliament said they had complied with the results of the vote to make it permanent.
To change the name will require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election committee said there was no irregularity at 13:00.
However, only 16 percent of voters stood, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, with 66 percent of the voting rights being voted.
I came to vote because of my kids, our place is in Europe, saying 62-year-old Jossa Tanevsky, voting in the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zuran Zeyev, his wife Zoroka and his son Duchyu complete their voting note in Stromica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, at the People's Assembly in Madonna on the change of the name of the state, opening the door to joining NATO and the European Union.
On the front of the Parliament in Skopje, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kwarderkov made small-scale chairs and chairs in front of tents that set up those who boycott the people's referendum.
“We’re in favour of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join the head of an offensive, not through the entry of the servants,” Kawardrkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have respect.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian Union.
Prime Minister Zeyev said companies in NATO would bring the most needed investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate was over 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will be in favour of more than 80% of our citizens supporting the European Union and NATO,” Zeyev said after voting.
He said a positive result would be our future security.
A survey published on Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the People's referendum - less than the required percentage of participation.
Another referendum, held by Telma TV, found that 57 of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote “yes”.
In order for the people to succeed, the percentage of voters should be at least 50% and one more.
Failure of the referendum will be the first significant loss of pro-West government policy since it seized power in May last year.
Video: Manchester City Actor, Xiao Aguero, navigates through the entire Bryton Defense to score a gate
Aguero's and Sterling's Raids broke up Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Illihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It looks like Aguero's holding the gate easy.
The Argentine pioneer received a handover in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defense players before he broke into the open field.
At this point Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one shield before he got a few more shields on Brighton's extensive border.
And then he kicked off from the left, and found Sterling.
The English pioneer used his first touch widely to hand the ball back to Aguero, who kicked right foot defeated Brighton's poet, Matthew Ryan, with a bullet on the right side of the network.
Aguru has leg problems,” Manchester City’s director told reporters.
“We agreed he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he took a gate at that moment.
But it was Sterling that gave the \"Starlings\" the first advantage in the Super League's rivals.
This gate came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's territory during this time.
He sent a great crossball along the right wing to Leroy Sana.
Sana drew the ball before he led Sterling towards the distant core.
A blue sky player pushed the ball into the grid right before he walked out of the field.
Manchester City will face fashions in the Champions League home game Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rain-Nakar Stadium in Zeinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play Spoiler against the Rockis
With the exit of the Nationals from the playoff competition, there was no good reason to force another start.
But Schrezer, who features a lot of competition, hopes to win on Sunday against Colorado Rockis, but only if it still has implications for the playoff for Rockis, who lead one game on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West League.
The Rockis showed themselves at least a place of an open ticket with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but did not promise the first place at home.
Although we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play in knowing that the air here is in Denver with the viewers and the second team will play at the highest level probably at any point I'm dealing with this year.
Why don’t I want to deal with it?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the starter for Sunday, but according to the reports they tend to allow the hacker to submit in such a situation.
Sherrezer, which will be his 34th start, performed a Bologne training on Thursday and will be served on his rest day - Sunday.
Washington's right-hand player has a record of 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 falls in 220 rounds 2/3 season.
Trump has a stop in West Virginia
The president, in contrast, pointed to the situation around his elected candidate to the Supreme Court, Bart Kwano, as he spoke of the importance that Republicans would vote in the mid-term election.
Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five more weeks for the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the most, the most -- I don't deal, but actually I'm dealing with, so I run everywhere and fight for great candidates -- he said.
Trump continued, saying, “You see this terrible and terrible group of extreme Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And if determined to take back the power in any necessary means, you see the evils, the horrors.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to run to gain power and control, that's what they want is power and control, we're not gonna give them that.
Democrats are, according to him, sent by “opposition and interference”
“And you see it during the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “greedy, evil, and unreasonable.”
He named the minority leader of the Senate Legal Committee, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who carried out calls from the public.
Remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I waited until -- it was really a bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a floristic place.
She's not patient with those who express their opinion.
When movement activists at my local party's branch voted to scramble me, it wasn't really a surprise.
After all, I'm the last one in a line of Labour MPs that told them that they were not wanted - and only because we expressed our opinion.
My MP, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the decision to swing me was to visit me because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe, most of the irony, issues similar to those whose backs Jeremy did not agree with previous party leaders.
At the meeting of the East Nottingham Liberal Party on Friday, it was said that \"we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive.\"
For most of my eight years as a local member of the Labour Party, meetings of the General Committee on Fridays were exactly like that.
Today’s move is not the result of many meetings and the promise of “more friendly, more subtle” politics has long been forgotten, if it has ever begun.
It turns out that the Labour Party has no tolerance for different views, and any opinion is judged according to its acceptance of the party's leadership.
This situation began shortly after Jeremy was elected head of the party, when colleagues who had previously thought that we shared a similar political view began to expect him to make a pedagogical turn and take positions that I would never otherwise agree to - whether on national security or on a single European market.
Every time I speak to the public -- and it doesn't really matter what I'm saying -- it's coming immediately from an abusive wave of social media uncertainty with calls for rejection, a political denouncing of the center and calls that I don't have to be in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I'm more fortunate than I am, because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I'm once from the professionality and determination of those colleagues who stand each day against a wave of racist abuse but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become a routine matter.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're already the same place as floristic, and with every decision of \"unbelieven\" or change in the generals of choice, the party becomes more difficult.
Over the last two years, many will advise me to shut my mouth, not be so vocal and then I'll be okay.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, I have been shocked by the neglect of the Thatcher government that caused my public school class almost to collapse, I've been looking for ways to fight better social services for those who need it most -- whether as a member of a local council or a government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, including in the last election.
No man in East Nottingham could in any way be confused as to my political positions and issues of my dispute with the current leadership.
For those who made the decision on Friday, all I have to say is that while the country is crawling towards Brexit that will hurt our families, business and public service, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Leader.
But in fact the one message I have is not to the Momentum Movement in Nottingham, but to my elected public, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of rejection threats or political benefits will prevent me from acting in the way that I believe that you most serve the interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Unsatisfied Air to the Summit
The last two fresh ones gave little attention to the final result, but no doubt Air deserves a victory in today’s wonderful game of the Scottish Super League.
They are now at the top of the table, the undisputed only side of the age.
In the end, it was their best defense, as well as taking the risks much more, that they played for the home team, and coach Peter Morcchi had all the reasons to be satisfied.
“We’ve been on the test for our games so far, and we’re still unobsessed, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie from the Melrose group said, \"Air comes all the credit, they've taken better risks than us.\"
Grant Anderson's Trey in the 14th minute, played by Fraser Klimo, placed Air in the leading position, but a yellow card for Scotland team player Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Waryors, allowed Melrose to get points and Jason Bagot caught a Trey who wasn't allowed to play.
Calimo raised Air's transport with an offence, before actually half, he conquered and then converted Trey Solo to get 17-5 Air in half.
But Melrose opened the second half well and freshly by Patrick Angerson, who was played by Boutt, cut the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury of Rodrich Knut, taken away from there in Alonka, and from the game's renewal, Air increased the gap through Stafford McDowell's Trey, played by Klimo.
The captain of Air Blair McFerson then seized a yellow card, and once again Melrose took advantage of the other person with Truy who wasn't a bet of Bruce Colwin, at the end of a sequence of extreme pressure.
But the house team recovered, and when Strawn Tachinson received a yellow card for a bullet-free Klimo attack, the punishment line, McFerson conquered Tach Down behind Air's advanced Mall.
Calimo Ther, as he did almost once again from returning to the game, after Kyle Roy S kicking David Armstrong's Box and sending Roger Henry's garage to the sixth Triy of the home team.
Still Game is ready for a new career in restaurants.
Still Game, Ford Kirnan, appears ready to move to the restaurant after it was found to be the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old player plays Jack Jarvis' role in the popular BBC show, which he writes and where he stars together with his old partner for comedy, Greg Hampshire.
The pair announced that the next 9th season would be the final season of the program, and it seems that Kirna is planning life after Kriling.
According to the official records, he is the manager of Adriftmorn Limited.
The player refused to comment on the story, although a source of the Scottish San suggested that Kirnana was looking for ways to get into the thriving restaurant business in Glasgow.
\"The Sea is ours\": Bolivia that doesn't find the sea hopes the court will open a path to the Pacific Ocean
Salts sail at the Navy's headquarters are loaded with few ships in the Bella-Paz.
Public buildings flood a blue sea-colored flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon bear the slogan: \"The sea is our right.
It is our duty to sue him back.
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of a beach line lost in favor of Chile in a bloody conflict on resources in the 19th century is still alive - as well as the chemistry to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes may have been in Shean for decades, while Bolivia is waiting for an International Court ruling on October 1 after five years of discussions.
\"Lolibia has the momentum, one spirit, and peace, and he of course expects from a positive attitude to come,\" said Andrew Calazilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be aware of the decision of the International Court on large agreements across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will decide for the sake of Bolivia's demand that after decades of interrupted talks, Chile will undertake negotiations on granting sovereign access to Bolivia.
Bolivia’s prime-born president, Ooh Morales, who faced a controversial struggle to re-election the next year, ruled a lot on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But commentators believe there's no way that the court will determine for Bolivia's benefit -- and that even if it decides for its own good, it doesn't matter much.
The U.N. court sitting in the Hague has no authority to grant Chile's territory, not to determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court’s decision came only six weeks after hearing the agreed arguments indicates that the case was “uncomplexed” but Pazz Zarata, a Chilean expert for international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's claims, even the last four years may have weakened them.
The issue of access to the sea was kidnapped by the current government in Bolivia, said Zarata.
Morales' war rhetoric has eliminated every remaining of good will from Chile, she says.
Sometimes Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions after that.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Valza, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court ruling was exceptionally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a great opportunity to open a new era in relations with Chile, and to put an end to 139 years of disputes in favour of both sides, he said.
Klazadila also denied Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, using the sea as a political leverage.
“Bololibia will never give up its right to access the Pacific” he added.
Stopping is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past.
North Korea says nuclear damage will not be removed unless it can give the U.S. Empire
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ry Young, said his country would never release its nuclear weapon first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Meeting.
He called on the U.S. to keep promises made during the summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His words come as U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears to be on the threshold of a reopen of diplomatic contacts on nuclear weapons that have reached a dead end more than three months after a summit in Singapore with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un.
Ri said it was “a dream in Aspamia” to think that the continued sanctions and opposition of the United States to declare the end of the Korean War would force North Korea to be a blessing.
The U.S. is afraid to agree to the declaration without North Korea first taking significant steps to dismantle nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump are interested in a second summit.
However, there is widespread suspicion that North Korea is serious about giving up its nuclear weapons, where it is likely to see the only way to protect its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion show reveals the new trend with huge hats on its way to luxury stores everywhere
We will find the solution for anyone who wants to expand the hat collection or get complete protection from the sun.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown revealed a series of huge and crazy head coverings for their SS19 collection, in a fashion show that covered the style scene of the Paris Fashion Week.
Inexact hats captured the summer Instagram, and these designers brought their extraordinary works to the fashion show track.
Valentino's outstanding item was an excessive-colored hat in slags across wide-angled ranges with the patterns covering the heads of the models.
Other accessories in size included embroidery, magic hats and even rape - but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Tom Brown also revealed a selection of strange masks - check time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks included gray lips and blood more to the neck and neck than to humour a body.
One work mentioned a dive mask including snorkel and glasses, and one other looked like an Ice Cup.
And those who want to continue with an enormously fashionable word - their time has come.
Fashionists expect the giant hills to make their way to luxury stores everywhere.
The giant hats are the next hit after La Bumba, a tough hat with a half-meter diameter that is watched on everyone's head, ranging from Mariana to Emily Ratakakovsky.
The Calt Abel behind the very impracticable hat that sunk social networks had another big creation on the track - a key bag almost as large as the one of the seawear model that carried it.
The hot-colored comfort bag, with a white leather handy tops, was the prominent item in Jacqueline La Riviera's SS19 collection in Paris Fashion Week.
\"I'm watching big hats and large seabags coming to the luxury shops next summer - because the design made a huge impression and would be hard to ignore the demand for super sized accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for people of the world
The independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this lasts in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which receives a strengthening of personal and group success in sport, art, music and other community-based domains.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), seek to give the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, for a career in which they will be chosen and placed as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that is able to plan and implement a personalized curriculum, we discover that modern languages continue to gain popularity as a desired field of study at school.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it goes into his head.
If you speak to someone in your own language, it comes into your heart.
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build ties and trust with people from other countries.
From the last test results this year, you can see that languages are the top of tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total rate of 68% of students who learned foreign languages achieved a high A score.
The data collected from 74 schools that were members of SCIS showed that 72% of students achieved a high degree A in Madrid, as well as 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish.
These data show that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and youth will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, the field of languages as a subject of choice is considered to be the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' programs and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the British Council for Employment and Skills found that among the reasons employers pointed out to Codes to fill free jobs, 17 percent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills become essential to prepare students for future careers.
In view of the rise in language requirements for future work opportunities, these skills are essential in the world of globalization.
No matter what career a person will choose, if he learns a second language, he will have a significant advantage in the future thanks to this ability that lasts for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries is automatically a person in a position of advantage over competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language at a sufficient level to hold a conversation, and French was the only language in which there was a double-digit number of speakers, 15 percent.
That’s why it’s important to invest now in teaching children’s languages.
Knowledge of many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding significant employment.
Within Scotland, every school will be different as to the languages in which they are taught.
Some of the schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered the most thought for Britain at a forward-looking point in the 20th century, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what the child’s area of interest, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in independent schools, with a staff of teachers who specialize in the field.
The independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed in any future.
It cannot be denied today, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so this fact should come to the fore in education.
Indeed, you should be seen in modern languages “International Communications Skills”
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, diversity and excellence for the children of Scotland.
It's an hour warrant.
John Edward is Chairman of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
Bronne is expected to play for the first time in the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The waiting ended for fans waiting to see Baron James play for the first time at the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play a pre-season game against Denver Nguts on Sunday in San Diego.
But it has not been set for a few minutes yet, it will play.
“This will be more than one and less than 48 on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers wrote Mike Trudle on Twitter, which is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six pre-season games of Lakers.
“At this stage of my career I don’t need a pre-season game to prepare,” he said.
Trump's time of arrest in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is opening the spring of tonight's elections in Willing, Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five planned arrests this week, including arrests in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While voting for a Supreme Court judge, Trump seeks to build support for the upcoming mid-term election, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time does Trump’s arrest take place in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's arrest in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 19:00 according to the East Coast Watch on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's arrest in West Virginia online can be viewed directly on YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer to the hearings held this week for Supreme Court candidate Bert Kavano, and became nervous about the allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour, which resulted in the rejection of the vote in St. Petersburg a week while the FBI is investigating the charges.
But the main goal of this arrestal bath is to help Republicans facing challenging elections in November to get some momentum.
Therefore, President Trump’s election headquarters said that the goal of these five arrests next week was to “collaborate volunteers and support as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in St. Petersburg and the House of Representatives” according to Reuters.
“The Congressional control is so critical to his agenda that the president is ready to visit as many countries as possible with the entrance to the crowded election season,” he told Reuters, speaking of Trump’s campaign to remain anonymous.
The evening stop, which is planned to take place at the Wesbanko Stadium in Weiling, can bring back supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw a press coverage from the media in Pittsburgh to assess the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump visits West Virginia, where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for St. Virginia, Patrick Morrisi, who is undernourished in polls.
This is not a good sign for Morrisi that the president should come to try to improve his situation in polls, says Simon Heider, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team shows willingness to fight to keep hope for single games on Sunday
After three unilateral scissors, the fourth games on Sunday afternoon are perhaps exactly what Ryder Cup needs.
The momentum of momentum is an entirely invented sport concept, but players really believe in it, and never more than in competitions like this.
So where do they think we'll find the momentum right now?
They had a six-point advantage, and now it's four, so you can see it a little bit of momentum, said Johnne Speth at the end of a day.
Europe, of course, is four points ahead with another 12 points in the game.
But the Americans, as Speth says, feel that they have some spirit in the sails, and they have a lot to encourage, not the last of them in the form of a ship, and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them gets three points out of four.
Spyt was a deadly Hetty to the Green and is a leader in a personal example.
The alarms of joy were strengthened as his tour continued, when he felt critical to win the game four all-square and Thomas dropped two after two.
His bat won the game 15on won a similar cry, the kind that shows that he still believes that the American group still has hope.
“It’s really only necessary to dig deep and take care of yourself’s game,” said Spit.
That's all that's left for each of these players to do.
18 Goats to leave a seal.
The only players with more than one map and Thomas over the last two days are Francisco Molinary and Tommy Fletwood, the leading unimportant story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but fascinating pair of Europe are four out of four and get everyone's love.
Molywood was the only pair that didn't hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and late nine on Friday morning.
The same round, and the way their energy appears to flow to and from the enthusiastic audience, is based on the fact that they are the players who win on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fletwood or Molinary to sign a potential European victory with the sun sitting on the golf course Le Golf National.
They're both better at the same time in different regions.
But it’s too early to talk about European fame.
Doll and Tyson Webb Simpson finished with Sergeyo Gercia, this morning's four-ball hero, when he robs Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles in the front nine took the Spanish and the robbery to the hole they didn't get closer to.
However, on Sunday no one will help you get out of the hole.
It’s exciting to look closely at the four balls and fours because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and the way a strategy can change as an eye-opening.
Europe has played better as a group so far and led significantly towards the last day, but this fourth-scan has shown that the U.S. team is full of a spirit of battle that some, mostly within the United States, have questioned.
Europe leads 10-6 to the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is at a healthy advantage for the last day of the Ryder Cup after completing the four-ball games on Saturday 10-6 against the United States.
The full-circuited pair of Tommy Fletwood and Verensco Molinary led the change with two victories over the struggling Tigger Woods, and has so far raised the gap in Le Golf National to four points.
The players on the European side of Thomas Bourne, who tried to protect the Cup lost in Heislatin two years ago, ruled against the Americans who missed the four-ball games this morning and brought the series to 3-1.
U.S. players have shown greater resistance to the fourth games, and have won two games, but they have not managed to close the gap.
To continue holding the Cup, Jim Forrick's friends need eight points from 12 single games.
Flytwood is the first European trojan to win four points in a row, while a multi-player, who won the title \"Mollwood\" after an extraordinary weekend, are only the second pair that won four points from their four opening games in Ryder Cup's history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball games, they continued in a wonderful harmony together to defeat the US duplicator Woods and the American Trick Bryson Dachamba with an even more prominent result of 5 and 4.
Woods, who carried himself over two games on Saturday, demonstrated random outbreaks of excellence, but so far he lost 19 out of the 29 games of the four balls and fours, and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who landed during the four-ball games of the morning, returned to join Henrik Stanson in the fourth games to defeat the result 2 and 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coucha - ranked first and third in the world.
However, not all went easily to European players in the pleasant weather and mild wind that sat south-west of Paris.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spitt, and Justin Thomas set the stage for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a far 2 and 1 victory over John Ram in Spain and Ian Fulter in the four-ball games and later returned to defeat Walter and Rory McLeroy 4 and 3 in the fourth games, after losing both of them.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup group returned from a negative four-point gap to the singles, though as the holding of the Cup, Foric's people only need the bag to continue holding the Cup.
However, after being placed in second place for two days, it seems that an attack against Sunday is beyond their ability.
North Korea says “in no way” it will not break apart from one-sided weapons without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister announced on Saturday that the continued sanctions would deepen its lack of trust in the United States and that there is no chance that the state would give up its nuclear weapons in a unilateral manner under these circumstances.
Ry Young Ho announced at the UN Annual General Meeting that North Korea has taken “substances of significant good will” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear missile experiments, the dismantling of the nuclear testing site and the commitment not to develop further nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
But we don't see any appropriate reaction from the United States, he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure about our national defense and under such conditions in any way and how we will not first unsecure ourselves with nuclear weapons.”
While Cherry reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about U.S. opposition to a “classified” approach to nuclear disarmament, according to which North Korea will be rewarded while taking gradual steps, his statement seems important because it has not been rejected on the threshold of nuclear disarmament, as North Korea has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint announcement released by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the top of history between a senior US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to act towards a \"nuclear dismantling of the Korean Peninsula\" while Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea sought an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States said North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States has also opposed calls to reduce international sanctions on North Korea.
\"The U.S. insists on \"nuclear disarmament first\" and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve its goal in the way of force, and even opposes \"the end of the war,\" Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can cause us to hurt our knee is a dream in the assemblage of people who are ignorant about us.
But the problem is that the terrible sanctions deepen our lack of trust.
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, the president of the U.S. in his UN speech earlier a week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korea’s leader, Mon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: “If the other side of the nuclear disarmament issue was South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear dissipation of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such an end.”
However, Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, so he told the U.N. General Assembly that the U.S. rocket attack on North Korea's missiles was inevitable after Mr. President Trump called Kim \"rocket man\" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea’s “total destruction,” praised Kim for his courage to take steps to dismantle weapons, but said there was still much work to do and that sanctions must remain in the eye until North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no set time frame, adding that \"if it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter.\"
China and Russia claimed that the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that \"the enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue with determination and without arrest until we achieve a complete and complete nuclear disarmament.\"
The Security Council has supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding of its ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare the next summit.
Pompeo has visited this year three times in North Korea, but his last visit has not been good.
He left A Fyongyang in July saying progress was made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for setting \"Gangster's requirements\"
North Korea has promised a meeting with the month's Mon to set up a missile site and a nuclear facility if the United States takes \"conforming measures\"
He said Kim told him that \"the corresponding steps\" in which he was interested include security guarantees Trump has committed to Singapore, as well as changes in the direction of normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
A new Harvard course this year teaches participants how to sleep more, in an attempt to fight the expanding Macho culture of learning by staying in cities all night with caffeine.
Academic research has found that students at the university number one in the world often have no idea about the basic principles of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Cassisler, a professor of sleep sciences at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham & Wymens Hospital, planned the course, which was the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to open the course after a lecture given about the impact of a lack of sleep on learning.
“At the end of the talk, one girl approached me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this just now, in my last school year?’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - what surprised me - he told the newspaper.
The first time this year, the course explains to students the principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improve their overall condition.
Paul Beira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and senior director of the University's health services, said the university decided to open the course after it discovered that students had suffered a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, a picture of a room appears in a dorm, where students click on coffee bowls, villas, sports clothes and books - to get explanations on the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by a lack of sleep, as well as on the importance of sleeping routine.
In another part, participants are told how persistent sleep shortages may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, if interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know it won’t change students’ behavior overnight.
But we think they have the right to know - just like you have the right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes - Prof. Chizler added.
He said that the culture of pride over “a sleepless night’s success” still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students make the problem of lack of sleep growing.
Care for adequate sleep, and good sleep quality, should be every student's \"secret weapon\" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep leads the brain to hunger, so that we are hungry all the time.
Raymond Soo, a 19-year-old California student who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chisler design the course, after participating in one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course lighted his eyes and motivated him to encourage a course for the whole campus.
The next step, which he hopes, will be to ask all advanced degree students to complete a similar teaching program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Ceasell recommended students to check the possibility of a clock to ring when it is time to go to sleep, not just for the hour when to wake up, and to be cities for the harmful effects of a “blue light” that e-emitting electronics and LED lighting, which can break the dance rhythm and thus cause problems with sleep.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Ranggers: A Gate of Manga to Jarard's Players
Ranggers suffered another attack of losing the game except when Dolly Manga caused Stephen Jarard's rebel players to defeat 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibroks hoped to win their first foreign game since the February 1-4 victory in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only lost Jarard's second in 18 games as director and left the team behind eight points after the Scottish Super League's top Harts team.
Manga attacked seven minutes before half and it didn't seem to be the inspirationless ringers.
While the Herngeers are now landing in sixth place, Livingston is climbing third and immediately after Hibernian in a gate gap.
And he may be waiting for another Ranggers Dublin after the Quantum Spence was needed for a head injury after an object was probably thrown out of the offer.
Jared made eight exchanges in the group that passed over Air to the half of the final in the Tetford Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went up with those 11 Livingston players who took a point from the Harts last week, and he could be happy with the way his players played the rivals in any situation.
Herrgers might have controlled the holding of the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball he had.
They almost captured in the second minute when Manga sent a ball to Scott Patman in a pen to Alan McGregor's gate, but a midfield player kicked the ball too far.
Then a deep free kick of Kagan Jacob found Captain Craig Allect, but his shielder Alan La Goi was able to kick only out of Cora.
Hergers did take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he had to give a judgment after a quarter-hour game, when he and Steven Wills collided, but Judge Stephen Thomson saw the plots of the Colombian actor.
He was able to kick down only twice in the first half, but Ibrux Gate, Liam Kelly, easily hit Sana Colibal and the weak shot of Obi Ajaria.
While the opening of Livingstone in the 34th minute was contrary to how the game was conducted, no one would deny that they were worthy of at least their hard work.
Once again, the Ranggers failed to deal with Jacobs' deep free ball.
Scott Artfield did not respond as Declan Gelger moved the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the wind when moving to Manga to a simple end.
Jared did a half-time act when he replaced Colibley with Ryan Kent, and the exchange led to almost immediate impact when the extreme/wing took a ball to Morlos but Kelly the impressive ran from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to force the guest team to play exactly the kind of game it likes, when Lithway and the Lect continue to send long balls.
Holt's team was able to increase the transport at other stages, but McGregor was well positioned to prevent Jacobs' experience before it was detached from the corner.
Her replacement player Glenn Middleton was later another claim of an offence against Jacobs, but Thompson again ignored.
Inventor of Mona Giger
And now stand out from Sunday Morning's story: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and continue ... the day when future physicist Johann Willalm Hans was born in Germany.
Geir developed a method that allowed identification and radioactive measurement, an invention that eventually led to a device known as Mona Giger.
Since then, the device has become a medium of science, but in 1950, it has also become a medium of pop culture thanks to the film, Bells of Coronado, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred as two strange mornings/scientists:
“What the hell is this thing?”
Rogers: This is Mona Giger, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put your ears together, you can really hear the effects of radiation on mineral atoms.
“My life, it is a bomb now!”
Hans Giger went to his world in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that carries his name continues to live after him.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and eliminate them
Immunization teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells as part of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, and the change of cells in the laboratory.
Then the cells can “see” a protein that is common to many types of cancers and then they fertilize back to the patient.
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
In one woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes extracting immune cells from the patient, changing the cells in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2 that is common to many cancers, and then injecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Brezofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Batsada, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 “moves the development of a number of cancers” including breast cancer, ovaries, vision, and colonized intestines, professor Barzofsky explained.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and learning them how to attack cancer cells has been successful in treating the type of blood cancer.
Kenya West broke out in a pro-Trump speech, headed by the MAGA hat, after his performance on SNL.
It wasn't accepted in a beautiful eye.
Kenya West responded to a boz call at the studio during a confused show on Stardy Night Live, while praising US President Donald Trump and saying he will run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song on the show, called “Guest Town,” which during his time wearing a Make America Great hat, he broke out in a protest speech against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
So many times I talk to white people who say, \"How can you love Trump, he's racist?\"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, he said.
SNL's episode began with an inscription starring Matt Diamond, in which the Hollywood star praised Bert Cavano's testimony to the Senate's legal committee, concerning accusations of sexual assault by Christine Blazy Ford.
Although the speech was not broadcast on the show, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to roll on West in advertising the thing.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had been criticized behind the scenes for the hat he wore.
“They attacked me behind the scenes.
They said, \"Don't go to the stage with this hat on your head.\"
They attacked me!
Then they said I was in a dark place, he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West went on and said, \"You want to see the dark place?\" saying he was \"holding my Superman hat, because that means nobody can tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try to show love.
His words were received at least twice by the audience, and he seemed to have been embarrassed by SNL team members, according to Variety, and one of them said to the newspaper: “The silence of Naomi fell in the entire studio.”
West is on the show as a last minute replacement instead of singer Ariana Grande, a former couple, Mac Miller, died a few days before.
Most important, he performed the song I love it when he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received backup from the Conservative Group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: \"To one of the bravest souls: thank you for not giving up on the crowd.\"
But serving the Actuality Program Hunter wrote on Twitter that \"there was someone who was who was, and that's totally wonderful.\"
“But I chose not to reward (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his art), which I think is an effort and an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we - she added.
Before the show, Harper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now he was \"the entity that was previously known as Kenya West\".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the names of Didy, also known as Pope Didy, Pope and P Didy.
Another rapper, Snoop Doc, held the name of Snove Lyon, and of course the famous musician Prince changed his name to the symbol and then to an artist who was once known as Prince.
Indictment of attempted murder due to a crackdown at a Blefest restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Albert on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Balya.
The suspect is expected to appear before the Belfest court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the public prosecution service.
Star Game of Thrones, Keith Harrington, Attacks Poisoning Males
Kit Hinton is recognized as John Snow Sculpture Sculpture Sculpture from the series of violent medieval fantasy of throne games.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the Macho hero's stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen often convey young children's message that they must be tough to respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought something was wrong and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic maleity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married another star in the throne games, Rose Lesley, who is 31 years old, admitted he was “very worried” about dealing with this issue.
\"I feel very worried right now -- where did we get wrong on the way about maleity?\" he said.
“What do we teach men during their growth, from the point of view of the problem we are witnessing now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for an increase in toxic maleity due to the very male figures she presents.
He continued: “What comes from inside and what we learn from outside?
What do we learn from television, and on the street, that makes young kids feel they have to be on this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time -- how does it change?
There is no doubt that something went wrong for young men.
In an interview, he admitted that he would not participate in any continuing series or derivative series of throne games after the series was finished next summer, saying he was \"final with combat fields and horses\".
From November to November, Keith will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's play \"Real West\", which tells the story of film producer and his brother the robbery.
The player recently found out that he saw his wife Rose as the best thing that happened as a result of the throne games.
“I knew my wife in the series, so this way the series gave me my future family, and my life from that moment forward,” he said.
Rose played the role of Yigrit, the property of John Snow's love, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The two married in June 2018 at Lesley's Family Courtyard in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent drop in its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are sick, according to official health care.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been infected as a result of having sex, which is a change from the past.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in certain parts of China as a result of infected blood vessels.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, according to official health officials in China at a conference in Yunan County.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV infection as a result of having sex is a burning problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality ceased to be anti-law in China in 1997, but it was said that discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who had sex with men would eventually marry women.
Many cases of infection are the result of insufficient protective measures in these sex relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a man from her team leaked information about Republican Santorism and protects the \"dangerous lies\" and \"conspiration theories\"
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected the accusations that a member of her team had published personal information about three U.S. Senators on the Wikipedia pages of the Senators.
Democratic Senator from Los Angeles estimated that claims are distributed by “extreme right-wing” websites and visitors.
“Breaking, lying, and other lies are hated,” said Waters in a Twitter announcement.
According to the reports, the information published included the residence addresses and telephone numbers of American Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both of whom are Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, and was published by an unknown person at the Capitol Hill during the hearing with the Senate Committee on allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour against the Supreme Court judge, Bert Kavano.
The leak took place some time after the three Senators asked Kovano.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was related to Waters' office and published the information about a member of Waters team, according to Hill's report.
“This baseless accusation is completely wrong and a complete lie” added Waters.
My team member, his identity and personal details, were exposed and his security was damaged as a result of these false allegations and errors, he was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless accusation is completely wrong and a complete lie.
Waters' announcement quickly drew online criticism, including former White House press secretary Ari Flycher.
“It’s an angry denial,” Flycher wrote.
“This shows that she doesn’t have the weather required by Congressional members.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he can't react angryly.
He's not allowed to respond with enthusiasm.
He cannot doubt the motives of the accused.
He must be calm and calm.
It seemed that Feliche was comparing Waters' response to the criticism of the Democrats of the judge Kavano, whom he accused of being too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navaro, a Republican candidate who is trying to defeat Waters in the mid-term election, also raised his thoughts on Twitter.
“It’s great if it’s the truth,” he wrote on Twitter.
In her announcement, Waters said that she had turned to the appropriate authorities and law enforcement officials for these false claims.
\"We will make sure that the criminals are discovered,\" she continued, \"and they will stand up for all their destructive and dangerous actions against my team members.\"
Review of the film \"Joni English 3.0\" - Pedagogical Pedagogical Freud starring Ron Atkinson
It is now accepted to look for meanings about Brexit in every new film with a British perspective, and it does seem to fit into this repertoire of the action-commity predition in the Johnny English series, which began there in 2003 with Johnny Ingelish and woke up back to life in 2011 with Johnny Ingelish returning.
Is an iron self-sacrificing self-sacrifice on how much we are not worth becomes our country's new export opportunity?
In any case, Johnny Ingelish, the slomish with the eyes and the rubber face, got another chance to break things - and his name symbolizes more than that is a broad comedy work designed for cinematists in non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, he's a stupid English agent, who, despite his strange face-to-face, seems a little bit like Cluzzo, a little bit more between and a lot of this guy who contributed a unique character to the taste of fire trains in the London Olympics' opening text in 2012.
It is also originally based on the mysterious international passenger who played Atkinson in the forgotten television commercials of Barclycard, who left chaos behind.
There's one or two nice minutes in the last edition of Johnny Ingelish.
I loved the thing that Johnny Ingelish was approaching the helicopter wearing a middle-aged armor, and the impulse cores ring for moments on his helmet.
Atkinson shows his comedy physical abilities, but humor feels rather weak and strange, especially because the “responsible” type of spying films like 007 and an impossible task in themselves now includes a comedy component.
Humor feels like he turns to children instead of adults, and for the crazy failed adventures of Johnny Ingelish are less brilliant and focused on jokes in Atkinson's dark movie style as Mr. Ben.
The film begins when a major danger threatens Britain.
Computer hacks into the super secret internet of British espionage and reveals the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the anxiety of the main agent - a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last difficulty for a prime minister in a arrogant and hostile character, who already suffers from a complete collapse of political popularity loss: Emma Thompson does her best to play the role of Teresa May, but she has nothing to do with the script.
Her intelligence advisors tell her that since every active spy is exposed, she's gonna have to bring someone back from retirement.
And that means Johnny Ingelish Herbian in her dignity and in itself, now employed as a school manager in a prestigious institution, but gives unofficial lessons on how to be a secret spy: how many good jokes here, when English offers an Academy for Spying in the school rock style.
Inglysh is brought back to Whithore for an emergency instruction and reunited with his former assistant to the suffering Buff, whom Ben Miller once again plays.
Buff is now a man married to a submarine commander, acting as an angry “king of the class” on which Vico Pendin is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin of the Knesset of Her Majesty's Secret Service for a terrible problem return to action, while Pam-Pattal is beautiful in the image of Ophelia, with which Olega Corylenko portrays.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the charms of a billionaire of crypto-tech that claims he can solve the UK's computer problems - the evil Jason Volta in Jake Lacey's release.
Inglish and Buff start with their own analytics which are more than a handful of two clowns: in the shadow of waiters, they fire a superb French restaurant; they create an Andremossy when they smuggle themselves into the magnificent yacht of Volta; and English from a pure anarchy in his attempt to use a virtual reality kit to learn to know the interior structure of Volta's house.
There is no doubt that all efforts are made to lead to the last sequence, but despite the love and contempt, it has a sense of television for children.
A pretty medium level.
And like the other Johnny Ingelish films, I couldn't help thinking: couldn't the British film industry give Ryan Atkinson a role that really does justice with his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is preparing a plan for the British to work four days a week but gets paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a revolutionary plan that the British will work four days a week, but will receive a five-day payment.
According to reports, the party wants corporate managers to transfer the savings as a result of the AI revolution to employees in the form of another day of rest.
I mean, employees will have a three-day weekend, and they will still receive the same salary.
Sources said that the idea of “fits” the company’s economic agenda and plans to guide the country for the benefit of workers.
The trade union Congress supports a four-day transition to a four-day work week as a way that workers can enjoy the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour party source told Sunday Times: “In a policy policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a desire that suits the party’s approach to rebalance the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the Party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party called for a four-day work week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, the ambition is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day work week is not a party policy and the party doesn’t consider it.
The Labour Minister, John McDonnell, took advantage of the party conference last week to formulate his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to put back power from “faceless managers” and “price-makers” in service companies.
The plans of the candidate for the Minister of Finance are also due to the fact that current shareholders in water companies may not receive their full investment because the Labour government may do \"reducing\" on the basis of the discovery of inappropriate behaviour.
He also confirms that there are plans for France to work for company board members and create \"totally-owned funds\" to transfer 10% of the private sector's capital to workers, who will have entered into a two-year bond of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told the TV show 60 minutes if the FBI's investigation of our situation will change their mind.
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Burt Kwano delayed his final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court at least one week, and raised the question of whether the findings of the investigation could convince the Republicans to withdraw his support.
In an idea aired on Sunday on the 60-minute show, Scott Fly asked Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their mind.
It seems that Kennedy was more open than his fellow South Carolina party.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
I said in front of the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Quano.
I called him after it happened, that the charge went up, and I said, \"Did you do it?\"
He was determined, determined, and unimportant.
In contrast, Graham's vote seems to be in the rock.
\"I've already decided about Bert Kavano and there's going to be a need for a broken charge,\" he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Bert denied it in effect, said Graham, referring to Christine Blazy Ford.
“Even a man she mentioned could not verify it.
That's 36 years old.
I can’t see how something can change.
What is the world’s citizens’ festival and did it make a contribution to reducing poverty?
The New York Saturday will date the world’s citizens’ festival, an annual music event with the most impressive list of stars that will appear and an impressive goal of ending poverty in the world.
The world’s citizens’ festival, which takes place for the seventh time, will bring tens of thousands of people who have been burned to a major lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of the event - to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Civil Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless you are willing to pay for the VIP card), the concert island must complete a series of tasks, or “actions” such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, calling or other significant ways to help increase awareness for the purpose of ending poverty.
But how successful did the festival really get, when only 12 more years before it achieve its goal?
Does the idea of giving a free ticket to a concert for people really make it a way to convince them to demand a call for action, or is it another case of \"climatism\" -- people who feel like they really influence them signing up on a huge online or sending a tweet on Twitter?
Since 2011, the world’s citizens’ organization has said that more than 19 million “actions” have been documented by its supporters, pushing for a variety of different goals.
These actions have helped Draven world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.5 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and declarations as a result of its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already started in distribution or fundraising.
The group estimates that funds so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and actors committed to “help children grow up to their full potential” and promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the state’s nutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets on Twitter from “the world’s citizens.”
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and ‘world citizens’ like you, we can turn social justice on the subject of sub-nutrition into a marginal observation in history,” said the Ambassador to the public during the London Concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions called on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the project's budget, Power of Nutrition, to reach 5 million women and children with nutrition intervention.
In response to one of the most common questions on their website that you ask, “What makes you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?”
\"The citizens of the world\" replied: \"It will be a long and difficult route -- sometimes we fall down and fail.
But, like the great movements before us of civil rights and resistance to apartheid, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B and Janel Monet are among some of the performances that took place at the New York year's event, which will be served by Deborah-Le Forens and Joe Jackman.
U.S. can use the Navy for \"sea closure\" to delay Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
“If needed, Washington can use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, as U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zink said in Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that the Russian involvement in Syria, which is made, is important to mention, in order of the legal government, is an excuse to spread to new energy markets.
I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern abdomen of Europe, he said.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States is able, with our fleet, to make sure that the sea routes are open and when it is necessary to impose a siege to ensure that their energy sources do not reach the market,” he said.
Zinky turned to the event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the \"power consumer voice\" in the United States.
He continued his remarks and compared Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they were indeed identical.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the leverage and replacement of fuel types,” he said, referring to Russia as a “pony of one trick” because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration is on a mission to increase its export of heavy natural gas to Europe, while replacing Russian energy sources, which are much cheaper for European consumers.
For this reason, Trump's government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to cancel its participation in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, according to Trump, that made Berlin a \"wrong\" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the US$11 billion pipeline project, which is supposed to double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion square meters, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's firm opposition to a project is driven solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we are partners in the view that energy cannot be a tool for applying pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian energy minister Alexander Novak after meeting in Moscow with U.S. Secretary of Energy, Rick Fry, in September.
The U.S. position has received a response against the harshness of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industry Organization (BDI), the leading organization in the German industry, called on the United States to keep away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kampf, head of the German Industry Organization (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren “Respectly Consider” the 2020 presidential run, said Senator from Massachusetts
Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would “consider seriously” the possibility of running for president after the presidential election.
Warren confirmed the intention to run for president during a meeting in Hollyuk, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government, and for this reason, there’s a need for a woman to stand in the head,” she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will seriously consider the presidential race.
Warren expressed her opinion on President Donald Trump during the city meeting, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
I'm worried until the breast of my bones about what Donald Trump does to our democracy - she said.
Warren repeatedly visited Trump for the appointment of Bert Quano as a judge in the Supreme Court.
In a tweet released on Friday, Warren said, \"Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.\"
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that most Warren's choices themselves do not think she should run for the 2020 election.
Fifty-eight percent of the \"potential\" voters in Massachusetts said that the Senator should not run for elections, according to a survey by the Center for Political Research of the University of Sapook and the Boston Globe newspaper.
Thirty-two percent supported the intention of dealing with the presidency of the Senator.
The survey showed that there was more support for former governor D'Eval Patrick's run, with 38% supporting his run against 48% against her.
Equipped figures from the Democratic Party that oil has risen in connection with possible fights for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision in January, according to IPA reports.
Sarah Pylin points out the post-traumatic stress disorder of Trak Pylin in the arrest of Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Trak Phylin stayed for a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with family violence on Monday night.
“What’s going on with my son, what’s going on since he came back, allows me to identify with families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD disorder and some of the injuries that our soldiers are returning to,” she told the audience of participants in the arrest for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pylin called the arrest \"the elephant in the room\" and said of her son and other freed soldiers, \"They're slightly different again, they're back hard, they're going back and wondering if what they gave to the country is their soldiers and airmen, and all the other military personnel are respected.\"
He was arrested on Monday in the city of Wessila, Alaska, and was charged with assault and family violence against a woman, disrupting the report of family violence and holding weapons under pay, according to Dan Bennett, a Wesila police spokesman.
18 countries and the District of Columbia support the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighty-eight countries and the District of Columbia support the call for a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to provide shelter to victims fleeing from situations where gang violence or family violence is involved.
Representatives from 18 countries and the District have filled out a “Journal Friend” statement on Friday in Washington to support the challenge of the asylum seekers’ policy, according to NBC report.
The full name of the complainant in Grace v. Sashens' lawsuit filed by the U.S. Civil Rights Association in August was not revealed.
She said her partner, \"and his violent sons, members of the gang, have abused her, but officials in the U.S. government rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace's state ministers described the countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, of which a large number of asylum applications are submitted in the United States, as nations dealing with many problems in relation to gangs and family violence.
The new policy of U.S. political asylum abolished a 2014 decision of the BIA Migration Appeals Council that allowed uncertified migrants fleeing family violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia County Attorney General Carl Resin said in a statement on Sunday that the new policy \"is ignoring dozens of years of state laws, federal and international laws.\"
“The federal law requires that all discussions on asylum requests be based on the facts and special circumstances of the request, and the barrier set by the new policy violates this principle” is stated in the statement “The friend of the court.”
The lawyers also claimed that policy, preventing the entry of migrants, is damaging the U.S. economy, because they tend to become entrepreneurs and “provide needed work” to them.
Attorney General Jeff Sashens ordered immigration judges not to give more political asylum to victims fleeing family abuse and gang violence in June.
“The political asylum is open to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of racial, religious, national or social group membership or political opinion,” Sashens said in a statement on the policy he said on June 11.
The goal of the political asylum would never have been to alleviate all problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
A desperate rescue effort in Palo, while the murder rate is doubled, in the race to find survivors.
For the survivors the situation has become more difficult than a moment.
“There’s a very tense feeling,” said 35-year-old Risa Cosmos, and if a baby is warmed up at the center of the corner of the destroyed city Palo.
Every moment the ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is rare.
Residents looked back to their destroyed homes, flowing between water-supposed objects, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged by a 7.5-strong earthquake, were flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Dove Harris, who suffered back and shoulder crises, lay outside of Palo's military hospital, where they received treatment due to strong subatomical shocks that continued after the earthquake.
Tears filled his eyes when he told how he felt the violent earthquake shocked the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the wall ruins, I think -- Harris told the I.P. Agency, adding that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife crying for help, and then she was silenced.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are in a safe place.
U.S. ambassador accuses China of \"brains\" with \"propaganda ads\"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper released a four-page ad on American daily, with aggressive promotion of the benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press for propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump, on Wednesday, referred to the pay-up of the Chinese newspaper China Daily, de Mowine Register, the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere with the November 6 US Congress election, claimed that China had been rejected.
Trump's accusation that China was trying to intervene in the U.S. election marked a new stage, according to U.S. official sources, in Washington's escalation campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is natural that foreign governments will publish ads for trade promotion, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a Goa Trade War where every country rises and compares customs rates on products imported from their country.
Customs prices, which China has raised as a reward in an early stage of the trade war, are intended to harm exports from countries such as Iowa, who have supported the Republican Party of Trump, U.S. and Chinese experts said.
Terry Burnstad, a former U.S. ambassador to China, former Governor of Iowa for many years, and an important export of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hit workers, farmers and American businesses.
China, Princestad wrote in an article in the Sunday edition of de Mowine Register, “encouraging the act of intelligence by publishing ads in our free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses America’s tradition of freedom of speech and precious press, and publishes paid ads in de Moin Register,” Bernstein wrote.
“On the other hand, at the newspaper stand on the Beijing streets, you will find little opposition voices and will not see any true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people may have on the worrying economic track, given that media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.”
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers has avoided the offer to publish” his statement, although he did not mention what newspaper it is.
The Republican Party takes women's voices away before the mid-election with the Quano incident, analytics warnings
While many of the Republican party leaders stand side by the candidate for the Supreme Court and defend him against the number of allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see a response against, especially women, during the next mid-election.
The emotions around this were particularly alive, and most Republicans formally demonstrate their desire to move forward in the voting process.
“This kind of thing cannot be returned,” said Grant Rihr, a professor of state science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxoll School for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Rihr said he questioned that the last moment of Senator Jeff Flick's efforts (from the Republican Party in Arizona) to open an FBI investigation would be enough to cast angry voters.
\"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday -- they're not going to forget it tomorrow, not November,\" said Karen Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national speaker of the MoveOn, according to Washington D.C.
In the morning of 6th, protesters read \"November's voice\" when they showed up at the Senate Hall, while the Republicans controlling the Senate's Justice Committee chose to continue to promote Quano's appointment, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford, according to a report from the site.
“The levels of enthusiasm and democratic motivation will break new records,” he told the news site Sto Rotenberg, a non-party political analyst.
“People say they’ve been high; they’re right.
But they can be higher, especially among the voices of women in perfection and among young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, despite their lack of affection for the president, often abstain from voting.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which dismissed her allegations of the candidate's sexual assault into the Supreme Court, analysts claimed that it was possible for the Republicans to continue to promote the nomination.
“The appointment has caused Republicans to have serious problems,” said Michael Steele, chairman of the former National Republican Committee, in the beginning of last week, the NBC news channel.
“It’s not just a committee vote or a final vote or if Quano receives the appointment, but also how the Republicans dealt with it and how they acted to it,” he said to the news channel Gi Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to select Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided as to how much they believe in the testimony of Ford and Quano, with a slightly higher support for Ford.
A recent survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed in or probably for Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed in certainty or probably in Kuwait.
In addition, 38% said they thought that Quana was lying or probably during his testimony, while only 30% said it about Ford.
After Flick's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as the allegations raised by at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramrez, according to the Guardian newspaper.
Ford testified in a oath to the Senate’s legal committee last week that he had attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramerez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court exposed Aber to her during a party she attended at Yale University in the 1980s.
Global Internet Inventor Plans to Start A New Web Network To Overcome Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, a global web developer, is launching a start-up company to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
Inrupt, the last man's project that has become a legend in the world of technology, is a company that develops Solid, Berners-Lee's open code platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who are allowed to access the different types of data.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is “world control”
“We have to do it now,” he said about the start-up.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create a “personal online database” or pod.
The database will include a list of contacts, lists of actions for execution, schedule, library of music and other personal and professional tools.
Imagine that Google Drive, Microsoft Autolock, Slack and Spotify will all be available on one browser, at the same time.
What specializes in the personal online database is that only the user decides who can access the information and what type of information can be accessed.
The company calls it “personalization through data”
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the intention is that Inrupt will find the right resources, process and capabilities to help access Solid to everyone.
Today, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team that includes several developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer code programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world will be able to create distributed apps using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not discussing with Facebook and Google about their consent or refusal to make a complete change, which will make a complete and overnight transformation of all their business models.
“We don’t ask them for permission.
On Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an environmental system to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the internet when he founded the W3C network's proper organization at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice that has influenced the debate on network neutrality.
Also during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as the founder and director of W3C, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I am particularly optimistic about the next era of the network,” said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: An Event in the First World War of Victoria
The only cleric of the English Church who won the Victoria Cross during World War I was mentioned at a 100-year event in his hometown of birth.
Deputy Champion and Pastor Bernard Van won the Victoria Cross on September 29, 1918 for his participation in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had won the highest British honor.
The victory stone was revealed by his two grandchildren, in a parade at the head of the Northampton district, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said that the discovery of the stone exactly 100 after his grandfather won the mark of excellence was a “surprisingly symmetry”
According to the London Gazett newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Deputy Chief Van led his regiment and crossed the San Canton Canal \"through heavy fog and under heavy fire from field and sub-gun cannons.\"
Then he rushed to the fire line and \"The Greatest Knights\" led the line forward before he was forced to take one hand over the sub-gun and dropped three from the party.
Deputy Chief Van was killed by a German submarine on October 4, 1918, one month before the war ended.
Michael Van's 72-year-old said that his grandfather's actions were \"something I know I'll never be able to match with, but something that's sparking me humility.\"
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also placed a stranger after the march, which led to Brentwood's Royal Youth Orchestra.
Michael Van said he was \"very honored to take part in the march\" and added that \"the hero's hero's courage is demonstrated in support given to many people.\"
The combined martial arts fans stayed in cities all night to watch Blator 206, instead receiving Peppe Pig.
Imagine that you've stayed in cities all night to watch Baltor 206's action, and eventually watching the main event is denied to you.
The program included 13 battles, including six on the main card, and was broadcast live during the night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Jagard Musassi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the battle, the viewers in the UK remained shocked when the poll changed to Peppe Pig.
Some of them were not impressed by the change after cities were left until the early morning hours to watch the battle.
One fan on Twitter described the transition to a children's film as \"a kind of sick joke\"
“It was a government facility that said at 6 a.m. the original content was inappropriate, so they had to move to the children’s plans,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication in the Blator, when asked about the broadcast.
Puppy Pig, yeah.
Blator’s president, Scott Coker, said they intend to work on their schedules to include future British viewers.
“I think when I think about the re-broadcast, I think we can solve it,” Coker said.
“But the time is 6 a.m. on Sunday, where we cannot solve the problem until Sunday in our time zone, i.e. on Sunday in their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me that during the transition many text messages were exchanged between the parties and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But no, it was a government problem.
I can assure you that next time it's not going to happen.
We only clean five battles instead of six -- as we usually do -- we tried to give the fans more and simply overrun.
It's a matter of unluckiness.
\"Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt \"nause\" because of his sexual orientation.
Tom Daily, the Olympic jumper of water, said that during his teenage years he felt inferior to others because of his sexual orientation - but that feeling gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old jumper said he didn't know until he reached the middle class that \"not everyone like me\"
In an interview given on Radio Channel 4's Desert Island Discs, under Laurent Lowren, he said he expressed his opinion on gay rights to give others \"Hope\".
He also said that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympic Games.
The old program's regular mentor, Christie Young, went on a six-month illness break.
In his appearance as the first show star of Lauren, Daily said that he felt \"satisfied\" and so the others grew up because \"it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls.\"
He said: “To this day, the feeling of landing, and the different feeling, were real things that gave me the power and strength and allowed me to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was \"something\" he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when he eventually found out what his sexual orientation was.
The man who won twice the Hard Olympic Medal became a stable leader of the LGBT community campaign and used his participation in the British Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on other countries to give legal status to homosexuals.
He expressed openly on the subject because he was lucky to have been given the opportunity to live openly and without consequences and wanted to give others “ hope.”
The third winner of the World Championship said that falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, \" caught me in surprise.\"
Daily married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years old last year, but he said the old man never had a problem.
\"When you're going through so much at such a young age -- he first played the Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone at his age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, a white named Robert Ray Black Daily, and Daily said that his \"every point of view\" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it’s all about ‘I have to win a gold medal’ he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily said his father did not accept the fact that he was about to die and that one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You won’t be here to be in the first line, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand while his breathing stopped, and only when he stopped breathing really and I finally knew he wasn’t unwinning,” he said.
A year later, Daily competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the Red Medal.
“I just knew that I’ve dreamed about it my whole life - to dive into my home audience in the Olympic Games, there wasn’t a good feeling of that,” he said.
That's also what inspired him to choose his first song - Brother Small's Proud - which he identified during the preparation of the Olympic Games and still makes him a duck skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15, according to the British Summer Watch.
Michaelson is down to the bench during the Raider Cup on Saturday.
American golfer Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays the 47th time at the Ryder Cup, but he will have to upgrade his performance so that the event will not become a sign of a miserable way.
Michaelson, who participates in the 12th annual double event, has fallen to the bench according to Jim Fyric's decision during the football games and the four four-balls (foursomes) on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he used to play with the U.S. team, Michaelson, who won five times the Major tournament, spent half of the day encouraging and the second half working on his game in the opposite direction in the hope of repairing the ill-equipped evil he suffered from.
Even at the height of his career, the player's performance has suffered from insurgency and uplifting. So, the 48-year-old Michaelson is not the ideal choice for La Golf National, where long grass tracks are not usually forgiving to kicks.
And if the competition itself is not sufficiently worrisome, Michaelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, competes against the exact British champion, Francesco Molinari, who co-starred with the starter Tommy Fletwood and won all four of their games this week.
If the ambition of the Americans, who lost four points at the beginning of 12 games, had been to succeed in the first stages, the game could have been decisive.
Fyric expressed confidence in his actor, although we didn't expect him to say anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, washed my back, wrapped his arm around me, and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Fyric said.
He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has added a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's how it evolved, and that's how we thought we should go on.
He wanted to be on the track, just like all other players.
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record with the highest number of games in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may end his career at the Reider Cup, which has never really matched his personal peaks.
Michaelson's victory stands for 18 wins, 20 losses and seven skirts, although Pyric said his presence added some intangible advantages to the team.
“He’s fun, sexy, snorkeling, he likes to make fun of people, and fun to be with him in the dressing room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed having fun with him this week, and it was nice to see it.
It has a lot beyond the game itself.
European Captain Thomas Bourne knows that the big advantage may disappear soon.
Thomas Bourne, the European captain, knows from experience a significant advantage before the last day in the single Raider Cup game may change badly.
The Danish player began his career in the game in Waldrama in 1997, when the white couple to the game, Father Balstros, had a 5-point advantage over the Americans, who almost lost it with a minor advantage and won 141-2-131-2.
“I keep reminding myself that we had a great advantage in Waldrama; we had a great advantage in the game in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in the Waldrama we won, but with a minor advantage,” said Bourne, in the picture, after watching the 5-3 win in the 2018 tournament both on Friday and yesterday, which led to the 10-6 B.B. Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
We have to give everything tomorrow.
We need to go on track and do all the right things.
It's not over until the points don't appear on the board.
We have a goal, try to win the Cup, and we need to focus on it.
I said all the way, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of those who stand in front of us on the other side -- the best players in the world.
Bourne was happy with the performance of his players on the hard golf track and added: \"It's important for me not to get ahead later with the golf.
Tomorrow can be completely different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on personal performance, and it's completely different.
It's a pleasure to be on the track when everything goes well, but when you're there alone, then your full ability as a golf player stands on the test.
And that's the message to be passed on to the players: you need to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind, and he needs to make the best of himself.
Unlike Bourne, rival captain Jim Fyric will expect better personal performance than his players, compared to their performance in the couple games, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Pyric himself knows both the winning side and the losing side, during the important final days of such tournaments, after he participated in the winning team in Brooklyn before he lost, when the European team that won a miracle in the final game, as recorded in the film Miracle at Medinah.
“I remember every word and word,” he said in response to the question of how Ben-Krensu, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players towards the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but I want to succeed in the first stages, as you have seen in Brooklyn, and as you have seen in Medinah.
When this momentum moves to one side, it runs a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We're preparing our vehicle accordingly and raising the guys to orbit according to the feeling we have, you know, we're trying to make magic tomorrow.
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the fight and he will face Rory McLroy in the top game, with Paul Cassie, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fletwood and Ian Pulter, who are the rest of the Europeans in the top half.
“I chose this team of players because I think he’ll be able to bring us to an end,” Bourne said when referring to his only choice.
Germany's new warship was rejected again.
Germany's new naval frigate was to be accepted in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War period, but it was rejected at least annually due to damaged and cost-effective systems, the local media reported.
Rheinland-Pfalz's reception, the new Baden-Wuertemberg-class frigate line, has now been rejected until the first half of 2019, according to a report by the newspaper Di Tate, quoted by a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying issues after the supply ended the wave on the ambitious project.
The four ships of Baden-Wuertemberg-class, which were also available in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to include powerful cannons, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile batteries as well as malicious technologies, such as acoustic signatures, infrareds and reduced radar.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - the newest frigates can be spread for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the meaning of repeated delays is that the innovative ships, which are supposed to allow Germany to send overseas forces, will already become obsolete until the moment they enter service, pointed out quite a bit.
The F125 was hit by headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to Bloomm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy had brought a ship back to the ship after its delivery.
Not much is known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media quoted a number of critical \"software and hardware\" that made the warship useless for the use of a combat mission.
The software malfunctions were particularly important since the Baden-Wuertemberg-class fleet would be operated by about 120 sailors - about half of the crew used in the older Bremen class.
In addition, it has been found that the ship has a dramatic excess weight that reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add improvements in the future.
The weight of the Rheinland-Pfalz ship is 7,000 tons, and it is two times as heavy as the Germans used it in World War II.
In addition to the damaged software, the price label of the entire project - including the team training - also becomes a problem.
It reached a shocking rise of € 3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion) over the original € 2.2 billion.
The problems that trigger the newest frigates become particularly thought-provoking in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartles, head of the German Parliament’s Security Committee, confirmed that today, the Navy’s “shipholds capable of executing”
The official source said that the problem was gaining momentum and increased over time, as old ships were out of service but were not replaced by other vessels.
He expressed his regret that it was not possible for the Navy to annex any Baden-Wuertemberg-class frigate.
The National Fund of Scotland listens to the secret life of the bats
A new study conducted in the estate in the Scotland Harriet seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt their food.
The hope is that the findings will re-improve the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The research conducted by scientists at the National Fund of Scotland will follow European bats and bats as well as the brown and long-eared Dobenton bats in the Inbrio Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be located on key sites around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
The National Health Service (NHS) team and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
Specialized voice analysis of all recordings will determine the frequencies of bat readings and who are responsible for them.
Next, a map of the living areas will be selected to create a detailed picture of the size of the landscape, of their behavior patterns.
Most emails, a nature conservation consultant for the National Fund of Scotland (NTS) hope the results will find out which areas of living are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management work of living areas, such as the creation of broccoli and how to best keep forest areas for bats and other related species.
The population of the bats in Scotland and throughout the UK has been significantly reduced over the last century.
They are under threat from development and construction works, which affect the storage and loss of living areas.
Wind turbines and lighting may also be a risk, and this is also true for some flight traps and chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their night fishing habits, bat ears are more useful in hunting prey.
They use a sophisticated technique of detection using a cloth to detect insects and identify obstacles to their flight path.
The NTS Foundation, which is responsible for the treatment of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 760,000 acres of land across the country, refers to bats very seriously.
She has 10 skilled experts, who regularly conduct surveys, screening tests and sometimes also rescue.
The organization also established the first and only reserve dedicated to bats at Triv in Dempris and Gallavi, which serves as a home for eight out of Scotland's ten species of bats.
House manager David Thompson said the estate was the ideal territory for them.
\"Here's Pet Riv, we have a great area for bats,\" he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the appropriate living areas.
But many things are not yet known about the bats, so the work we do here and other assets will help us understand more what they need to thrive.
He stressed the importance of testing for the detection of bats before carrying out maintenance work within the assets, as unintended destruction of a single-insulated nest could destroy up to 400 females, and a whole local population could also be destroyed.
The bats are protected sex and killing, harassment and disruption to bats or destruction of their nesting areas, prohibited by law.
Elizabeth Pearl, a Scottish officer at the bat conservation fund, encouraged the public to give their shoulder and help.
She said: “We have a lot more to learn about our bats and many of our species we just don’t know what their population is.
Ronaldo cancels rape charges while lawyers are preparing to sue German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo called the rape charges against him “Pake News” and said people wanted to “promot themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue German news magazine der Spigel, who has published the charges.
The pioneer of the Portuguese and Vivantus teams was accused of rape by an American woman named Catherine Murga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, according to Dr. Spigel's report.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo turned to his 142 million followers on Instagram in video live a few hours after the allegations were published and called for a \"Pake News\" report.
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said yesterday, Pike News, said to the player who won Balloon D'Or five times.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy person and everything is good - the player added a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Dr. Spigel for the charges, to which they have referred as \"unacceptable reports of privacy suspicions\" according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for \"moral damages according to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.\"
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in the Suite of Casino Palms Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Mirega returned, according to the report, to the actor's room and the actor allegedly raped her, according to documents submitted to Clark County Court in Novada.
Moregha claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told her he was a \"good guy\" in 99 percent who was disappointed with \"one percent.\"
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that they had agreed.
Moraga also claims that she contacted the police and pictures of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but then she agreed to settle outside the walls of the court because she felt “suffering from revenge” and was afraid to be publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old says she now wants to cancel the arrangement because she still suffers from trauma due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, and moved to the Italian Yoventus club in a deal worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK \"respect forever\" for vehicle manufacturers' loss
Britain will \"forget forever\" if you lose its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Britain's business minister Greg Clark said.
He added that Toyota's interview with the BBC, where he said if the UK left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at Princeton's factory, near Derby, was a \"dig.\"
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that the effect of delays on borders in the event of a Brexit without an agreement could rise in jobs.
The Princeton plant, which produces the models of Oris and Avantis of Toyota, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% are coming to the rest of the EU.
“From my point of view, if Britain comes out without an agreement from the European Union at the end of March, we will see the cessation of production at our factory,” said Martin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Princeton.
Other UK car manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how it will affect cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW, and Viguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its \"mini\" factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are what car manufacturers call “the risks of the supply chain” in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line is run on a “just in time” basis with parts coming every 37 minutes, British suppliers and the rest of the European Union to produce cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, it could cause trouble on the border, and factors in the sector say they could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
Toyota will not be able to hold a stock worth more than one day at a Derbyshire factory, says the company, so production will stop.
Clarke said the Teresa May's plan, detailing Britain's future relations with the European Union, was \"confirmed precisely to prevent these tests at the border.\"
“We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement we can, as I said, not only to enjoy success in the present, but also to take advantage of the opportunity” he said on the Today program on BBC Radio 4
“The evidence from Toyota and other car manufacturers is that the possibility of continuing to use the successful supply chain system, which has been at our disposal to date, is absolutely essential.”
Toyota didn’t say how long the production stopped, but for the longer term, she warned that the extra costs would be detrimental to the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately would cause dismissals.
Peter Zuvalaris, who has worked in Barnaston for 24 years, and serves as president of the Union at the factory, said members of the association are increasingly concerned: “From my experience, if jobs are reduced, they will never be returned.
A government spokesman said: “We have offered an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the European Union.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be rejected again, says White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, many dependent on it, could \"depose another week\" while fighting the candidate for the Supreme Court, Bert Kavano, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian intervention in elections, ties between Trump and Russia’s assistants and a possible disruption of the president’s investigation proceedings.
Dating in Washington for months about whether Trump would fire the Deputy Attorney General and risk Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of carrying a compliance device to record talks with Trump and cause the president to reject the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on the last day he came to the White House, and according to the reports he was to resign.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for Trump's day, when Rosenstein arrived in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would \"fear not\" to fire Rosenstein, but at this point the meeting was rejected to prevent a collision with the Senate's legal committee, where Kawano and one of the women accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior, Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week's investigation into claims against Kavano, and again rejected the vote in the Senate.
Trump's spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
In response to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “We have not yet set a date for the meeting, it may take place this week, I can see a rejection of another week given the situation in the Supreme Court.
But I’m always happy to update the press.
Some reporters will challenge this determination: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the rareness of the training was not due to the \"depression\" of the television, although she said: \"I will not deny the fact that they are taking a position.\"
She then proposed to increase Trump’s direct connection to the press.
\"The president has more questions and answers than any president before,\" she said, adding without citing evidence: \"We've checked the numbers.\"
Press releases will still take place, Sanders said, but if the press has a chance to put questions directly to the president of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We tried to do so in many cases, and you've seen that we've done so in many cases in recent weeks, and meetings that will allow us to talk to the president of the United States, will replace the press guides.
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open meetings or for journalists' parties during important visits.
Only for his journalists are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated the reason for this, at a free performance and sometimes strange to reporters gathered instead.
The Health Service writes to European Union employees in NHS Scotland and addresses concerns about Brexit
The health ministry wrote to the staff of workers from the European Union, employed in the National Health Service of Scotland, to express the gratitude of the country and to ask them to remain after Brexit.
Scottish parliamentary company Jean Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain’s exit from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to the ownership of applications for permanent status for European Union citizens working in its distributed public services.
Ms. Freeman wrote in a letter: “Over the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the exit continued, and it is moving forward towards the expected decisions in the fall.
But the UK government has also increased its readiness for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this time may be very worrying for all of you.
So I wanted to go back and say how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the team, regardless of his nationality.
Fellows from all over the European Union and the world bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercomby undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injury
The back shield from the University of Tennessee tiger group, Christion Abercomby, underwent emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury from the 31-27 Saturday loss to the Wanderblit Community Group, Mike Organ of the Tensian reported.
Rod Reed, chief coach of the University of Tennessee group, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half.
“He went to the courts and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
The coaches and the medical team gave them oxygen blessings on the floor and then brought it up on Alonka and took it for further examination.
An official from the University of Tennessee told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, who was transferred to surgery at the Wenderblit Medical Center.
Harris added that “there is still no details about the type/range of surgery” and Tennessee University is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abracombi is an athlete student and this is his first season with the University of Tennessee after a transfer from Illinois.
He took part in five totals before he left the game, bringing his total to 18.
Foreign buyers will charge higher stamps tax when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will charge higher stamp taxes when buying property in the UK and the additional income will be used to help homeless people, according to the new conservative plan.
The move will reduce Corbyn’s success in attracting new voters
The stamps tax savings will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects the tax to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher tax rate of stamps when buying property in the UK - the extra income will be used to help the homeless, declaring Teresa May today.
The move seems to be an attempt to reverse Jeremy Corbyn’s move to attract young voters, promising to provide cheaper housing and focus on high income owners.
The stamp tax will be imposed on people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional revenue will strengthen the government's move to help those who are old under difficult conditions.
The payment, which comes as an additional to the current stamp tax, including higher tax levels on secondary accommodation and real estate investments for rent, may reach a 3 percent high.
The Treasury expects the move to raise up to £120 million a year.
According to the estimate, 13 percent of the new properties built in London are acquired by foreign residents, a situation that causes price increases and makes it difficult for people who first buy property to set foot on the housing scale.
Many rich areas in the country -- and especially in the capital -- have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut in the stamps to help young people buy a first house.
He accused large companies of expensive property prices because they are hijacking land but do not use them, and he rushed to Ms. May to abandon the coverage of homes at a reasonable price and to fix Britain’s “distortment of housing.”
Corbyn announced a series of proposed attractive housing reforms, including supervision of the rent and cessation of “without charge” evacuations.
He also wants to give the Council greater power to build new homes.
May said: “I said last year that I would devote my term to the restoration of the British dream, which meant that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based in foreign countries, will be able to purchase homes with the same ease as working British residents.
The dream of becoming homeowners has become too far for too many people, and the humiliation of sleeping in difficult conditions is too realistic.
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland.
Sanderland Director Jack Ross said his \"optimistic ambition\" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scots is pleased with the North East Club's survival challenge, currently in third place in the first league, three points ahead of the ranking.
He moved to the summer light stadium after leading St. Miren back to first place in Scotland last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I once participated in an international game - Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportsound program.
But when I grew up, I watched the Scotland team playing a lot with my dad as a kid, and it was always something that pulled me back.
In any case, this opportunity will only come if I can manage the team.
Sanderland's former managers include Dick Edbukt, David Moiz, Sam Alradis, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keen, Gus Foyeh, and Paulo di Canio.
The former director of Aloa Athletic says that he was not afraid to come after such well-founded names at such a large club, having previously been rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success will now be achieved according to “Can I return the club to Premier League?”
Because of the structure and facilities in this club, no doubt it belongs to Premier League - he said.
\"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I can see myself as a success story here only if I can get the club back there.\"
Ross began his management career only three years ago, after a time as assistant manager in Damberton and 15 months as team coach of Hearts.
At the next stage, he helped Alawa out of League III and raised St. Miren from the deadline to her position as a championship winner in the following season.
Bruce says he feels more comfortable than ever during his game career at Clade, Hertolpole, Pulkirk, St. Miren and Hamilton Academy.
“It was probably a real noun,” he recalled, regarding taking command of God.
“I really believed that the management position was more suitable for me than the game.
It sounds weird because I played okay, I've earned a good deal, and I enjoyed some reasonable records.
But the career of an actor can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to deal with every week.
I'm still dealing with you in everything about stress and stress at work, but management just feels right.
I always wanted to run and now I'm doing it, and I've never felt more comfortable with myself as an adult.
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound, Sunday, September 30, on the Scottish Radio between 12:00 and 13:00, according to the British Summer Watch.
The perfect time for pint beer is at 17:30 on Saturday, in a survey.
The summer heat wave increased the profits of British pubs struggling for their existence, but caused pressure on restaurant networks.
Groups of pubs and bars enjoyed an increase in sales by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business consulting company, who gathered the data, said: “The meaning of the bright weather continuation and the long-term participation of England in the World Championship is that July was a pattern similar to June, with pub revenues rising by 2.8 percent, but restaurants suffered even harder.
The decline of 1.8 percent in trade in restaurants seen in June only increased in July.
Pubs and bars focused on drinks recorded the strongest performance, with higher growth than the decrease in income in the restaurant business, compared to the previous period.
Food-focused pubs also suffered from the sun, although they were less dramatic than restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out and drink something.
Among pubs and bars, the percentage of drinking sales increased by 6.6% over the month, and food sales fell by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, an RSM data analysis company in the field of leisure and hospitality, said: \"These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of sports events or important social events are the most important factors in relation to the out-of-house shopping market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle, although a fall of 4.8 percent in sales compared to last year would be particularly painful in addition to all the fixed costs.
The long and hot summer couldn't have reached a worse moment for businesses focusing on food, and time would tell if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August would bring about a decline of what they need.
The total growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, stood at 2.7 percent in July, and the slow reflection of brand launch.
The sales control agent for the Pubs, Bars and Restaurants UK, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 groups, with an integrated business cycle of over 9 billion pounds, and is the performance comparison index set in the sector.
One in five children have social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
A survey revealed that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed growth on fake Insta pages.
News has raised concerns about the advertising of sexual content
20% of students say they have a “head” account they show to parents
One in five children, some only 11 years old, creates social media accounts he keeps secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed rapid growth in fake Insta accounts as a reminder of the sharing site, Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they run a clean “head” account to show their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A 13-year-old mother who came across the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found that she was asking others \"to rape me\"
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the School Managers Association (HMC) of the UK's independent schools, found 40% of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles and half of them admit that they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Boknan said, “It’s disturbing that so many young people are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Ilid Doyle will be used as \"voice for athletes\" in the Scottish Athlete Directory
Ilide Doyle was elected to the Scottish elite board as an external director at the annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the easiest athlete and Chairman Ian Betti has described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who guide the sports industries to benefit from its rich international experience over the last decade.
“Ilide has gained great respect among the Scottish, British and global elites and we are sure that the Scottish athletes will make great use of bringing her to the board,” Bitty said.
“I am excited to be a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help with the sport in Scotland.”
The U.S., which won 200 and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, and in four Olympic gold medals in total, and has now been used regularly as a BBC retired man on the Internet, lost his ability to walk after suffering from a passing stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered from a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said it was only time to say whether good or how much.
It was a fruitful work, but I completely recovered, I re-learned how to go and now perform quick and responsive exercises!
Thank you for your encouragement!”
Advertising ads for milk pumps comparing mothers to cows from a party on-line
A milk pump company has distributed views online with an ad that compares healthy mothers to cow milk.
To point out the launch of the pump that is intended to be the “silent and undressed milk pump in the world” the private user technology company Elvie has published a humorous video ad to demonstrate the freedom of action the new pump gives mothers.
Four true mothers dance in a cow-sucked barn for the sounds of a song that includes words such as: “Yes, I’m drinking myself, but you can’t see a tail” and “in case you didn’t notice it’s not my breasts, it’s my breasts.”
\"A pump, a pump, I'm feeding the babies, a pump, a pump, a pump, I'm drinking my girls.\"
But the ad, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of responses, the video received mixed responses from the viewers, and many said it shed light on the \"wrong\" of the dairy industry.
“The decision is very bad to use fruits to publish the product.
Like us, they also need to get pregnant and have a baby to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them within a few days after the recommendation.
Elvie's milk pump combines discretion within the cleaning bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another response said, “Traditionally to the cow and circle as one.
But hey, why not use them to publish a milk pump for mothers who are entitled to keep their babies.
Another reaction said: “A completely detached ad”
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was \"a funny joke.\"
I think it's a genius idea.
I'd buy one if I was still cleaning up.
It made me feel just like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I've treated her content.
This is a great product: someone wrote.
Another reaction said: \"It's a funny ad designed for mothers who are keen (often in their workplaces or in the bathroom) and feel like \"frag.\"
It's not an awareness that you're cheating or judging the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women's group discovers that they're all dancing with the discreet pumps inside their fronts.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women, who use a milk pump, say they feel like cows.
But Elvie's pump is completely quiet, without tubes and wires, it is systematically integrated into the cleaning front and gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out during the pump.
Anna Blarin, a partner and head of early development department at Mother’s Hospital, said: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it has received a bold and proactive launch.
In creating the comparison between women who express themselves and dairy cows, we wanted to place the milk pump and all the challenges it has in the light of the lamps, and to demonstrate in a bright way, which can be identified, the amazing sense of freedom that the new pump will give.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s pump makes headlines.
During London Fashion Week, two children walked on the track for designer Martha Jacobowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly transferred to a tent camp at the Texas border
The number of migrant children in detention has jumped although the number of half of the monthly border remains relatively unchanged, and one reason is that the Trump administration’s conversation and policy have made it difficult to transfer children to sponsor.
Usually, most sponsors were undocumented immigrants, and feared that they could stay in the country in submitting applications for a child's liability.
The risk is a man in June, when federal authorities have announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members will have to hand over fingerprints, and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Authority, testified to Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied for custody of minors without supervision.
The Authority subsequently approved 70 percent of the detainees who had not been criminal.
Nearly 80 percent of sponsors or their home members are illegally in the country, and most of them are criminals from foreign countries.
That’s why we continue to pursue these people, Mr. Albans said.
In order to deal with solutions for children more quickly, officials introduced new laws that would require some of them to appear before a court within a month of their arrest, instead of 60 days as accepted under previous regulations, shelter workers reported.
Many will appear through a video conference call, instead of a face-to-face, to present their arguments for a legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for release will be expelled quickly.
The longer these children will remain sponsored, the more likely they will develop anxiety and depression, and this may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, the shelter workers said and reported that they have been published from the system in recent months.
Counsels say that these concerns increase in larger facilities like Tornalo, where it is likely that signs of the child's difficulties will be dropped due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the city of tents without providing a sufficient period of time to prepare them emotionally or separate from friends may make it worse for the trauma many are already facing.
Syria says U.S., French and Turkish forces withdraw immediately
The U.N. Secretary of State, Walid Al-Muslim, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
He disappeared, also serving as Deputy Prime Minister, saying that foreign forces are on Syria's land illegally, under the excuse that they are fighting terrorism, and \"to be treated accordingly.\"
“They must withdraw too much and unconditionally,” he said.
The war on terrorism almost ended in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to \"fight this holy battle until we clear the Syrian lands\" from terrorist organizations and any illegal foreign presence that it is - as one.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advice to Kurdish and Syrian forces who oppose the President of Israel.
France has more than 1,000 fighters on the country's territory.
As far as the refugee issue is concerned, it is ignored that the conditions for their return are good and that \"certain Western countries\" are accused of \"dispersing unreasonable fears\" that prompted refugees to stay away.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them return,” he said.
They're making politics a matter that's meant to be humanitarian only.
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid will not be sent to the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition in order to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish an Idleev-the last major rebel hold created an opportunity to advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with Russian support on the province, where three million people live.
However, it was ignored that the agreement was \"clear completion dates\" and expressed the hope that military action would focus on jihad fighters, including fighters from the coalition of victory linked to al-Qaeda, which would be destroyed.
UN envoy Stefan de Messorra hopes to convene early meetings of a new committee, composed of government members and opposition, to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Disappeared set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the work of the panel should be limited \"to examining the terms of the current constitution\" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win second term
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers hope, the rejection and scandal will end his presidency before her time.
While there is no doubt that \"the most dramatic ending in the history of the president\" of all times!
As of now, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the percentage of watching at peak times has increased by more than twice, reaching 1.05 million CNN viewers and almost tripled to 1.6 million MSNBC viewers.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in peak hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC show, reached the top rating of the cable with up to 3.5 million viewers in important news evenings.
“This is the fire that people are attracted to because it’s not something we understand,” said Neil Bar, the actual producer of the ABC drama series, “the intended survival” that deals with the Secretary of State who becomes president after an attack destroys the capital.
Lanelle Scobel, an old comedian writer and writer, \"Only the funny parts: ...and some hard facts about begging into the Hollywood Men's Circle have a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was voting for Trump.
She's a question.
\"He said, 'Because he's funny me',\" Mrs. Scobel told me.
The chaos has its own value.
Of course, unlike all other TV shows, the plotlines coming out of Washington could determine the future of the “Roo vs. Weed” ruling if migrant families could unite again and the health of the world’s economy.
Changing a channel or ignoring is a luxury that only most dedicated viewers can afford.
However, you're moving away from the boundaries of being educated citizens when you've been watching for six hours in a panel of Danish experts using Bob Woodward's \"Friendly Notice\" as a source of \"Fear\" to tell the Bumper's leather jacket of $15,000 worth of Paul Menafport ('a full-fledged clothing') and the consequences of the terrible descriptions of Stormi Daniels on, and sorry for the expression, Trump's anatomy.
I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
“Part of what he does, which gives a similar feeling to that of a reality program, is that he feeds you with something every evening,” said Bert Montagomori, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creates a “history for sale” program about Trump’s replacement team and the day-to-day turnouts (the war with the NFL, praises Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to lose one episode or stay behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Place this week, it was bright outside with a temperature of about 26 degrees on the north coast of the island of Kawii, but it closed to watch MSNBC, and recorded the CNN at the same time.
He couldn't break up, not when Robert Kwano was prepared to stand before the Senate's legal committee and the future of the Supreme Court depends on the balance sheet.
“I remember the times we’ve done all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Mr. Place told me.
I thought it was a joke, but apparently they were right.

Money from external sources awaits the race for the most close mid-century election Congress
It is no surprise that the 17th province of Pennsylvania faces a flood of funds, thanks to the reorganization of Congressional provinces, which led to the race of two members of Congress on the same seat.
The province, according to the newly re-opened state of Pittsburgh, has placed Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another province, in a special election last spring.
Lamp ran against another Congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th province of Pennsylvania, which largely coincided with the borders of the new 17th district.
The maps were retracted after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the division of the previous provinces had abused, and contrary to the Constitution, the results for Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a battle from financial riots in the campaign between the financial weapons of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamp became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March special election, which was widely viewed, for the 18th Congressional district in Pennsylvania.
The seat belonged to Republicans for more than a decade, and President Trump won a 20-point difference in the county.
Political commentators have seen an easy advantage for Democrats.
The U.S. has considered punishing El Salvador for support in China, and was subsequently withdrawn.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with mild resistance from Washington.
Trump held a warm meeting with Panama’s President, Juan Carlos and Arle, in June 2017 and held the hotel in Panama until his partners expelled Trump’s management team.
Foreign Ministry officials decided to return the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in response to the recent decisions that do not recognize any longer in Taiwan,” said H. Nwart, spokesman for the office, in a statement at the beginning of the month.
But the imposition of sanctions was considered only against Salvador, which was estimated to be $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in economic aid and restrictions on entry visas, could have hurt a Central American country with high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials rejected an urgent conference that should have focused on safety and economic prosperity as a continuation of a similar conference last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from reaching the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials made clear their desire to promote the conference, ending all the punishments against Salvador.
Vice President Mike Fence is now supposed to turn to the conference participants, who are currently scheduled for mid-October, as a symbol of the importance that the government attaches to him, the diplomats have said.
And three U.S. envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new messages or severe punishments from Washington.
The White House spokeswoman for Bolton refused to respond to the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss the internal discussions, provided that they remained anonymous.
Their explanations were confirmed by an external analyst, close to the government, who also spoke anonymously there.
Learn History
The next obvious thing may come from the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the disruption of Trump's alleged investigation proceedings, whose backs now have significant evidence in public records.
Mueller is referring his investigation, according to reports, to the question of whether Trump's campaign has cooperated with Russia in its attacks on our electoral system.
If Congress controls change, Trump will find himself accountable to this body, just as he prepares to stand before the voters again, and perhaps even to a jury.
There are a lot of questions here that start with \"if\" and I do not intend to argue that Trump's fall is inevitable - not even of the same roleholders in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were willing to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to prevent the death years that occurred as a result.
History's move revolves around such turning points, and the pursuit of democracy that cannot be halted, accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What would we do if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he had proposed to secretly record the president and made assumptions about his presidential misadvantage.
Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the F.B.I investigation into the recently requested case of Bert Quano is not complete or fair - or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is approved despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false committees?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of the U.S. and appoint Congress that Trump should be responsible?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will go into a long winter sleep.
But I believe we didn't fail, because of the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was expelled from Auschwitz by the Nazi regime who had previously occupied my magnificent home.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light Saturday candles on the same table bearing the cross of the crash.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Graham Dorans from Ringers Optimistic Towards the Rapid Vienna Conflict
The Ringers host Rafid Vienna on Thursday, and know that winning the Austrians, after the impressive anti-Varial version in Spain earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to be a G group in the European League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorans from showing up for the first time in the season until the 2-2 row with Viaryl, but he believes that the Ringers could use this result as a jumpboard for better performance.
“This was a good point for us because Viaryal is a good team,” the 31-year-old footballer said.
We came out of a belief that we could get something and we got a point.
We could have won at the end, but, in total, the case was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out of the caffeon in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope we can get three points but it'll be a tough game because they've achieved a good result in their last game, but with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can push and get a positive result.
Last year was really difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but there's a good feeling about the place now.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, put the last season behind and succeed.
Women remain awake because of this fear of pension savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of them, only a few people talk about it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide survey said they were talking to a couple about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to manage the conversation,” said Holly Schneider, Vice President of the National Security Company.
You can do this the next way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide treatment if you don’t express your wishes long before the date.
Help your advisor and family to discuss where and how to get treatment, as these choices may be a significant factor in determining cost.
Share your financial advisor: The advisor will also help you find a way to pay for expenses.
Your long-term care funding options may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a sum of money that will help cover expenses, or self-insurance with your capital - as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: Find an early solution to legal struggles at this opportunity.
Find and be a force for health care, a reliable person who will monitor your medical treatment and make sure that professionals meet your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also signing up for power as far as your money is concerned.
Choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions in your place and ensure that accounts are paid if you are not qualified.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your adult parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications or allergies?

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people found their death in a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo, said official sources, and the number of deaths is expected to rise.
The disaster caused the separation of media networks and official aid officials who were unable to receive information from Dongala County, a region in northern Palo, which was closer to the noise source of 7.5.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people were killed after the disaster hit.
Here are a few facts about Palo and Dongala, in the island of Salavousi:
Palo is the capital of the province of the \"Sulavosi Center\", located at the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Solomon Islands, with a population of 379,800 people in 2017, estimates.
The city indicated its 40th anniversary when the tsunami wave and the earthquake hit it.
Dongala is a district that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of the coast line in the northwestern Solomon Islands.
The population in the province, an administrative area within the province, was estimated to be 299,200 people in 2017.
The main sources of income in the province's economy are fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Another important source of income is nickel mining, mainly concentrated in Morvali, on the opposite side of Solavosi.
Palo and Dungala have been hit several times by waves of tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami wave killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in the country.
A tsunami wave also hit West Dungala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Ring area, known for its symmetry activity and is permanently damaged by earthquakes.
Here are some of the greatest tsunamis and earthquakes in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Acha, north of Somtra, on December 26, caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, and more than half of the dead were found in Bache.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Somtra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died in Nias Island, in front of Somtra Beach.
2006: A 6.8 earthquake hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, causing a tsunami that exploded on the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 hit the area near Fadang, the capital of the province, West Somtra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the Mantawai Islands, opposite Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A land-based earthquake hit the province of Fidi Jia Bacha, causing destruction and panic, as the people of the place were remembered for the post-earth disaster and the deadly tsunami wave in 2004.
The earthquake did not cause the tsunami in this case, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings destroyed.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombo, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily abandoned.

According to the network, he appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself “not guilty, for sure” when he was asked to flatter his claims.
Payne was charged with three type A behavior offences, and may, therefore, be imprisoned for a year and fined at $250,000.
He was also accused of a type B conduct offence, according to which a day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000 could be imposed.
It's not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Feline.
In December 2017, he was charged with his father's attack, Todd Pylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in court for Alaska's released soldiers.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, disrupting the reporting of a crime of domestic violence, and holding arms under drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her.
Groups of freed soldiers criticized Sarah Paylin in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his service in Iraq.
tsunami wave and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that hit Indonesia's Solomon Islands on Sunday.
The earthquake, with a strength of 7.5, caused a tsunami wave and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication networks have been cut off and the loss rate is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit close to the center of Salavousi, northeastern of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos, distributed on social media, present the moment of injury.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate the beach festival in Palo when the tsunami wave exploded on the beach.
Federal prosecutors are asking for a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
New York federal prosecutors are seeking death penalty for Sipolo Sipov, suspected of terror attack in New York City, who has killed eight people - a rare sentence that has not been put into effect for a federal crime in the country since 1953.
The 30-year-old Sipov used the claim of a rental truck by Hum Dippo to carry out a bike attack next to the West Side Highway in South Manhattan, and a pedestrian and bike driver who took their way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Sipub had deliberately killed the eight victims and \"initially\" caused serious injuries to the body, according to the statement of intent to request the death penalty, which was filed in the southern quarter of New York.
According to the court's document, a death penalty may be required for these two counts.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury member of Sipov with a 22-page indictment, including eight charges of murder with the help of extortion, usually used by the federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and the prosecution of violence and the destruction of preventable vehicles.
The attack called for \"a significant planning in advance and in the first place\" and described how Saipov carried out the attack as a \"damage, cruel and sick\"
Sipolo Habibolovich Sipov caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Eric Angelini, Nicolas Calves, An-Lor Dodd, Darn Drake, Ariel Arrige, Hernan Prochi, Hernne Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damein Panuko, written in the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the South Quarter of New York sued death in the case occurred a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Burns, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was put into effect in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who was executed after being convicted for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, expressed no regret in the days and months following the attack.
He told the researchers that he felt good about his actions, police said.
Sipov told authorities that he had inspired the attack after watching Daesh videos on his phone, according to the accusation.
According to the police, he also asked to hang Daesh's flag in the hospital room where he was staying.
He claimed to be innocent in response to the 22-year-old charger.
David Patton, one of the federal senators representing Saipov, said they were “disputed of course” of the prosecution’s decision.
“We think that the decision to seek death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt that leads to a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only date the duration of the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Paton said.
Sipov's senatory team once asked prosecutors not to require death penalty.
A Conservative Parliamentary Member says to be in charge of negotiating for Brexit
Miguel Prague ordered to recruit the People's Army today during a protest at the Conservative Conference.
The former leader of the UKIP said politicians must “seek pressure” from the Russians - when a member of the Conservative Party of the Trisa May's Conservative Party claimed he should be responsible for negotiating with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Boone said in a move in Birmingham that Britain was already \"outside\" at this point if Prague was acting as Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge faced by May, the very divided lines of conservatives, was highlighted by the accession of conservatives supporting the stay in the European Union for a different demonstration against the Brexit in the city.
The prime minister struggles to leave her settlement plan, the Chekers, on its way despite attacks by Brexit supporters, remaining supporters and the European Union.
The allies insisted that she would continue to try and reach an agreement with Brussels despite counter-reactions - and forced the Russians and the Labour Party to choose between her agreement and chaos and chaos.
Boone said at a meeting of the Leave Means Leave group in Soliha that he wanted to break up with Chras.
He claimed that Prague had to be accepted as a member and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we would be out at this point,” he said.
MP Wellingborough added: \"I'll defend the Brexit but we need to break up with Chras.\"
He stressed his opposition to the European Union and said: “We have not fought in two world wars to be slaves.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Boone dismissed the allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is completely false.”
The Conservative Parliamentary and Brexit supporter Andrea Ginkins was also on the move and told reporters: “I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chekres program is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular among our party and our activists who went out to the streets and chose us in the first place.
Please leave the chuckles and start listening.”
In a critical message directed at May, she added: “Prime ministers keep their job when they fulfill their promises.”
Prague said at the conference that there must be “a sense of pressure” if they are to betray a decision made at the People’s referendum in 2016.
“This is now about the question of trust between us, the people, and our political status,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We won’t let you get away with his spending.’”
He added: “I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray the Brexit, feel stressed.
“We call on the people’s army of this country, which has given us the victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent UK, self-government and proud.”
At that moment, the remaining supporters moved to Birmingham and then held a two-hour conference in the city centre.
An active handful of “conservatives against Brexit” attacks after the group was established this weekend.
Labour member Lord Syds cook at the opening of the Conservatives Conference on the security issues he suffered with the party's app.
“It’s about people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology that is possible to make an agreement like Canada plus plus, to cross a border without frictions and free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
\"It's totally ridiculous.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to \"consider seriously\" a presidential run.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will \"seriously consider running for president\" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic Senator from Massachusetts expressed his opinion about his future during a city meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who often visits President Donald Trump, faces the November presidential election against Republican Jeff Deal, who served as co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She stood at the center of rumors that you might face Trump in 2020.
The event in Hollywood, which took place on Saturday afternoon, is the 36th meeting with voters in a meeting format in the city building since Trump took office.
One of the present asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government and make a woman head.
In the event of the shooting of Sims from LSU
Police in the capital of Louisiana, Baton Rose, announced on Saturday that the suspect in a shooting that killed the basketball player from the LSU group, Weed Sims, was arrested on Sunday.
The Boston Rose Police announced the arrest of the 20-year-old Dayton Simpson during a press conference at 11 a.m.
Police released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a person who appeared in the photographs.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the University of SouthRen campus early on Sunday.
“Wed Sims suffered a shot wound in his head and eventually died of it,” said police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday, as reported by 247sports.
Wood tried to protect a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was investigated and admitted to having a gun and singing at Lloyd Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at the East County Police Department of Baton Rose.
He played 32 games with 10 games starting last season and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Fruit Russia: Louis Hamilton finishes with a world degree after team graduates have given him a victory over Sebastian Watt
It was clear, from the moment Walter Botas took the next step before Louis Hamilton on Saturday, that Mercedes team graduates would play an important role in the race.
From the first moment, Botas had a good start and he left Hamilton almost alone defending his place in the first two rounds and invited Watt to attack his team member.
Watel first went out to stop the middle and let Hamilton fit in with the competition's tail movement, probably a decisive decision.
The Mercedes team went out to stop the middle of a later round and returned to the race behind Watt, but Hamilton moved forward after a tight wheel struggle that eventually the Ferrari driver was forced to leave the inner track to hold a risk-free position after a double move in the third corner.
Max Verstappan, who celebrated his 21st birthday, began from the back line of the ranking and was seventh on the end of the first round.
He then led over a large part of the race and did not replace tires to get a quick finish and bypass Kimmy Reykonna to fourth place.
He eventually fell into a middle stop in the 44th round and was unable to increase the rate in the remaining eight rounds when Rikonen took fourth place.
It's a hard day because Walter did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me get around him.
The team did an extraordinary job to get to Hubble, Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump was impressed by Senator Diane Feinstein at the conference on Saturday, in connection with her assertion that he had not leaked a letter from Christine Blaise Ford, who accused Bert Cavano of being a candidate for the Supreme Court of sexual assault.
When speaking at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the evidence given by Ford to the Senate’s legal committee, and instead said that the Senate would show that people are “bad and disgusting and liars.”
“The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry and wicked and disgusting and liars,” he said.
When you look at publications and leaks, then they say, \"Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... Have you leaked the document-- \"Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.
So, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak-- he added in a Senator's play.
Feinstein received a letter detailing the charges against Quano in July, and he was leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
\"She asked me to keep his secret and I kept the secret of the letter as she asked me.\"
But it doesn't seem that the Senator's denial was accepted by the president, who responded to her during the conference on Saturday night: \"I'm telling you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe it's not [the leak], but it's the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, and claimed that the Democrats were using the charges for their purposes.
“They are determined to return to power at all costs.
You see the evils, the vain ones, they don't care who they hurt, who they are on the way to power and power, the president said, according to a mediaite report.
Top League: Dandy Stars with a 5-3 result against the giants of Balfest
Patrick Duyer conquered two waves in favor of the giants against Dandy
Dandy's stars have made up their losses in the top league on Saturday against giants in the Bleptet and won the next 5-3 game, Dandy on Saturday.
The giants had an early advantage of two waves that were scored by Patrick Doyer and Francis at Willier.
Mike Sliven and Jordan Cooney returned their group to affairs until Sawyer returned the advantage to the giants.
Francois was the same for the Danes until two waves of Lucas to Andwald Nilsen promised victory.
This is the third loss in the season in a senior league for Man Kiff's group, who came back to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Balfest, on Sunday 6.
This is the fourth meeting during the season between the two teams, and the giants won the previous three games.
The first chicken came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Candle McFawl's cooking, and David Rothford cooked the chicken of Willier when he doubled the result four minutes later.
In the first quarter full of activity, Sliven returned the home team to the game at 13:10 until Matt Markward cooked Cony's equal skull at 15:16.
Dweyer promised the advantage of the giants when he took out the first break when he scored his second skull in the evening at the end of the first Tuesday.
The house team was re-opened and the remaining scored again, comparing the game of forces at 27:37.
Kaoney and Charles Corcoren combined forces to help Nilsen give an advantage to Danes for the first time in the game, at the end of the second trimester, and Nielsen promised the victory of the Danes with the fifth Golan, which scored from half the field in the last quarter.
The giants, who lost four out of their last five games, will face their homeground against Milton Keyns in the next game on Sunday.
An air inspector who sacrificed his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on the plane could escape an earthquake.
An airline officer in Indonesia was designated as a hero after he sacrificed his life to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers would safely take off.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a strong earthquake hit the island of Salavosi on a day of 6 and caused a tsunami wave.
Strong secondary shocks continue to harm the region and many people are trapped in the destruction of the city of Palo.
But despite many of his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, Anthonius Genwan Agong, 21, refused to abandon his position, in a strong-torn oversight tower at Muteira airport Sisi al-Jupri in Palo.
He's staying in place to ensure that Batik Air's 6321 flight can safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was crashing.
He died in the hospital later.
Air spokeswoman Navigisen Indonesia, Johannes Sirite, said his decision might have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter from the airport in Alyquan, Clinton, to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palo.
“Our heart is broken to hear the news,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death penalty may reach thousands because the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Relief, access to Senegal, Sigi and Botong are limited.
“As explained, the death toll will continue to rise because many bodies are still buried under destruction and access to many others is not possible,” said agency spokesman Satopo Forva.
Waves up to six feet high destroyed Palo and the city was buried on Sunday.”
Military and commercial aircraft bring assistance and equipment.
A 35-year-old lady, Lisa Cosmos, told Sky News: “Ambition brings bodies every minute.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-market stores are everywhere.
Jan Galpand, head of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross works quickly to help survivors but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is now a tragedy, but it can get worse.
President of Indonesia Joko and his isolation came to Palo on Sunday and told the state soldiers: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready - CNN reported?
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Bloombow, where more than 550 people were killed.
Air New Guinea says one person is missing after crashing a plane in Laguna
The airline, which operated the flight that took place in the Pacific Legonna in Micronesia, now says that one person was missing, having previously declared that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the plane.
Air New Guinea said in a statement that began from the afternoon on Saturday, it was not possible to say what happened to one passenger's fate.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try and find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
Local boats helped save passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport of Chuck Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that all remaining remained stable.
The reason for the crash and the movement of the exact events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in Laguna a short distance from the route.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had missed the track.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes said the plane was on a very low track.
“This is a very positive thing,” said Janes.
Janes said he and the others were able to take their way to the emergency exits at the height of the waist on the plane.
He said the plane crew was pressed and screamed, and he suffered a slight blow in his head.
The U.S. Navy said that salters who worked near the site to improve salt also helped in rescue operations, using an inflated boat that brought people to the beach before the plane was in the water of about 30 meters (100 feet).
Air Safety Network (ASN) data say 111 people have been killed in crashes by newly registered airlines in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air New Guinea has not been involved in any of these incidents.
Analyst details the events on the night when a woman is burned alive
The prosecution proved his argument on Saturday, in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi while she was alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roulette of the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert in intelligence surgery.
He explained to the jury how he used mobile phone records to connect the defendant's movements, 29-year-old Quinton Thalis, and the victim's movements, Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old night she was murdered.
According to the Calculator report, Roulette said he received the location data from several mobile phones that showed Telis was with Chamber on the night he died, hiding his previous claims.
When the data showed his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sandford, the police went out to talk to Sandford.
Sanford went on the stand of witnesses and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was a real thing when he said he was with Sanford that night, Sandford said he was \"a lie, because my truck was in Nashville.\"
Another contradiction was that Tellis said she knew Chamber two weeks before she died.
The cell phone records showed that they only knew each other a week.
Roulette said that some time after Chamber's death, Thalis deleted the text messages, calls, and contact details of Chambers from his phone.
“He removed her from his life,” Hill said.
The defense will begin with its summary speech on Sunday, according to planning.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury at a later stage that day.

Another black man?
A New York therapist sues a couple for dismissal after a “racial” text message
A New York therapist sues a couple for distancing because of discrimination after receiving a text message that was not intended for her from whether she complained that the therapist was another black person.
The couple denied that he was racist and compared the lawsuit to \"scrambling\"
Lancy Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she discovered that her new baby care provider, Jaisal Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa another black man” wrote Ms. Falsco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent her back to Morris twice.
According to a report by the New York Post, after noting the emissary, Falksman fired Ms. Morris, saying that the former African-American therapist had done a bad job, and that she was now expecting to hire a Philippinesman in his place.
Mrs. Morris got paid for one working day and was sent to her home with Uber.
Now, Morris sues the couple for dismissal, and seeks compensation of $350 a day for six months of work and accommodation where they were originally rented, though without a contract.
“I want to show them, look, don’t do such things,” she said to Post on a day-to-day and added, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple returned to war for claims that they were racists, saying that Morris' end would be requested, out of fear they could not trust her after they hurt her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racists - her husband, Joel Falsco, told the post.
But did your child's job in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was wrong?
Are you your soft baby?
Come on.
Falsco compared the lawsuit to \"scrambling\" and said his wife was supposed to be born only two months before the event and was \"in a very difficult situation\"
Do you want to chase someone like her?
It’s not nice to do something like that, adding the investment bankers.
The legal case is still in process, but the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, and undermined their behavior and the arguments they used.
A new letter reveals that Pedington's publishers feared that readers would not be identified with a talking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Ginkel, born shortly after the book was received, said about the letter: \"It's hard to imagine yourself in the place of someone reading the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to know now what we know about Pedington's enormous success.
After she said that her father, who worked at the BBC as a photographer before inspired to write the children's book from a small toy bear, would have become a blood hunger for his work, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was \"Merir Sweet\" after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of Fedington's success, which she described as a \"very important friend in our family\"
“He was a quiet man, not a arrogant man,” she said.
But because Pedington was so true for him, it was almost as if you had a child that got something: you're proud of him even though it's not really due to you.
I think he saw Pedington's success like that.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always said it was due to Pedington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was transferred to Louis Paster 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to vainly save her life.
Ned called regularly and said that her condition was really bad, which you are not expected to hold up - Mrs. Adnan-Laprous said.
And then I got a mand call in which he said she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave to her so that she would continue to beat out slowly and get out of her system.
She died sometime before, and it's over, it's all over.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing that it was all happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people right now.
I really had to hold on.
In the end, Mrs. Adnan-Laprous, now in mourning for the loss of her daughter, went on a plane alongside other passengers, who were unaware of the trip of the last siege.
No one knew - she said.
My head was improvised, and tears were running all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had a sense of incredible recognition with Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women Swimming Outs on a Bridge to Prevent Suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Pizza hung out on a bridge in Walsh with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people could call to get support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any other parent to feel like I feel every day - she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Bladeney, said that her son was a promising chef with a smile.
Everyone recognized him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile lighted every room.
But he stopped working before his death, because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis said, \"I'm afraid without stopping chain reaction.
Mrs. Davis created the discoveries, so that people would know that there is someone to come and talk about, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence - you need to talk.
Mrs. Hempress, Mrs. Davis's girlfriend for years, lost Mark, a partner for life for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed or something else,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was down on Christmas Day, when the kids opened the gifts, he didn't make an eye contact or something like that.
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they've overcome it: \"It creates a hole in the family.
It tears us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting.

Burt Quano's future is at stake when the FBI begins his investigation.
“I thought, if we can really get what we’ve asked, a limited-time and limited-scale investigation, perhaps we can bring with it only to the Union,” Flick said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would “exploit” the victims at the end of the rooted party’s shutdown.
Why would the Republicans not want to investigate the FBI?
They are all drawn from timing.
The middle term election will take place only five more weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, Republicans will not succeed in it, they will be greatly weakened by their attempts to make the choice of the man they want to the highest court in Israel.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the Senators to trick them into supporting Kwano, who worked at the White House for Bush and met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI issues its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are present.
It is still unclear whether Quano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Fence to break the equality and approve his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserts in North Korea is \"Red\" under Kim.
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Byong-Sig Park, quoted data from the South Korean Union Office last year, saying that the number of deserts last year stood at 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the main elements of this were a more stringent border review between North Korea and China and more than the people's escapes.
Pyongyang did not make a public statement.
The vast majority of North Korean deserts eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, with which North Korea has the longest border and which is easier to cross compared to the military territory (DMZ) well maintained between two countries of Korea.
China treats deserters as illegal migrants and not as refugees, and often returns them for forced return.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still in the war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
The meeting took place after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where the two generally agreed to act towards an era where the Korean Peninsula would not hold nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ry Young-Ho blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress since.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and in such circumstances, there is no chance that we will permanently dismantle our weapons first,” Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Flossy calls Bert Cavano \"Histry\" and says it's not appropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader at the House of Representatives, Nancy Plusi, called on the Supreme Court candidate \"Histry\" and said his character did not allow him to serve in the Supreme Court.
Flosey responded in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn’t think that if a woman ever appeared like this, they would say “historical,” Plusy said about her response to Kawano’s testimony to the Senate’s legal committee on Thursday.
Kavano openly rejected the allegations that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavano was very emotional, and sometimes cried and suffocated when he spoke of his family and high school years.
He also defended Democrats on the committee and called for arguments against him for a \"coordinated character murder\" organized by the liberals' anger over Hillary Clinton's loss of presidential election in 2016.
Plusy said that Kavano's testimony proved unable to serve in the Supreme Court because it showed a prior opinion against the Democrats.
\"I think he's ousted himself with these statements and the way he pursued the clintons and the Democrats,\" she said.
Plusy hesitated to ask whether he would try to overthrow his country if his appointment was approved, and if the Democrats won the majority of the House of Representatives.
\"I say so -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI then he doesn't fit, not only to serve in the Supreme Court, but also to the court where he currently serves,\" said Plusi.
Kavano currently serves as a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals of Columbia.
Plusi added that, as a Democrat, she has concerns about possible Kavano judgments against Obama's health reform or the Rue v. Weed judgment, because he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavano avoided any questions about the possibility of cancelling certain Supreme Court decisions.
“There’s no reason for a hysteric and conscientious man to come to court and expect that it’s said, ‘It’s not great.’”
And women should use it.
It's a severe criticism, months and years of anger goes above his banks, and she can't express them without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinen told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s rare, is it?”
She continued, \"I got a lot of help from a woman who was running elsewhere, who said that she was crying when she got upset, but she developed a technique and every time she got upset and started crying, she used to tell the man she spoke to, \"You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry.
And then she just continued.
And I thought it was brilliant.
Tears get out of anger, among other things because they are not understood in essence.
One of my most significant memories of a career early in my life, in an office with a male majority, is that I once found myself crying with an inexorable anger, and an older woman caught my back, it was a career manager from whom I was always a little afraid - and dragged me to the stairs room.
“Don’t let them see that you’re ever crying” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re being angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they've been able to suppress you.
Patricia Sherder, who was at the same time a Congressional company from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Art caught a novel manager outside of a ship named Monkey Business and left the race, Sherder, who was deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she would not consider the idea of dealing with the president herself.
“It wasn’t a decision I thought of well,” she told me 30 years later and laughed.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another player.
Someone called it \"Six Snows and Seven Pumps\"
Since she joined the campaign at a later stage, she took advantage of the fundraising, so she swore she would not join the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She found out that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
“They think I get a discount,” she wondered.
When she announced that she would not open on a formal campaign, her feelings were so much expected of her - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration from the system that had been so difficult to raise funds and focus on voters instead of representatives, and anger over sexual discrimination - she suffocated tears.
“I could have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” she said.
“I could have thought I was sponsored by Kalinx.
I remember thinking, what would they write about my situation?
\"She was crying.\"
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening points of the U.S.-China trade war were two-thirds of ears, and although the battle is far from over, a break between countries could be useful to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, shot the opening shot earlier this year when he imposed a tax on important Chinese exports products, including solar, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs affecting products worth $ 200 billion (£150 million), actually imposing taxes on half of the goods imported to the United States from China.
Beijing responded at a time in the same currency, and recently raised prices by 5 to 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to bring back a blow to every U.S. blow, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will surrender in the near future.
A request from Washington to return to it means surrendering to its demands, but public coding to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for China’s president, Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing is able to manage properly, pressure from the U.S. trade war could positively support China in the long term, and reduce the mutual dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the beginning of economic turmoil in each country is actually much more dangerous than ever before,” said Avigil Grace, a research partner focused in Asia, in the New American Security think tank.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to return voluntarily to refugees and calls for assistance to rebuild a country destroyed in a long war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations Assembly, Secretary of State Walid Al-Muslim said the conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress achieved in the war on terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to bring the situation back to normal.
All conditions now exist for the return of refugees from their free will to the country they have left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures designed to harm their daily lives and livelihood.
More than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mosul said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance to rebuild the destroyed state.
But he stressed that the regime would not receive aid or aid from countries that funded the rebels.
Europe won the Reider Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Reider Cup and defeated the U.S. team with a final result of 16.5 - 10.5 on the Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.
The U.S. has so far lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Reyder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again won the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bourne's team reached 14.5 points she needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Michaelson, who fought for almost all of the tournament, sent his hit from T to the water in the 16th century of Far-3 and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golf player Molinary has been brilliant in all his circles, becoming one of the four players who have reached 5-0 since the beginning of the tournament in 1979.
American actor Jordan Spit was defeated 5 and 4 by the lowest-ranking player in the European team, The Warbourn Olsen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's first ranked player, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Fuller from England, which may be the last time he played the Ryder Cup.
With an eight-year-old man in the Reider Cup, the Spanish Sergeio Gercia became the European player with the highest number of tournament wins with 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t stand.
It was a hard year.
So I'm grateful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's a team, and I'm glad I could help,” says Grace with emotion after the European victory.
He is passing on the White Halpid to his country, John Ram, who defeated the American legend Tigger Woods 2 and 1 in the only game on Sunday.
“The great pride I feel, to defeat Tigger Woods, where I watched when I grew up,” said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France and his record now stands at 13-21-3, with the Ryder Cup in its career.
These are strange statistical data from one of the best players of all time, who won 14 important degrees, before which Jack Niclaus was only found.
The U.S. team fought throughout the weekend to find its way through the lawn, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Pinao, who played a high-level golf all over the tournament.
Captain Jim Fyric spoke after his team's disappointing performance, \"I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Good for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll reorganize, I'll work with the American Golf Association and our Reider Cup committee and we'll move on.
I like these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You need to take the hat off.

Update on Red Gaelic: The concentrations are reduced in Finelas, Manati and Sarsota
The latest report from Florida's Wildlife and Fish Commission shows a general decline in red Goat concentrations in part of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC Committee, more widespread flowering conditions have been reported in the provinces of Finelas, Manati, Sarsota, Charlotte and Collier, indicating reduced concentrations.
The rise of the Red Goats extends across about 130 miles from the coast, from the northern province of Finelas to the southern Li.
The sections can be found about 10 miles from the coast of Helsborough, but in a number of smaller locations compared to last week.
The red waves were also seen in the province of Pasco.
Medium concentrations on the coast or against the coast of the province of Finelas were reported last week, low to medium concentrations against the coast line of Helsboro County, background concentrations up to high concentrations in Manati County, background concentrations up to high concentrations on the coast or against the coast of Sarsuta County, background concentrations up to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background concentrations up to high concentrations on the coast or along the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in the Collier County.
Reports of stimuli in the respiratory system are drawn from the provinces of Finelas, Manati, Sarsota, Lee and Collier.
No stimuli have been reported in the Northwest Florida respiratory system over the past week.
