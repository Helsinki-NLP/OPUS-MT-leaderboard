AMs from Wales fear to be seen as a blow-up
There is a conspiracy among some AMs following a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Wales Parliament).
This was raised by plans to change the name of the Wales Parliament assembly.
The AMs around the political spectrum are worried that this will make them look radical .
AM Labour said that his group was concerned that it had the same sound as Twp and Pwp.
For outside readers Wales: In the language of Wales twp means Ibleh and pwp means rwt.
Plaid's AM said that the whole group was not happy and suggested alternatives.
Conservative from Wales said that his group had an open mind on name changes, but noted that there was a small verbal difference from MWP to Muppet.
In this context the letter w in Wales language is pronounced in a manner similar to the statement of the letter and.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce changes in the name, said: -The final decision on any description of what should be called the Members of the Assembly of course will be the matter of the members themselves -
The Act of the Government of Wales of 2017 empowered the Wales assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that had broad support for the assembly called a Wales Parliament.
On the issue of the title of AMs, the Commission favoured members of the Wales Parliament or WMPs, but MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
Apparently, AMs are suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching a consensus can be a headache for the co-chairing officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes in the way the assembly works, including rules on the qualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on the question of how to be called when they have a debate on legislation.
In Macedonia it is left to the public opinion in a referendum on the change in name of country
Votes will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country name for the Republic of Northern Macedonia
The popular vote was established with a view to finding a solution to a dispute that lasted decades with the neighbouring country Greece, which has its own province, Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents .
President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the change in name, said that he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in name is simply the consequence of entry into the EU and NATO.
St.Martin's Necklaces Stop Playing as Churches in Harlem Send
- Historically, the elders I spoke to say there was a bar and a church in every corner,” said Mr Adams.
-Today, there is no
He said he could understand how the bars disappeared.
He said, -People socialise differently - today.
The bars are no longer the centre of locality activity where people go on a regular basis.
As regards churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders are thinking, - and today or tomorrow they will end where they were at first -
It added that churches can be replaced by apartment blocks with condoms of the kind that will not help the rest of the church.
The vast majority of people who buy condoms in this building will be a white caravan, - he said, -and so, they will not bother when they arrive the day they are thrown into these churches because most of these people who enter these condoms will not become members of these churches.
The two churches were built by white-cargo communities before Harlem became a Metropolitan Community Metropolitan Metropolitan in 1870, St.Martin's ten years later.
The original White Cargo Congregation left in the 1930s.
A congregation of black Carnival people practicing close religion took the title to the building.
St. Martin's was taken from a community of black freighters under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a retailer's bowl in 125 Street, a major shopping road in Harlem, which has been resistant to renting or promoting black freighters.
Fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishes made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillo.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson's and successor of St. Martin's, was proud when he called the carylon - the bees of the people -
The expert who played the carillon in July will take some other action: -Cultural treasure - and a unique historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that she was the first carillo in the world to have a black-carrillon musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the older carillo in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriwether said that St. Martin's did not change with anyone else.
What has happened in St. Martin's over the last few months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the leaders of the lay church, others from the Episodes.
The vestry - the parish's government body, composed of lay leaders - wrote the diocesis in July with concerns that the diocesi - will seek to pass the costs - to the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in attracting the architects and contractors who suffered from the diocesis.
Some parishes complained about a lack of transparency on the side of the diocesis.
The dog hurts a 13-year-old child during a horse's watch in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was playing for the horse in California on the day of the opening of the horse's season, officials said.
The attack took place shortly before the 7th morning in which Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was playing with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child cry for help and then went to a group to help draw out of the water.
Hammel said that he thought at first that it was the following excitement to catch a walnut, but then - realize that he was crying, 'Gid me!
Gidimni!’
Killed and opened the whole club, - Hammel said he realized the moment when the boy arrived.
“There’s a dog in the water!” said Hammel.
Take the child by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The species of the dog responsible for the attack has not been known.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said in a meeting with the media that a dog was caught in the area a few weeks earlier, but was determined not to be a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic wounds in the upper part of the torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Salesbury's plans enter the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with shelf corridors similar to those of a \"department store\" of beauty products equipped with specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial revenue on the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while selling clothes and household goods is falling, the larger corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 shops across the country and the idea will be spread to more shops next year if it is successful.
Investing in beauty came after supermarkets were looking for ways to use the space on shelves that was once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's said it will double the amount of beauty goods that it offers up to 3000 items, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have more space with brand areas similar to those in shops like Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are suitable for vegans - something that is increasingly called for by smaller buyers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop's retailer will examine concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first one opening in Croydon, London down last week, while the second opened in Sely Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means that supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to buy from there.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that shops will increasingly look like a \"department stores\" as the chain of supermarkets tries to fight against shops that discount Aldi and Lidl prices with more services and non-food products.
In addition, the Commission notes that, in the light of the above, Argos's market share is not the same as that of the market economy operator.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments has failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the link ended after a fight on how to split the income from pharmacist stores into its supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's selling the pharmacy business with 281 shops to Celsio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million, three years ago.
He said that Lloyds will play a role in the plan, adding an extended range of luxury skin care firms including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's business director, said: -We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to be appropriate for each need and your attractive environment and convenient shopping positions mean we have become a destination of beauty products of interest that challenges the old way of buying.
Peter Jones' 'very intense' after Holly Willoughby cancels an agreement of £11 million
Dragons' personality Den Peter Jones' 'very angry' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled an agreement of £11 million with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for the home product brand and their accessories, True.
The company was compared with the company of Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop.
This Morning presenter, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce that he will leave.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' personality - Den Peter Jones very angry because she cancelled being part of their money-making lifestyle brand business in the last minute - to focus on her big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was very angry when the very popular television personality admitted at a tense meeting on Tuesday at his enrome business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, whose new agreements - with a value of up to £1.5 million - ended up missing enough time to dedicate it to their brand of household products and accessories, Truly.
The business was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow Goop's firm and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce that she would leave with Truly, Jones left Britain and went to one of his private explorers.
Source said: -Truly was with Holly's first priority.
It would have been her long-term future that would have filled her with the next few decades.
Her decision to leave left everyone completely surprised.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch almost arrived.
There is a full store produced at Marlow headquarters ready for sale -
The experts believe that the departure of this Morning presenter, located among the profitable British figures, could mean a cost of millions for the company due to a large investment in products from wood and candles to clothes and household products, and the potential for further delays until its launch.
And may mean a long friendship ending.
Mother of three children, Willoughby and her village Dan Baldwin have been well friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, with them as chairman in March.
The couple ride together and Jones has a 40 per cent share in Baldwin television production company.
Willoughby shall become an ambascator of the M&S firm and will replace Ant McPartlin as I'm A Celebrity of ITV.
Yesterday evening, a close source of Jones said: “We don’t comment on his economic affairs.”
A difficult meeting 'but then we found love'
It was a criticism of the news media for making a comment that some people considered - not presidential - and for being so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with a voice to imitate that of a news presentationer
-I didn't give up anything -
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump announced that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards denuclearisation of North Korea.
But denuclearisation negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Young Ho, told world leaders, on Saturday, at the General Assembly, that North Korea did not see a corresponding response from the United States to the early steps of North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, note that the US continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech.
He said, -We're walking well with North Korea -
-We were going to enter war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have this very good relationship -
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - the end of rocket tests, aid in the release of hostages and the return of U.S. veterinarians who had stayed home.
And he defended his unusual approach while talking about relations with Kim.
-It is very easy to be presidential, but instead of getting 10,000 people outside trying to enter this arena filled with people, we had about 200 people standing there, - Trump said, he and standing at the crowd right in front of him.
Sunami and Terremot in Indonesia Destroy Island, Killing Hundreds of People
In the consequences of the Lombrok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not required.
Even after more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombrok had to move from their home, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalysing international aid.
-Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, thus challenging, - said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organising a team to travel to Palu, it is unclear whether foreign staff can operate on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, the speaker of the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Taking into account the earthquakes occurring in Indonesia, the country is still not well prepared for the great anger of nature.
While sheltering from tsunamis was built in Aceh, they are not seen on the coast.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although he issued a warning, likely contributed to the loss of life.
In the best times, travel between the numerous islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship was posted in Lombok for the care of the victims on his way to Palu, but it will last at least three days to arrive on the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made improvements in the infrastructure falling into pieces of Indonesia, the centre of his electoral campaign, and spent a lot of money on roads and trains.
But Mr. Joko's administration has been sent due to the lack of funds as he faces his re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from sectoral tensions still in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of this faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to move from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the road, using ‘machetes’, bows and arrows and other types of weapons.

I saw Kante coming on me and touched the ball once and I didn't think about it much and tried to shoot the ball.
Chelsea were winning 1-0 to half the game after bringing 'goal' in 25 minutes from very good Belgian player Eden Hazard.

The Statute of the Cromwell Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the argument on ‘rewrite history’
Its removal would be a form of justice appropriate for the destruction in a manner similar to that of the Taliban, of many of the English religious and cultural works carried out by its fascist ‘Puritan’ followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as a \"genius\" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: -He was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell figure outside the Westminster Palace would have become a target.
The ‘iconoclasm’ of the British civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the bad Cromwell would have been sacrificed to the actions of his ancestors Thomas in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of an opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told Sunday Telegraph: -Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is sure is that the mid-17th century conflict formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure that is recognised to represent one side of that divide.
His achievements as 'Lord Protector' also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated -
Pig Kills Attack and Kills Chinese Soldiers
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig in a market in South-South China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his name -Yuan, - was found dead with a cut-artery, covered by blood next to him on the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in Hoggy on 30 May 2005 in Xining Province Qinghai, China.
Supposedly, he travelled with his cousin from the province near Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered a door to the pig’s slaughter in the open vicinity.
He said that a pig with blood was present in his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had attacked the farmer and killed, according to the report.
-Cuguine legs were buried and mutilated, - said the cousin, who referred to him with his surname -Wu, as quoted by the Guiyang Events News.
The security camera films showed Yuan entering the market on 4.40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was not of Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Events News that the pig was locked to not attack others, while the police collected evidence on the ground.
The Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for its death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking people have been recorded previously.
in 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg held a farmer from Wales to his tractor until he expelled his wife.
After the pigs of a farmer from Oregon attacked him and ate him in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba Farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but blood taste can act as a cause.
“They’re playing.
They do, they are very curious... they do not intend to hurt you.
Only you want to show them the proper amount of respect, - he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain in the south-east of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is being weakened as it moves on the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods around northern Mexico and south-east of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa brought a wind of 85 mph, Category 1 Uragan, on 5 morning at the time of Sunday, and was located 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is forming a 'trough' on the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa is approaching the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will start pushing strong tropical humidity towards the north-west of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture that interacts with the nearing trough creates a strong rain spread in the South-East in the coming days.
Locally, from 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous rapid flooding, waste streams and possible things to the desert.
A strong tropical humidity will cause rain rates to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour in parts, especially in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
From 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in parts of the South-South, especially on a large part of Arizona.
The rapid flooding is possible under rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered character of tropical rain.
It would not be a good idea to leave the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
A heavy rain can cause ‘canyons’ to become dangerous rivers and storms will bring much local inflatable winds and dust.
The 'trough' will bring some rain to parts of the southern coast of California.
Total rainfall of more than half a inch is possible, which can cause small breakthrough flows and sliding roads.
This will be the first rain in the region of their rainy season.
Some duluvens of tropical rain spread to Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rain spreads in Four Corners on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October there may be some strong temperature change across the US as the Arctic cools, but tropical areas remain rather warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There will be a great example of dramatic temperature differences from the US Centre on Sunday.
There is almost a 20-degree difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to develop and expand.
A large part of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a hot start in October with temperatures in the 80s spread from the South Poles to parts of North-East.
New York City can rise to 80 degrees on Tuesday, approximately 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecasts are indicating high possibilities for temperatures above the average for the US East during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen the hearing of Bert Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people saw the very interesting witnesses of Thursday of the nominated Supreme Court candidate Bert Kavanaugh and the woman accused of committing a sexual attack allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political fight continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming with shocking news on Friday's last minute: an agreement drawn up by the Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to carry out a week's investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that it is 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh Babasha was under the influence of alcohol and tried to remove her clothes when they were at school post-secondary.
Kavanaugh, in witness with passion, said that he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday are likely to see it.
the company was counting the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks that showed them, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen generally finds it difficult to calculate how many viewers from offices.
To put this in perspective, it is a similar audience size to that for the decisive football game or for the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the forefront of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was just followed by 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, the protesters were caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning and were playing with him as he tried to get up in the lift for a hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He remained standing with his eyes looking down for several minutes as he was being criticized aggressively, in a live broadcast on CNN.
“I stand before you,” said a woman.
Do you think it is true that you are telling the truth to a country?
They told him - you have the power when many women have nothing -
Flake said that his office issued a statement and said, before closing the lift doors, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcasting networks were broadcast directly, hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate fully for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominated person in the following week, which the Democratic minorities have long encouraged.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several sanators thereafter, Flake took his decision.
The Flake decision was empowered, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of taking policy advantage of Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union that are taking advantage of politics and weakening national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview after one with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson pressed his attack on the so-called ‘Chequers’ plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Great Britain and the EU should collect each other’s tariffs was completely protected.
Shooting at Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson after the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in shooting who killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, said the Baton Ruge Police Department.
Officials issued a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered on-site glasses and said they found Simpson DNA on them, reporting CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said they admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
Its bond has been set at $350,000, reporting the Advocate.
The chair office of East Baton Rouge's Parish parish issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying that the cause of death is damage to a gun from the head to neck.
The department is crediting the Dutch State Police Task Force of Louisiana, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area to assist in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement of the area's law for diligence and the search for justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2-metre attacker, who was raised in Baton Ruge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for the LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 ‘rebounds’ per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was lost and under shock after Wayde's death.
-This is what you worry about all the time, - said Wade.
Vulcan throws the ash on Mexico city
Ash being disposed of by the Popocatepetl vulcan reached the southern area of Mexico's capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the catalyst increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring several sounds and tactical movements.
Social media images showed thin layers of ash covering the car’s windscreens in the vicinity of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geography physicists noted an increase in volcanic activity located 45 miles (72 km) south-east of capital after a earthquake of 7.1 at the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The so-called “Don Goyo” has been active since 1994.
Police have a conflict with Catalonia separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters had a conflict with the anti-rollers police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalonia polarisation vote on the recession.
A group in favour of coverd separatists who were kept back by anti-rollers police threw eggs and powder paints, and created a cloud of dark dust on the roads that are generally full of tourists.
There were also small fighting during the day and the police had to use the hearts to control the fighting.
Over a period of several hours, groups in favour of independence were granting it - not to forget, not to apologize - to fight against unionist protesters who were shouting, -Spain For All
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries they received in protests, reported local press.
Tensions remained high in the region that wants independence one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separationists from Catalonia.
Voters have chosen to become independent, although participation has been low with those who counter-settlement who made a big boycott against the vote.
According to the Catalonia authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at voting stations across the region in violent fighting.
Independence groups had camped during the night on Friday to prevent demonstration in support of national police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separated protector with his wife said that they no longer had hope of Catalonia's prospects for independence.
Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my mother and father crying with joy that they could vote but now gave us a hand,” he said.
Despite having a vital and narrow victory in the regional elections last December, Catalonia's independence parties are sending to keep the momentum this year with many of their best known leaders or in exile who have decided themselves or in detention and are awaiting the process due to their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
-There is more and more tension, - he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of Catalonia who is in prison before the process since last year's end, announced that he will challenge the European Parliament elections next year.
-As I stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the aggression in democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government, - he said.
Londonery: Men arrested after a car entered a house with strength
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car entered more than once strongly into a home in London.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday for the battle of 19:30 BST.
Detective Bob Blemmings said that the damage was caused to the grades and to the building itself.
It could also be used 'crossbow' to shoot at the car at some point.
Goal of Menga wins 1-0 game for Livingston against Rangers
The first ‘goal’ of Dolly Menga’s for Livingston won the game
Livingston, which was promoted, swallowed Rangers and thus Steven Gerrard lost for the second time only in 18 games as a coach of the Ibrox Club.
The shooting of Dolly Menga's ball made the difference as Gary Holt's side was equal in points with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has not won once out of its Premiership in this season and the next Sunday will play against Hearts, which is first placed behind them with eight points.
Before that game, Rangers will play against Vienna Rapid in their stadium in Europa League on Thursday.
While Livingston continues not to have a loss in division in six games, with the main coach Holt who has not yet lost a game since it came instead of Kennedy Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against depressed visitors
Holt's team had long been winning before he had a 'goal', with the direct style of his games that was causing many problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but distributed the ball in front of the last one, then Alan Lithgow could only distribute the ball with a wide body after he sliding to get the ball from a sudden head on from Craig Halkett next to the last one.
Those who were playing in their own stadium were happy to let Rangers play before them, because they knew they were able to give visitors the problems at some moments.
And that was the way the crucial ‘goal’ came.
Rangers allowed ‘free-kick’ to enter and Livingston took the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to help Menga, to touch the ball and insert into the list from the center of the box.
By that time, Rangers were controlling the ball's possession, but they were finding the team's defense that they were playing in their own field, not penetrating, and the \"goalkeeper\" Liam Kelly had little trouble,
That game style continued even in the second half of the game, but Alfredo Morelos made Kelly welcome the ball.
Scott Pittman was unable to find a \"goal\" because of the \"goalkeeper\" of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow shot the ball widely after playing another liveston player.
Balls were all the time entering the Livingston box and were always removed from their players, while two requests for 'penalty' - after Halkett's attempt on the Glenn Middleton replacement, and another after the ball was handed over by a player - were rejected.
Phenomenal from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in Arena Tony Macaroni
Performance and phenomenal result for Livingston.
For a man, they were excellent, they continued to exceed expectations on this path upwards.
The style of games and their staff have not changed much from the return to the main fight, but the most credit should go to Holt for the way the team has joined since it arrived.
He had a lot of hero.
Head Halkett was very big in his games, organising a very well organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe World with seven eyes.
However, Rangers had a lack of inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at certain times under Gerrard, there was a lack of standards all the time.
Their last chance with the ball was not good - once only managed to divide the defense of the team that was playing in his own stadium - and it is a sign to Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the rating.
Erdogan received different reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) people were laughing and heard blue as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - with the aim of repairing NATO allies' relations.
They did not agree on issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then left to Cologne to open a huge new Moscow.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The Police quoted security reasons to block a large crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the Mosca, but many of its supporters soon emerged to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators against Erdogan - many Kurdi - also mentioned their voices, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome them in the country.
The protests against each other reflect the separation of a visitor who is a hero for certain German Turks and is thought to be ‘autocrat’ from others.
Road collision in Deptford: Cyclist dies in a collision with a car

Road closures and bus deviations are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officials are in trouble
Six prison officers were injured after a high-security men's prison disorder, said by the Prison Office.
The disorder started at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire for the 09:30 BST beat on Sunday and is still on.
Specialised officials - Toronto - was introduced to address the disorder, involving eight prisoners and located in one of the sections.
Officials were treated for minor on-site injuries.
Member of the Security Council of the so-called ‘Lugansk People's Republic’.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we will be clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can spend more time in prison -
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of those who committed the most dangerous crimes in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received hospital care after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October the anti-rollers were called to prison to address a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with ‘pool’ balls.
The Hurricane Rosa Threats Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with Quick Floods (Drying Areas Can Benefit)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves from the south-west of Desert, leading to rapid flood risks.
The National Timing Service has already established a rapid flood watch for Monday and Tuesday for the western Arizona to south and east of Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagst staff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to cross a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday, and closes late Monday with rain.
The National Temp Phoenix Service noted in a tweet that only 10 tropical cycles have maintained tropical weather or depression status at a distance of 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of 40 miles from the border of AZ -
The latest models of the National Urban Centre predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Amazon Rim.
Other areas of the South-South Desert including central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to have up to 2 inches in diameter, with possible isolated totals of up to 4 inches.
For those at risk of rapid flooding, the rain of Rosa can be positive as the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, some of this rain is likely to be beneficial as the South-South side is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the drought monitoring device, just over 40 per cent of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category, - reported by water.com.
First, the Orange Rosa route was led to reach the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which will still be very strong on Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, will be located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and will move north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting colder waters in the Pacific and therefore losing power.
Thus, it is expected to touch Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or early evening.
The rain in parts of Mexico can be strong, creating a significant flood risk.
A rain notation of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to the north-west of Sonora, with a possibility of not more than 10 inches, reported by water.com.
Then Rosa will move north around Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move from Arizona and south Utah until late in the evening on Tuesday.
The main danger expected by Rosa or her remains is a very severe rain in Baja California, in the north-west of Sonora, and in the north-west desert of the United States, - said by the National Centre of Jordan.
This rain is expected to produce rapidly dangerous floods for life and flood flows in the desert, and mountain terresites.
Attack in Midsumer Norton: Four arrested after attempted murder

17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon, said Sommerset Police.
Officials appealed to anyone who could have a video drawn from the mobile phone of what happened to speak.
Trump said that Kavanaugh sent the green and anger of the Democratic Party
-Vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the mercyless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party, - said Trump during a demonstration in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh sent the Green and anger of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, strongly and with the emotion denied an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually attacked decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed during the hearing on its claim.
On Saturday, the President said that, on the day of the American people saw Kavanaugh's Brave and the quality and courage.
-Vote confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of our most modern legal minds, a jurist with an impeccable public service record - he told the crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't challenge, but in truth, I'm challenging, - he said.
-So I'm running everywhere to fight for very good candidates -
Trump argued that Democrats have a mission to resist and hinder
The first main procedural vote within the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP assistant told CNN.
Hundreds were killed by the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with the number of deaths appearing to be rising
At least 384 people were killed, many were injured as huge waves fell strongly on beaches, after a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Solawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to six metres (18 feet) fell strongly on the ground when it began to fall, while many were carried and died and everything that was half dead.
The tsunami occurred after a strength earthquake of 7.5.
When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not wake up to immediately occur and end up victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for the Indonesia disaster mitigation agency BNPB while breefing in Jabart.
The tsunami did not appear alone, pulled cars, logs, homes, hit everything on the ground, said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had travelled along the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before it hit the beach.
Some people picked up the trees to escape from the tsunami and stayed alive, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photos from the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, self-turned bridges and falling and a water-circuited Moscow.
Strong shocks continued to bring the coastal city back to the coast on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes has been felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released from the huge earthquake of Friday was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
They said that the geography of the city, located at the edge of a long and narrow bay, could have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘extensive’ and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels had fallen.
The bodies of some victims were found caught under the crushing of a fallen building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake centre.
Communications - were completely sent and without information - by Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, - said from the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were going to the affected areas.
-This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse, - they said.
On Saturday, the agency was highly criticized for not knowing that tsunami hit Paulu, although officials said that the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In a video of amateurs shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard singing alarms with anxiety for the tsunami approaching people on the bottom.
In a few minutes a huge amount of water fell strongly on the beach, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not authenticate the movies immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a sharp cut in light that reduced communications across Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The authorities said that the military started sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jacob and other cities, but evacuations still need food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city was reopened only for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths well exceeds 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While the staff of the World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived strong and full in the city of Palu, where employees are being sheltered were armed Tarpolin Shellers in their office yard, they passed through the scenes of destruction on their way there, said Mr Dozeba.
He said, “I’ve been told that many homes have been destroyed.
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups started the unpleasant disaster aid process, few complained about the fact that foreign aid workers with deep competences were not allowed to travel to Palu.
Under the Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad may only start entering if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
-It is still a state-level disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, -O.K., this is a national disaster, - we can introduce international assistance but so far there is no status -
With the second night in Palu after the week's earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles of this history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy came out of a sewage.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been caught under the crushing for two days near her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national team of Paragliding, had trained two missing paragliders for Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
Other than those caught at Hotel Roa Roa, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
-As a senior person in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden, - he said.
Mr Gendon told how, in the hours after the news that the Hotel Roa circulated among the paragliding community, he sent messages with WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, marked only their departure, but did not mark their arrival.
-I think that that means that the messages have not arrived, - he said.

Mexico's AMLO promises not to use troops against civilians
Mexico's elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilian persons as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that -I will not use the military to restrict the Mexican people -
The troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when movements of left-wing students were being established in all Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
The United States shall double the funds for I.A.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in this field, says IA investor and practitioners Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after several parts of the US government made IA notices, even if there is a lack of a formal IA strategy in the US.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be the first in IA innovation by 2030.
The duplication of the IA research budget would be a good start, as all other countries are much more back from the US, and we are looking for the next revolutionary step in the IA,” Lee said.
The duplication of funds could double the possibilities that the major achievement of the next IA will take place in the United States, Lee told CNBC at an interview this week.
Lee, whose book, AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, was published this month by Howhton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent IA companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that won the player with the highest ranking of American Othello, and then was executive with Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch in China.
Lee recognised previous US government competitions in technology such as the Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when it will be the next one, to help identify the next visitors.
Lee said that researchers in the United States often have to work hard to take government grants.
Lee said, -It's not China that's removing academic leaders; corporations are doing so, -
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have employed people who inspire others from universities to work on the IA.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to strengthen their efforts in the IA.
He said, -I believe that the green paper should be offered automatically to people who have a doctorate in the IA.
The Council of State of China issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that the National Foundation of Natural Sciences of China provides funds to people in similar academic institutions for the way the National Science Foundation and other government organisations issue money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Selected Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As regards NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in IA research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that tried to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen any action in several months.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, a move that resolves a decade-long dispute with Greece that had blocked its membership offers for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbouring country in its north represents a possibility of possession of its territory and has made a veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but national opponents argue that the change undermined the ethnic identity of the population of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and a bocot campaign raised doubts as to whether participation would reach the minimum of 50 per cent necessary to make the referendum valid.
The question on the referendum's vote is read: -You are in favour of joining NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece -
Those who support the change in name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to enter bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the EU umbrella because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Scope.
Although not legally binding, sufficient members of the parliament said they would respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change in name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state electoral commission said there was no report of irregularities up to 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a capitalist, Skopje.
The PM of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dashko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country giving him the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavararkov, 54, he was arming a small palk and preparing seats in front of the tents armed by those who would make a referendum bowl.
-We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to enter strongly under our conditions, not with the command of others, said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and we are part of Euro-Asia integration.
Prime Minister Zaev states that NATO membership will bring the much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
-I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO, - said Zaev after voting.
He said that a result in favour of changing the name would be - a confirmation of our future -
A survey published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research of Macedonia said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum - an amount below that of the required participation.
Another survey, carried out by Talma TV of Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, participation shall be 50 per cent and one more vote.
If the referendum fails, it represents the first serious surprise to the government policy in favour of Western ideals from the time it took control in May last year.
See: Sergeio Aguero, the player of Manchester City, passes all Brighton's defence to the \"goal\"
Sergeo Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his ‘goal’ in 65 minutes seem very easy.
The attacker from Argentina has received a ball from half the ground at the beginning of the sequence.
An era between three Brighton defenders before a race into open space.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players with green bursts.
Fighting with one defender before fleeing much more with the edge of the Brighton box.
Then divide the ball on his left and find Sterling.
The British attacker first touched the ball in the box to resettle Aguero, who used the right foot to insert the ball into the right side of the net by passing it through the way the Brighton Mathew Ryan goalkeper.
-Aguero is sending some trouble in his legs, - said City Pep Guardiola coach to journalists.
We talked about the fact that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's how it happened.
We had the good luck of doing a ‘goal’ at that moment -
But it was Sterling that gave the initial advantage to Sky Blues in the fight of the Premier League.
That “goal” took place on 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball in a lot of way in the territory of Brighton in that action.
Send the ball right to Leroy Sane on the left side very beautifully.
Sane touched the ball a little before it led Sterling where the last.
The attacker of the Sky Blues touched the ball slightly and entered the net just before sliding into a territory where it was not supposed to enter.
City will play against Hoffenheim at the stage of the Champions League groups at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play in a passenger vs. Rockies
Since Nationals were eliminated from the possibility of competing in the decisive game, there was no reason to make an effort to get started again.
But the player so competitive Scherzer hopes he can be the ‘pitcher’ on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that Rockies have the possibility to play in the decisive game, which is in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West with one game.
The Rockies managed to gain the possibility to continue to compete with a 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday evening, but are still looking for the first division title.
-Unfortunately, we can at least have the possibility to win by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be playing at the highest level of any point I can face this year.
What do you not want to compete in those circumstances?
Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but are allegedly inclined to let Scherzer be the ‘pitcher’ in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting for 34 times, held a practice session on Thursday and will be playing as a pitcher on Sunday when he is generally resting.
The player from Washington who plays with his right hand is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 ‘strikeout’ in 220 2/3 ‘innings’ this season.
Trump's Manifestations in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation relating to the choice for his Supreme Court, Bert Kavanaugh, talking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
-In November, everything that we have done will be threatened.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is very great -- I'm struggling with it, but in truth, I'm arguing so I'm running everywhere fighting for very good candidates, - he said.
-We see this very horrible and radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now, - continued Trump.
And they are determined to take back power by using any means possible, you can see the green.
They do not care about who they hurt, who they want to fly in order to gain power and control, what they want, power and control, we will not give them -
He said that Democrats have a mission to resist and block
And I could see this over the last four days, - he said, and he was calling the Democrats - angry and green and disgruntled and disgruntled -
He referred to the Democratic Senator classified in the Senate’s Committee of the Senate Diana Feinstein on its behalf, and received many negative cries from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Has the document been issued?
Oh, uh, what is it.
No, no, I wait, first of all - the movements of her body were not positive anything - the worst movements I've ever seen -
The Labour Party is no longer a broad group.
Not tolerable to the communicationer of his opinions
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to pressure me, I did not take much.
After all, I am the most recent MP in a list of MPs of the Labour Party which was not welcomed positively - because we communicated our views.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she fought against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, irony, issues similar to those on which Jeremy did not match previous leaders.
Notice for the meeting of the Labour Party of Nottingham East on Friday declared that we want meetings to be inclusive and productive.
During the majority of my eight years as a local MP Labour, Friday's General Council meetings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a policy - cleaner and gentle - has long been forgotten if, in fact, it has ever begun in truth.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to lead the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I thought I had a similar political view began to expect me to change my mind and take positions I had never agreed with in other situations - both on national security and on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and, in truth, does not make a difference what I say - there will be an abuse of social media with a request to remove me from my MP office, denounce the centre's policy, and tell me that I do not have part of the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Yes, I know that I have had more good luck than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a lot of sexual or racist abuse every day but are never hidden from comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad group and with any motion of ‘lack of confidence’ or a change in selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
I have been advised over the last two years that I have been urged to keep my opinions for me, not to be so voiced and then everything will be right.
But I didn't get into politics to do so.
Since I entered Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, motivated by the negligence of Thatcher's government that left my comprehensive school class literally in a disastrous state, I sought to improve public services for those most in need - both as a local counsellor or as a government minister.
I have never hid my policy, even in my last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have, in any way, been confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with current governance.
For those who have promoted the motion on Friday, all I say is that when the country is moving to Brexit that will harm our families, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in truth, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to work for you and I promise you that no amount of threats that remove me from my office or political standing does not discourage me from acting in those who believe that they are your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, not yet lost once, rises above the top of the rating
Two attempts could have changed the result slightly, but there was no doubt that Ayr was right for them to win this exciting day game of the Tennt's Premiership.
At present they are the first in the ranking, the only team from all ten who have not lost once.
Finally, it was the superior defence, as well as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities, which helped the team, who was playing in his own stadium, win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
-We've got trials during our games so far, and we haven't yet lost one, so I'm happy, - he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: -Give credit to Ayr, they took advantage of better opportunities than us.
With Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, Ayr was winning, but, a yellow card from Scotland's head Roy Hughes, who was allowed to play the game from the Warriors, gave Melrose the opportunity to try and Jason Baggot made a non-converted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's victory with a 'penalty', before, in the exact middle of the game, made a 'goal' and converted an individual attempt to bring the points 17-5 to Ayr in theeus.
But Melrose began the second part of the game well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted from Baggot, reduced the gap by 5 points.
Then it stopped the game due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which came out of the grand on a stream, and as soon as the game began again, Ayr continued to take the points after an attempt by Stafford McDowell, converted by Climo.
Then, Ayr Bair Macpherson's chief agent was given a yellow card, and again, Melrose emerged aggressively when he made an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, after a period of hard pressure.
However, the team he was playing in his own stadium began to attack again, and when he was given a yellow card, Struan Hutchinson for the action he had done on Climo without the ball, from the line of 'penalty', MacPherson touched the ball with the ground at the back of the progressive Ayr group.
Climo converted, as it almost once again did from the area from which the game starts again, after Kyle Rowe collected the ball that David Armstrong met from inside the box and sent Gregor Henry, playing side by side, to the fifth attempt of the side she was playing in her own stadium.
Still Game's personality seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The character of Still Game Ford Kiran appears to be ready to enter the hospitality industry after it was discovered that it was referred to as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
Jack Jarvis' 56-year-old man on the BBC popular programme, who he writes and takes part in with his long-term partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth series will be the last one of the program, and it appears that Kirnan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the lists of official registers, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun pointed out that Kirnan was seeking to engage in the trading of the very good restaurants - of Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes that the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
Seafarers watch the naval headquarters equipped with ropes and chains in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue ocean flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered by the moto: -The sea is our right.
Recovery is a duty -
Around all Bolivia, which is surrounded by the ground, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict of resources remains clear - as the wish for Bolivians to be able to sail in the Pacific Ocean again.
That hope is perhaps at its highest in decades, as Bolivia expects a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
- Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and is obviously waiting for the outcome with a positive mindset,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the CGI's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague finds, in favour of Bolivia's statement, that - after decades of irregular talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate and give Bolivia a sovereign outlet for the sea.
Evo Morales, the indigenous president of Bolivia - facing a controversial battle for his re-election next year - also has much to lose in Monday's decision.
We are very close to having access to the Pacific Ocean again, he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favour of Bolivia - and that few changes would do so.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant the territory of Chile, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the ICJ judgment only comes six months after the final arguments were heard, indicates that the case - it was not complicated - said Paz Zárate, an expert from Chile in international law.
And away from the Bolivia case, the last four years could not have been helpful.
The issue of access to the sea was seized by the current Bolivian administration, said Zárate.
Morales' hostile rhetoric weakened any residual goodwill of Chile, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will, at some point, continue to speak, but it will be very difficult to discuss after this.
Both countries have not been participating ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an extraordinary opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile and the opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, was using the maritime issue as political aid.
- Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean, - it added.
-The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past -
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can trust the United States
North Korea's Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Young Ho says that his nation will never denuclearize nuclear weapons is the first if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri had spoken on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to carry out its promises at a Singapore summit between rival leaders.
Its comments are received as soon as the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to have come to resume nuclear diplomacy that is located more than three months after Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
It says that it’s an empty hope that the ongoing sanctions and the U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will never force North Korea to surrender.
Washington is concerned about whether to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang making the first significant steps of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want the second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is serious to give up armament that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion performances reveal the latest collection of massive headwear that will soon appear in the main shops.
If you want to add to your hat collection or cover fully the sun, you can stop looking.
Valentino and Tom Browne designers revealed a range of strange and very large headwear for their spring and summer 2019 collection on the route that won the Paris Fashion Week style set.
Very impracticable hats are appearing on Instagram this summer and these designers have raised their surprising creations on stage.
The article mostly featured by Valentino was an extravagating beige wicked with a wide-angle peach-like edge covering the model heads completely.
Other accessories of very large size included gel-coated watermelons, a cruiser's hat and even ananas - but are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had the lips torn and were more like Hanibal Lecter than ‘haute cuture’.
One creature resembled the complete honeybee with a snorkel and goggles, while another was like a turded ice cream.
And if you continue with this good style.
Fashion followers predict that huge ‘bonnets’ will soon appear in the main stores.
The very large hats come out after the release of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a wide edge of two feet worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The 'cult label' responsible for the shoulder that is practically virtually virtually nothing that appeared on the social media brought another great conversation on the stage - a straw bag containing almost as much as the mesh dress model it was carrying.
The dark orange spray bag, surrounded by the small swag of the scalp and with white skin grips, was the most striking creation in the spring and summer 2019 collection of Jacquemus in Paris Fashion Week.
Famousist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I'm waiting to see hats and large seabags in the main shops for the next summer - since the designer has made a huge impact, it will be very difficult to ignore demand for very large accessories.'
John Edward: Essential language skills for global citizens
Independent schools of Scotland keep a record of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which is only reinforced with individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalised school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain the subject of a popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak a man in a language that understands, he understands with his mind.
If you speak his own language, understand with his heart
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examinations, we can see that languages are at the forefront of the rating tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a Higher A grade.
The data, collected from the 74 school members of the SCIS, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a higher degree A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of German scholars, 69 per cent of French scholars and 63 per cent of Spanish studyers also obtained A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
The languages now, as a subject option, are being kept in the same respect as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that for reasons that employers have given themselves to filling vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly imperatives to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career of choosing, if you learn another language, it will have a real advantage in the future as it has the ability to stay through such a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the forefront of competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and, by 15 per cent, French is the only spoken language with two per cent numbers.
That is why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
Knowing more than one language, particularly those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding a significant job.
In Scotland, each school will learn different languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to be successful, whatever the future.
It cannot currently be denied, in a global business environment, that languages remain very important for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be seen as - international communication skills -
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
The fat son no faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
On Sunday LeBron will play for the first time with Lakers in San Diego
LeBron James' sports fans were no longer expecting him to start for the first time for Los Angeles Lakers.
The coach of Lake Walton announced that James will play in the opening game before starting the season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the amount of minutes to play still has to be determined.
-It will be more than one and less than 48, - said Walton on the official Lakers website.
The reporter Mike Trudwell wrote a tweet that, probably, James will play a limited amount of minutes.
After the practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six match schedule before the Lackers season begins.
“At this stage of my career I don’t need pre-season games to prepare myself,” he said.
Manifestation of Trump in West Virginia, Youtube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of campaign demonstrations tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first demonstration from five scheduled next week, including stops in amicable places including Tennissee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation suspended for its choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in Nov.
At a time is Trump's demonstration in West Virginia tonight and how do you see it online?
The demonstration of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, 29 September, 2018.
You can see Trump's demonstration in West Virginia online below through a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for the nomination of the Supreme Court Bert Kavanaugh, which has become intense due to allegations of sexual misconduct with an advance confirmation vote of the Senate suspended for up to one week while investigating the FBI.
But the primary objective of this wave of demonstrations is to help the Republicans face the November elections to obtain some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said these five demonstrations next week are aimed at giving energy to volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
-The Congress Control is so important for this agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we approach the campaign season committed, - he told Reuters a spokesman for Trump's campaign that has rebutted his name.
A schedule for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's exhibition can collect fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the media of Pittsburgh, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month Trump will be visiting West Virginia, the state that won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate of the Republican Senate of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is losing in the survey.
It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to boost the survey,” said Simon Hader, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: The United States Team determined not to give up on Sunday's singles
After three sessions of one side, Saturday's Foursomes in the afternoon could have been exactly what she needed this Ryder Cup.
The momentum swing pendulum is a concept of sport completely invented but one that players really believe in, and never more than in such competitions.
So where do they say you are the momentum now?
-These were six-point fronts and are now four, so I think we are carrying this as a little momentum,” said Jordan Spieth as he left during the day.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, four points in front with twelve more to be played.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel but have little and much to encourage, not at least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each open with three points from four.
Spieth was accurate from tea to green and is running with an example.
That cry from the heart of a celebration continued to grow as he continued his round, making a crucial put to bring the fourth equal game when he and Thomas were two under two.
His daughter who won the game on 15 was welcomed by a similar call, the kind he tells you to believe that the American team is still there.
-Vera wants to enter deep and worry about your own item,” said Spieth.
This is what each of these players have left behind now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the uncontested history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but sweet couple are four with four and are considered perfect.
\"Molywood\" was the only pair that didn't score a bogie Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogies Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and 9:00 a.m.
That run, and the way their energy is moving towards and from this live crowd establishes that they are the players that are challenging Sunday, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory as the sun falls on Le Golf National from Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both suddenly on different holes.
But here we are talking about an early European glory.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson quickly finished by Sergeio Garcia, the hero of morning footballs, when he was placed in a partnership with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the front nine brought the Spanish and Swedish into a hole that they had never been able to get out of.
But Sunday, there's no one to help you get out of your hole.
Forballs and forwardsomes are very interesting to see them closely due to peer-to-peer interactions, advice they give, advice they do not give and how a strategy can be changed in a second.
Europe has played better as a team so it has arrived and is in the lead on the final day, but this course of forwardsomes has also shown that the United States Team has determined that some, especially on the part of the United States, were questioning.
Europe ahead with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take a good advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after it was released from Saturday's football and forwards with 10-6 on the US.
The inspired pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a two-winning effort on Tigger Woods that found it difficult to take their score so forward at Le Golf National for four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, ready to keep the trophies lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American side that went wrong in the morning footballs, which took the series by 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in forwardsomes, winning two matches, but could not reach the difference in score.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from one of Sunday's 12 players to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first new European for the season to win four points after each other while he and Molinari, vaccinated -Molliwood - after a sensuous weekend are only the second pair to win four of their four opening parties in the history of the Ryder Cup.
Having dominated Woods and Patrick Reed in the footballs then worked excellently to win Woods that did not seem optimistic and the new American player for the Bryson Dechambeau season with even more immersive score of 5&4.
Woods, who found difficulty in both parties on Saturday, showed occasional moments of vanity but now lost 19 out of his 29 matches in football and forwardsomes and seven after each other.
Justin Rose, an inspiration for morning footballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes for a 2&1 loss by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - which are ranked the first and third in the world.
But it wasn't everything that Europe wanted on a beautiful day, with a little shrinking in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a big winner for three times, and Justin Thomas set the threshold for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2&1 victory over John Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in football and later returned to win Poulter and Roy McIllroy with 4&3 in Foursomes after losing both opening holes.
It was only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team returned from a four-point difference while it was entering the singles, although Furyk's holders needed a draw to keep the trophies.
However, after being the second best for two days, Sunday’s counterattack seems to be more than they can do.
North Korea says that -in no way - it will unilaterally dislodge without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continuing sanctions were deepening its lack of confidence in the United States and that there was no way that the country would leave its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ry Young Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken - considerable good will measures - last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site, and promised not to prolife nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we do not see a corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
Without any trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no way disintegrate ourselves unilaterally first.
While Ri repeated familiar complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a phase-by-step approach to denuclearisation in which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement appeared significantly not to reject unilateral denuclearisation without thinking as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work towards denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea was looking for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls to reduce the tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States insists on denuclearisation first and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a coherent way, and also objects to the end of the war statement,” Ri said.
-The perception that sanctions can break us is a dream of people who do not know about us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions are deepening our lack of trust -
Ri did not mention plans for the second Kim-Trump summit that the US leader highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: -If the party to this denuclearisation issue was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a blockade.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the targeting of the United States mainland land with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after Mr. Kattiv - Trump called Kim - a rocket man - on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, that last year threatened to - completely eradicate - North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to dismantle, but said that a lot of work remains to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearises.
Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this, saying - If it takes two, three or five months - it does not make a difference -
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Thursday, told the UN Security Council that: - The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions should continue vigorably and without stopping until we realize fully and finally verified denuclearisation -
The Security Council unanimously reinforced the sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with a view to stopping funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, after he criticized North Korea for making claims like a gangster.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the US takes corresponding measures.
He said that Kim had told him that the corresponding measures he was looking for were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students do a course on taking enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year was able to make all of its students who have not yet gone to bed more with the aim of fighting the growing macho culture that studies all night and remains raised by caffeine.
Academic found that university students in the first place in the world often do not have an idea about basic real things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which believes it is his first type in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after speaking about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
-At last she was a girl on me and said: ‘Why are you telling me this now, in my last year?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping - to surprise me, - told The Telegraph.
The course, which began for the first time this year, explains to students essential things about how good sleep traditions help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and university health services executive, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a student sleep room, where students click on coffee cups, curtain, trainers and books to reduce the effects of caffeine and light and on how athletic performance has an effect on sleeplessness, and the importance of a sleeptime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term insomnia can increase the risks of heart attacks, seizures, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
-We know that it will not change the student’s behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - as much as you have the right to know the effects on health when choosing to smoke cigarettes, - added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of being proud that you have been able to stay up all night studying still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleeplessness was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you sleep well, and of good quality, it should be a student's secret weapon to fight stress, severe fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid increasing weight, as sleep puts the brain in a state of hunger, which makes them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, who is studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler draw up the course, after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to insist on a course across the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students who have graduated to undertake a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students should consider making an alarm when they go to bed, as well as when they wake up, and know about the harmful effects of a blue light that comes out of electronic screens and LED light, which can debalance your circadian rhythm, and lead to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's Goal disrupts Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another period of sadness when they played abroad as Dolly Menga’s strike delivered Steven Gerrard’s separate side for a 1-0 loss in Livingston.
The Ibrox side was seeking to record their first victory while travelling from February 4-1 in St Johnstone, but Gary Hold's team only caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 matches as manager to leave eight points away from the top leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time and the list of players of Rangers lack inspiration never seemed to be reached.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third and only after Hibernian on a difference of goal.
And there may be more trouble for Rangers after the linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently throwing an object from the fans of the team who played abroad.
Gerrard made eight changes to the last side from Ayr to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Live 11 that took a point from Hearts last week and would have been happy in how his well-trained form prevented their opponents constantly.
Rangers could dominate the possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They had to score only two minutes from the start when Menga's first-time play-off sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder took his great chance.
Keaghan Jacobs' strong free-kick then found Skyper Craig Halkett but his defender partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot back.
Rangers gained control but appeared to have more hope than belief about their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he had to have a penalty on the 15-minute mark as he and Steven Lawless faced but referee Steven Thompson ignored the appeal of the Communists.
Rangers managed to target only two beaches in the first half of the party but Ibrox Liam Kelly's former goalkeeper hardly worried him at the head of Lassana Coulibally and Ovie Ejaria's light strike.
While Livi's first goal in 34 minutes could have been when the other team was playing better, no one could deny that he was just right for their effort.
Once again, Rangers failed to manage Jacobs' good set-piece.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher shoots the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga to end the action.
Gerrard responded to the brake by changing Coulibally with Ryan Kent and the change almost provided an immediate impact as the winder shoots at Morelos but the impressive Kelly took off from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors to play just the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett who caught a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's side could extend their position in the final stages but McGregor was well kept to deny Jacobs before Lithgow went open from the corner.
The substitute for Rangers Glenn Middleton had a request at the other delay for penalty as he argued with Jacobs but once again Thomas saw the other side.
Almanak: Inventor of Geiger Contour
And now a page from our Almanac of Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, like today 136 years today, and NANIA WE ARE FULL... the day on which future physicist Johannes Willelm-Hans-Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Contagor.
Pedestal of science since then, Geiger's Contagor has become the foundation of pop culture as well, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, in which those unlikely cookboys scientists look up Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What kind of man is she?
Rogers: -This Geiger Contactor, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these boxes, you can currently hear the effects of the atoms that give radioactivity in the minerals -
Evans: - Say, sure it's popular now! -
-Hans - Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he reached 63 years.
But the invention by his name remains alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see cells with abnormal behaviour
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to - see - cells with abnormal behaviour and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour as part of the treatment
Method involves extraction of immune cells from a patient, which is converted into a laboratory
They can then - visit a protein common to many cancers and then be re-injected
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extraction of immune cells from a patient, these are converted into a laboratory so that they can see a protein common to many cancers called HER2, then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the United States National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: -Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine -
HER2-promoting the growth of various types of cancer, - including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and how they are taught - how cancer cells have been targeted in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West made a Favur Trump Verbal Attack, while wearing an MAGA Berita, after his appearance on SNL.
This Is Not a Good Thing
Kanye West was booked in the studio during Saturday Night Live following a confusion performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would be released for election in 2020.
After singing his third night song, which is called Ghost Town, in which he wore Make America Great, he began to say against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Many times I talk to a white person and say: ‘How can you please Trump, that racist?’
If I was concerned about racism, I had just left America, - he said.
SNL started the comedy programme in which Matt Damon appeared in which the Hollywood star rediscovered Bert Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it did not broadcast, West's video was uploaded on social media by journalist Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to shake you with West when he placed it.
In addition, West was a complaint with the audience that they had caught with him after the quinta about his berth.
-Blue me after the quintet.
Say, do not go out there with that baritta.
Bullet me!
Then they say that it's lost, - said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: -You want to see the losers? and he said that he would wear my superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what I'm doing.
Try with love -
His comments scrambling at least twice by the audience and members of the SNL cast appeared welcome, reported Variety, with one person there who told the publication:
West brought him as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend had, the Mac Miller rapper had died a few days ago.
West has been deeply involved in the performance of I Love it, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West was supported by the TPUSA conservative group president, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: -To one of the most courageous spirits: GRANTS TO DEVELOP THE FOLLA.
But the presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply what he and this is a great thing.
-But I did not choose to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his art) who believes that he is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So much more, she added it.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now - what was previously known as Kanye West -
It is not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Dady, Puffy and P Diddy.
The former rapper, Snoop Dog had the name Snoop Lion and of course the legend of music that was no longer with us Prince, changed his name to a symbol then the artist who was previously known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Kit Harington speaks about toxic maculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as John Snow in the series of violent middle fantasy of HBO Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor spoke about the stereotypes of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that the inventor often feels that they must be violent to be respected.
Speaking with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that \"something went wrong\" and had doubts about how to address the problem of toxic maculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old Consulate of Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also admitted that he had a strong interest in addressing the issue.
-Personally, I feel that I have a strong interest, right now - where did we go wrong with mysculinity?,” he said.
-What were we teaching men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we now have?
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic maculinity through its very male characters.
He continued: - What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, which makes the boy feel like he wants to be this certain side of a man?
I think this is one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because it is very clear that something has gone wrong for the inventor -
In the interview he also admitted that he will not make prequels or sequences of Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, saying that -so wars and horses -
Since November Kit will appear in the new Sam Shepard's True West production, which is the history of a film producer and his brother, which he has left.
Recently the actor revealed that when he met his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
-I met my wife on this program, then in this way gave me my future family, and my life thereafter, - he said.
Rose interpreted the part of Ygrite, the love interest of Kit's character, John Snow, in the series of fantasy she won at Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, say health officials.
Only around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV quickly spread to parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people taking HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, one year after another, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission from sex is an acute problem in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was demarcated in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is said to be common.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who are sexually related to men will eventually marry women.
Many transmissions of disease come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of staff has revealed GOP teachers' data, says dangerous lies and comfort theories.
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of its staff placed the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that the claims were spreading from ultra-right pundits and websites.
-Gids, lies and more of the lies of the stellar, - said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information allegedly released included home addresses and telephone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill at a hearing of the Senate panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court’s nomination.
The disclosure took place some time after the three sanators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts was associated with the Office of Waters and released the information of a staff member of Waters, reported the Hill.
-This baseless claim is completely false and absolute lie, - continued Waters.
-My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and absolute lie
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from the previous White House Ari Fleischer press secretary.
“This denial is one of anger,” wrote Fleischer.
-This suggests that he does not have the time to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something that he has not done, he should not be angry.
It must not be resistant.
It shall not question the motives of the accused.
It shall be calm and seren -
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' response to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being very angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will come to take Waters' seat in the mid-term elections, also mentioned his voice on Twitter.
-This is something great if it is true, - he said on Twitter.
In its statement, Waters said that its office had instructed appropriate law enforcement authorities and entities about these fraudulent claims.
-We will make sure that the authors will be detected, - continued, - and that they will be legally liable for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to each and all members of my staff.
Criticism of Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson, imitation of a powerful spirit
It has now been traditional to look for Brexit's meanings in any new film with a British perspective, which seems to be applicable to the return of Johnny English's impression-communicative action-impression franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and relived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is iron self-sacrificing on the subject of how bad we are of course, the opportunity for a new export of the country?
At any rate, rival Johnny English with great eyes and parts of his face moving unusually had the renewed licence for the second time to do everything wrong - his name more than anything else shows that it is a widespread comic creation designed for the territories of non-English-speaking cinemans.
Of course, he is a stopic secret agent who despite his strange claims to his sweet fascism has a few of Clouseau, a hit by Mr Bean and a large part of that man who contributed one note to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in London.
He is also originally based on the travellers and the international man of mystery who once at Atkinson had made his part in Barclycard TV ads, today forgotten, after leaving a caos behind him.
There is a beautiful moment or two in this latest issue of the JE.
I liked the moment when Johnny English had moved to a helicopter while he was wearing a medjevalized dress and the blade blades caught his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy appears, but humor is felt rather strangely poor, especially since the film's brands - like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves offer comedy as a confident ingredient.
Humorism is felt as if targeted at children than adults, and for me the strange unfortunate incidents of Johnny English were not as innovative and focused as the joke of Atkinson's voiceless film in Bean's person.
The perennial topical assumption now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker filtered the very secret web network of British Spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, for the disappointment of the agent who was on the job - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the ring on the cake for the first prime minister, which is an impregnable and difficult figure, already suffering from a complete collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson makes her best with this character like Teresa May but there is little in the script to work.
Its intelligence advisors inform her that each active spy has been compromised, will have to bring someone retired.
And this means the inventor Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in an elegant building, but gives non-official lessons about how to become an infiltrate operating: I'm just having a good shot here as English offers a school of Rock.
English is taken back to Whitehall for emergency meetings and joins his former long-suffering partner, Bowgh, once again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bowgh is now a married man, with a submarine commander, the role of a bridedress interpreted by Vicki Pepperdine, in which she is little drunk.
The two inseparables that always confuse everything in its Siege Service, are therefore back in action, when they meet the character of a sedient and beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova interpreted by Olga Curylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the rule of the hard-tech billionaire who claims that he can solve the problems of the British computer: the President Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey of fun behaviour: dressed as a weaver, giving fire to a high French restaurant, creating caos to climb on Volta's luxury yacht; and English begins a full anarchy as he tries to use virtual reality offices to familiarize himself with Volta's house interior.
Certainly all stops lead to that latest sequence, but as amicable and animated as it is, it has little idea of children's television.
Something quite moderate.
And like other Johnny English films, I couldn't think: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really deserves his talent?
Labour refuses to prepare a plan for the British to work a four-day week but paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that will see the British work a week of four days - but to be paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the company learner to pass on the remains of the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to workers by giving them another day of savings.
This would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but still take the same pay.
Sources said that the idea would be right with the party's economic agenda and plans that the country would turn towards workers.
The four-day shift was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: -A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
-This will not happen tomorrow, but a four-day work week is an expectation that fits the party's approach to balancing the workers' economy again as well as the party's global industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to approve such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, the aspiration is currently not being approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
A speaker for the Labour Party said: - A four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it -
Oppositor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to take back power from anonymous directors and profit-seekers in utility firms.
The opposition's plan also means that current shareholders in water companies may not take their full share back as a Labour government can make a reduction - on the basis of perceived misconduct.
It also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create inclusive Residential Funds to provide 10 per cent of the equity of private sector firms to employees, ready to take annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes - if Kavanaugh's FBI investigation can change their understanding
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brit Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by a week, and raised the question of whether the findings of the boureau could influence any Republican senate from withdrawing his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes’ correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that led them to change their understanding.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
-Hight, and sure, said Kennedy.
-I said and came to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
Did you call him after that, after he made that claim, I said, ‘Have you done it?’
He was resolved, determined, inequivocal -
However, Graham's vote seems difficult to change.
-I've already decided about Robert Kavanaugh and must be a very big charge,” he said.
-Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett rejected it strongly, - he added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
-And any person mentioned cannot verify this.
It is 36 years old.
I have not seen anything new change.
What is the Global Citizens Festival and Do What to Reduce Poverty?
Next Saturday New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event that has a very impressive list of stars that will appear and another equally impressive mission; ending world poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizens Festival will see tens of thousands of people heading into the Great Law of Central Park not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Schneider Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the true purpose of the event ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Government Project, a representative group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay a VIP ticket), the concerters had to complete a series of tasks, or actions - such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a call or some other significant ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizens been by the remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea that people will be rewarded with a free concert is a genuine way to force people to ask for a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called \"clictism\" - people feel that they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizens has registered more than 19 million actions - than those they place, which I strive for a number of different objectives.
This states that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announced from its actions, at least $10 billion of which were already deposited or collected.
The group estimates that secure funds have so far made a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementingrs committed to helping children grow to their full potential, - promising Rwanda to provide $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
-With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can do the social injustice of nutrition a footnote in history, - said The Power of Nutrition Racer Ullman Ambassador to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to invite the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequent questions on its website that you ask - what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty? -
Global Citizen replied: -It will be a long and hard journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like large civil rights movements and anti-apartheid, we will succeed, because we have more power when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Schen Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the artists who will appear at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and High Jackman.
US uses the Navali Fleet to block - to hinder Russian energy exports - Internal Secretariat
If necessary, Washington can resort to its Navali Fleet to prevent Russian energy from affecting markets, including the Middle East, revealed US Secretary-General Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's growth in Syria - especially, where it operates with a legitimate government invitation - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
-I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern side of Europe, - allegedly said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of addressing it.
The United States has the ability, with our Navali Fleet, to ensure that seacourses are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy has not reached the market,” he said.
Zinke was addressing those who attended the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that portrays himself as the ‘energy consumer voice’ in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approaches in addressing Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
-The economic choice on Iran and Russia is, too little or too little fuel leverage and replacement,” he said, referring to Russia as -someone with a single ability - with a fuel-dependent economy.
The following statements are due to the fact that Trump's administration was on a mission to strengthen its liquidated natural gas exports to Europe, by replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to force Germany to exit the gas-gas project - inappropriate - Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin the “serial” of Moscow.
Moscow has often stressed that Nord Stream 2 gas of $11 billion, which is expected to double the existing gas capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Commission therefore concludes that the aid is compatible with the internal market and that the aid is compatible with the internal market and is not compatible with the internal market.
-I believe that we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers, - said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of Germany for industry, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), invited the United States to stay away from Europe's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
-I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Ser -Treasure Two - If You Do Not Go to a President in 2020, says the Senator of Massachusetts
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he will - well-examine - whether to go to a president after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting of the council in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he thought he would come out.
-It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government and this includes a woman in the highest position,” said The Hill.
-After 6 November, I will examine whether I will go out for a president -
Warren commented on President Donald Trump at the council meeting, saying he was taking this country in the wrong direction.
-I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren was direct in her criticism of Trump and his nomination for the Supreme Court Bert Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said - of course we need an FBI investigation before voting -
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that a majority of Waren's own constituents do not think it should run for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of voters - likely - of Massachusetts said that the Senator should not be released for the election, according to the survey of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe’s Political Research Centre.
Thirty-two percent supported the election issue.
The survey showed further support for the election issue by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a possible election release and 48 percent against him.
Other high profile Democrat names discussed in relation to a potential issue for the 2020 election include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he officially decided by January, reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin refers to the PTSD of Track Palin in the demonstration of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after it was registered in September
He was arrested and brought to trial on a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
What my son is going through, what he's going through after returning, I can relate to other families who feel the PTSD Ramifications and some of the wounds that our soldiers return to, - told the audience at a demonstration for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest - the obvious problem that no one is addressing - and said about her son and other war veterans, -they return a little different, go back stronger, think if there is respect for what other soldiers like them and air personnel, and any other member of the army, gave the country -
He was arrested on Monday in Wesila, Alaska, and was brought before an attack of domestic violence on a woman, while interrogating with a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons while he was drunk, according to this Bennet, a spokesman for the Wesilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports a challenge for a new asylum policy
Eighty states and the Columbia District are supporting a legal challenge for a new policy of the United States that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and district, Friday brought a case of a court friend in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the actor in the case of Grace against Sessions which the American Union of Civil Liberties in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said that her partner - and the boys members of his violent gang - abused her but U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
It was kept in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, as nations face explosive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy saw a 2014 decision by the Board of Appeal of Migrants which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
On Friday, in a statement, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said that the new policy - ignores decades of state, federal and international law -
-Federal law requires all asylum claims to be judged on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a plea infringes that principle, said the case of a court friend.
Bars continued to argue in the event that the policy to deny entry to immigrants harms the US economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and provide the necessary work.
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to cease granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
- Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion, - Sessions said in his policy announcement on 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all problems -- even all serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Exploited rescue efforts in Palu as the number of deaths doubled in a fight against the time to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become increasingly tragic.
-It feels very intense, - said a 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while she was taking her son with fever at a evacuation centre in the sad city of Palu.
-Every minute ambulance brings the body.
Clean water is scarce
Residents appeared to return to their destroyed homes, looking for their stuff burned with water, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, destroyed by a 7.5-size earthquake, were too filled.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a back and shoulder fracture, remained outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to ongoing health shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he reported that he felt the violent earthquake moving the hotel floor in the fifth floor he was using with his wife and daughter.
-There was no chance of saving ourselves.
I crushed with the remains of the wall, I think, - Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in place for a wedding.
I listened to my wife crying for help, then a silence.
I do not know what happened to her and her sons.
I hope they are safe -
The US ambassador accuses China of \"bullying\" with propaganda ads.
A week after an official Chinese newspaper released an ad on four pages in a daily US newspaper trying to sell the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to China Daily's paid supplement to the Des Moines Register - the most widely sold newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the US Congress elections of 6 November, accused China of rejecting it.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections marked what US officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in a campaign that is coming to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to make ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a trade war that they see going through tariff rounds on imports of each of them.
China's retaliation tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa who supported the Republican Trump Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the long-term governor of Iowa, a leading exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad on an opinion page in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, -now double this buliing by making propaganda in our own free press -
In spreading its propaganda, the government of China is using America’s dear tradition of free expression and free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” wrote Brandstad.
In contrast, on the newspaper stand down the road here in Beijing, you will find voices of limited dissemination and you will not see a true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people can have on China's problematic economic path, as the media is under a restriction of the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that - one of China's most prominent newspapers avoids the offer to publish - his article, although he did not say what newspaper.
Republicans Discounting Female Votants Before the Mid-term Elections with the Kavanaugh debate, Alert Analysts
As many Republicans of the top are supporting and defending the nomination of the Supreme Court Bert Kavanaugh while facing various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that they would see an adverse reaction, particularly during the next mid-term elections.
The emotions about this have been very high, and most Republicans are already officially showing that they wanted to run by vote.
These things cannot be reversed, - said Grant Reeher, political science professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeh said he questioned that the last minute push of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not be forgotten tomorrow nor in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national speaker for the MoveOn progressive group on Friday, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators sang on November! - as they protested in the Senate hall as the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to run with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, reported by Michael.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high, said St. Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst to the news site.
-People are saying that they were already high; and true.
-But they may be higher, in particular between female voters who turn the vote into sub-votings and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, while they do not like the president, often they do not vote.
Even before Ford's public statement detailing its allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's nominated, analysts suggested that it could follow an adverse reaction if the Republicans run with confirmation.
-This has become a complete riot for the GOP, - said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
This does not only concern the vote of the committee or the final vote on whether Kavanaugh is placed on the bank, it also concerns the way the Republicans managed this situation and how they dealt with it, - indicate to the news station Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somehow divided over those who believe in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with little more support for the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents believed definitely or probably the Ford statement, while 35 per cent said they believed in the finality or probably the Ford statement.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his statement, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the push by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations brought by Ford as well as at least another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh while he was an attack at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court's nominated had exposed his genitals to her while they were at two festivals while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new Internet to compete against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, will launch a new business that seeks to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company building on Berners-Lee's solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee explained that the intention after Inrupt is a -domaination of the world -
-We want to do it now, - said about the new business.
-This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own ‘personal online data store’ or POD.
This may contain contact lists, what to do, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one and all browsers at the same time.
What makes the online data store a unique personal data shop is that it is completely in the hands of the user who can access what type of information.
The company calls this personal autonomy via data.
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce's CEO, is that the company brings resources, process skills and appropriate skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform brought by IBM, some staff developers who have a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
By starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a full change where all their business models are turned down from today to tomorrow.

Bernard Vann: Clerical Celebration of the Victoria Cross of the First World War
The only cleric of the Church of England who won Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was celebrated in his village 100 years later.
Lt Cur The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack in Bellenglese and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he won the highest British military honor.
Saturday revealed a monumental stone from his two grandsons in a Parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was a brilliantly symbolic that the stone had to be revealed exactly 100 years after the victory of his grandfather's prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt Cur led his battle against the Canal de Saint-Quentin - in many fog and fire from on-site rifles and machine guns.
Later he rushed to the fire line and with the greatest courage - led the line forward before he went to a gun on the spot alone and lost consciousness three of the troops.
The Lt Cur was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72-year-old, said that his grandfather's actions were - something I know I can never get there but something very humiliating -
He and his brother Dr James Vann also placed a girl after the show, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was very honored to have played a role in this paradox and added the courage of a genuine hero was being shown by the support that many people will give.
MMA supporters remained up all night to see Bellator 206, instead of finished with Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you've been raised all night to see Bellator 206 packed to end up being deprived of seeing the main event.
The list from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and were being displayed live during the night in the UK on Channel 5.
On 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were surprised when the broadcast was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they remained up to early hours especially for the fight.
One party on Twitter described the change to children's carton as some kind of flat joke.
-It is a government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was not appropriate therefore had to switch to children's programmes, - said Dave Schwartz, vice-president of Bellator's marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.
-Peppa the pig, no yes
Belator Scott Coker’s president said they will work on their scheduling to include viewers from the UK in the future.
-I think when I think about the repetition, we probably can fix something,” Coker said.
-But right now there are six Sunday mornings and we will not be able to arrange until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we are working on it.
Embroidery, when the broadcast was turned over there were many ongoing messages and not all were sweet.
We were trying to fix the solution, we thought it was a technical error.
It was not, however, a governmental matter.
I can promise you that the next time you are not going to run.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to deliver more to the fans and instead we went too far.
It's a sad situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt -inferior' due to sex
The Olympic Tom Daily slitting says that he felt inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but it gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old man said that he had not realized until he went to the secondary that - not everyone like me -
Speaking of the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also said that when he became a parent he became less concerned with winning the Olympics.
The regular programme presenter, Kirsty Young, took a few months to run due to diseases.
While it appeared as a person dismissed on Laverne's first programme, Daley said that he felt - less than - and grew up because - it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls.
He said: -To date, those emotions that feel less than, and feel different, were the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.
He wanted to prove that he had something to say, not to disappoint everyone when he eventually became aware of his sexuality.
The Bronze Olympic medalist twice became a high profile promoter for LGBT and used his appearance in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to criminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky that he could live freely without surprises and wanted to give others hope.
The world winner three times said that when he became a man he loved a man - a film producer from the United States Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - she was a surprise to him.
Dayy married Oscar's winner, 20 years older than him, last year but said that the age difference was never a problem.
When he passed through so many things such a young age - he went to his first Olympics at 14 years and his father died with cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar beautiful experiences.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his ‘all perspective’ had changed.
-If you asked me last year, for me the important thing was to ‘win a gold medal’,’ he said.
-You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie-
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dayy said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the things he had asked was if he had already had tickets for London 2012 - since he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t say ‘You won’t be here to be in the front row, pà’,” he said.
-I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and was not until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally acknowledged that he was not intuitive,” he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the Bronze.
-I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - that I was in front of a crowd from countries in Olympic Games, there was no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspires the first choice of his song - Heather Small Proud - which was compatible with it in the march to the Olympics and still got the cold.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson who is no longer in shape remains on the bank in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will make a record Saturday when playing his 47 game of the Ryder Cup, but will have to change its form to avoid being an important stage not so happy.
Mickelson, who plays at the binary event for a record of 12 times, remained on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's football and forwardsomes.
Instead of being the centre of action, as was often for the United States, the big five-time winner divided his day between supporting and working on his game from the distance with the hope that he would correct what he was worried about.
One who would never have given the ball right even in the fill of his career, the 48-year-old man is not ideal for Le Golf National's difficult racetrack, where the long distance ruffed once after the other punishs wrong shots.
And if the course alone isn't enough heartbreaking, Mickelson, in Sunday's 9th game, faces the exact match of British Open Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, new for the season, to win all their four games this week.
If the Americans, with four points below the beginning of the 12 single game, start well, the game of Michaelson can prove to be a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say anything else.
He fully understood his role today, taped me on my back and put his arms around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” said Furyk.
“I have a lot of confidence in myself.
It is Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably wouldn’t have seen him play two parts.
I saw more, but this is the way it worked and this is the way we thought it would go.
He must be out there, like others -
Mickelson will miss Nick Faldo's record for the most items of the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
This can mark the end of a career of the Ryder Cup which has almost never reached the miles of its unique record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halfs, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible things to the team.
-He's a sarcotic, funny, funny, he likes to laugh with people, and a very good man to get in the team's room, - he explained.
-I think younger players have enjoyed criticising him this week, which was something fun to see.
It provides much more than simply games -
European Captain Thomas Bjorn that the big front position can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the European master, knows from experience that a sizeable front position before the last day singles in the Ryder Cup can easily be changed into a comfortable journey.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros held an advantage of five points on the Americans but ended with a tear with a narrow true margin, with a win of 141-2-131-2.
You still remember that we had a big front position in Valderrama; we had a big front position in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with little, said Bjorn, in the press, after seeing the 2018 Class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday to go ahead with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
This is why history will show me and everyone in this team that has not yet finished.
Tomorrow you go with your soul and body.
Get out there and do all the good things.
It is not yet finished until you have brought the points on the team.
We have a purpose, and what he tries to welcome this trophies, and the focus will remain there.
I've always said, focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we know very well what the other side is - the world's biggest players -
Depending on how his players played on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: - Never go an oltrè step from me in this.
Tomorrow a different challenge.
It still concerns the individual performances we see, which is something different what you do.
It's very nice to be out with a partner when things are going well, but when there is out individually, then it's tested for your full capacity as a golf.
This is the message that you want to pass on to the players, to get out of your best tomorrow.
Now, let your partner follow you and he wants to leave and get out of his best, too -
In contrast to Bjorn, the opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to play better individually than when they did as partners, with the exceptions that they Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who acquired three points from four.
Furyk itself was on both sides of those last days that could change everything, after being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before it ended losing as Europe made the Medinah Barrier.
“I remember at least a word from her,” he replied in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, master in 1999, prepared his players before the last day.
-But we have 12 important items, but you would like to take it to that start as soon as you have seen in Brooklyn, as you have seen in Medinah.
When that momentum arrives on one side, put a lot of pressure on those middle-parts.
We made our list as appropriate and put those men in the way we felt, you know, trying to do some miracles tomorrow.
Thomas had been given the task of trying to lead the fight back and facing Roy McIllroy in the best game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and other Europeans in the best half of the order.
-I went with this group of men in this way because I think it covers the whole road, - Bjorn said about his singles choices.
Germany's new war postponed again
The newest German Navali Fleet has to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War time frames, but there will not be at least next year due to systems with growing defects and costs, reported local media.
The Rheinland-Pfalz commissioning, the main ship of the new famous Baden-Wuertemberg class frigates, has now been postponed for the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The vessel had to join the Navali Fleet in 2014, but the problem issues after delivery sold the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuertemberg class vessels which ordered the Navali Fleet back in 2007 will be replaced by the old Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a strong cannon, a display of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some  Scriptural technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic synagogues.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - this should be possible to operate the newest frames up to two years away from home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that the latest technology ships - which mention allows Germany to project off-shore power - will already be old by the time they enter the service, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 bad news was seen last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navali Fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after it led.
A few were known about the reasons for this, but the German media quoted a number of key software and hardware defects made the ship useless if it was deployed on a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important as the Baden-Wuertemberg class ship will be operated by a crew of around 120 seafarers - only half of the workers on the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it appeared that the vessel has a well-weight burden which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navali Fleet to add future updates.
The ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ of 7,000 tonnes is understood to be twice more heavy than similar class vessels used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the full project price - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
This is said to have reached a shock of €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - from an initial €2.2 billion.
The problems of the newest frigates become especially important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is falling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navali Fleet currently has a failure to withstand deployment.
The official said that the problem increased over time, as old vessels were commissioned but no replacement vessels were provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuertemberg class frigates could join the Navali Fleet.
The National Trust is mentioned on the secret life of the bats tonight
New ground research in Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape when looking for food.
It is hoped that the findings will show a new light on the behaviour of single mammals flying and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipelines as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton in the Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special records will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
An expert analysis of all recordings sounds will check the frequency of bat calls tonight and what species are doing.
A habitat map will then be produced and a report will create a detailed picture of their behaviour landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats at night and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of pastures and how best to keep trees for nightbeds and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and across the United Kingdom has declined considerably over the last century.
They are under threat from building and development work affecting housing losses and losses.
Wind and light turbines can also pose a risk, as can poison paper to capture insects and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Night bats are not currently blind.
However, because of the traditions of their nottourna hunting their ears are more useful than their eyes when they come to catch the prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location techniques to indicate insects and barriers in their path when flying.
The NTS, which is responsible for the treatment of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescue.
The organisation even established the first and only reserve of Scots in the Third Land in Dumfries and Galloway, which welcomes eight of the ten species of Scotia bats.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
-Here in Threeve we have a very good area for bats tonight,” he said.
We have the old buildings, many Veteran trees and all the good habitats.
But there's much more about bats that are not yet known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.
It stresses the importance of checking nightbeats for maintenance in properties as it is possible that an unintended destruction of a single maternity nest can kill up to 400 women and young people, possibly destroying a whole local population.
Nightbeats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to fend them or to narrow them or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer for the Beast Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: -We have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we still don't know how their populations are going.
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations as soon as lawyers are ready to seek German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo pointed out rape claims against him as “false news,” saying that people must promote themselves by using his name.
His lawyers are expected to seek by court the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
Portugal's front player Juventus was accused of rapeing an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He alleged that he had paid $375,000 to not say anything about the incident, reported Der Spiegel Friday.
Speaking on a video on Instagram Live with his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, pointed out the reports as “false news”
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news, - said Ballon d'Or winner five times while he looked at the camera.
-We must promote ourselves by using my name.
It is normal.
They must become famous to say my name, but it is part of the work.
I am a happy man and everything is going well, - the player added, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to court for Der Spiegel's allegations, which they have called - inadmissible reporting of privacy suspects, - according to Reuters.
lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player seeks compensation for moral damages in an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is likely one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident was said to have taken place in June 2009 in a room in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a discote, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her from the anus, according to documents submitted to the District Court of Clark County in Nevada.
Mayorga argues that Ronaldo fell on his recovery after the alleged incident and told her that he was -99 percent - a well-dressed man - disappointed by \"one percent\"
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that both had sexual relations, but that this was by consensus.
Mayorga also argues that she went to the police and took photos of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court solution because she felt - shown by retaliation - and was concerned that she was publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old says that she is now looking to reverse the solution as she is still being traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo had come to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and this summer he went to Italian football legends Juventus in an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: UK - regrets forever - losing car manufacturers
The UK - regrets forever - if it loses its status as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
It added that it was of - concern - that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” said Mr Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of a delay at the border in the case of Brexit of no agreement would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which makes up Auris and Avensis of Toyota, produced almost 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
-My view is that if Britain exits the EU at the end of March we will see a cut in production at our factory, - said Martin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the case of Brexit of no agreements.
Toyota's production line today works on a \"perfect-time\" basis with 37-minute parts from both UK and EU suppliers for order-based cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a border disruption that industry says could lead to delays and shortcomings of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep an inventory of more than one day in its Derbyshire plant, said the company, and therefore the production would be stopped.
Mr Clark says that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is -cashed precisely to avoid these border controls -
We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal to allow, as I say, not only success to enjoy at present but for us to seize this opportunity,” he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
-The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we need to be able to complete what has been a great success set of supply chains -
Toyota could not say how long production has stopped, but in a longer period, it warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsovullaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the co-founder of the Union at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: -In my experience when these jobs leave, they never return.
A spokeswoman for the government said: -We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU -
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's dangerous meeting with the deputy attorney general Rod Rod Rosenstein could be delayed by another week - as the fight against the Supreme Court's candidate Robert Kavanaugh continued, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein handles the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's aid and Russia and a potential obstruction of justice by the president.
If Trump is going to expel the deputy general counsel or not, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, Washington's failure was prompted for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wirewear to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25 amendments.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, although there were reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, which was then the United Nations’ place in New York, which was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said that he would prefer not to expel Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid confusion with the hearing of the Senate judicial committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom gave evidence.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to carry out an investigation of claims against Kavanaugh over a period of one week, which delayed further full Senate voting.
On Sunday, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: -It has not set a date for this, it may be this week, and it may be the following week due to all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But now we see and I always love keeping the press up-to-date -
Some journalists challenge this assertion: Sanders has not organised a press meeting at the White House since 10 September.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of meetings was not due to a lack of grace with TV journalists - trying to attract and influence the audience - although she said: - although I agree with the fact that they try to attract and influence the audience.
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
-The president does more questions and answers than any agreed president, - she added that she would say without quoting any evidence: -Look at those numbers.
The meetings will still be held, said Sanders, but - if the press is able to ask questions directly to the US president, this is far better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this a lot and have seen us do this many times in the last few weeks and this will replace the press meeting where one can speak to the president of the United States.
Trump rarely answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting the honoraries.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he behaves relaxedly and sometimes strangely in front of groups of journalists.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland on Brexit-related fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the gratitude and desire of the country that they remain behind Brexit.
Jane Freeman MSP sent a letter when less than six months left for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to entering into the cost of defined status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: - Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue continued, moving towards decisions expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government was also increasing its preparations for a possible scenario of no agreement.
I know that this is certainly a unstable time for you all.
That is why I wanted to support now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and are beneficial to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here -
Christion Abercromie does Emergency Surgery After suffering a Rasu
Tennissee State Tigers' linebacker Christion Abercromie carried out emergency surgery after suffering a Saturday-headed injury when his team lost against the Vanderbilt Comfortores by 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The main coach of the state of Tennessee Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time.
He went on the sideline and like he fell there,” said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing it on a strecer and taking it back for further examination.
A Tennissee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was no longer operating at Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that there is still no detail on the type/extreme of the injury - and the Tennissee State is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in the second year of the suspended university, is in his first season with the State of Tennissee after leaving Illinois.
On Saturday he had five pickles before he left the game, which led to the total of 18 pickle of his season.
Foreign buyers will be required to pay more tax on stamp when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be required to pay more tax when buying property in the UK with extra money used to help homeless people under new Tory plans
This change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in stamp tax will be imposed on non-tax payers in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects it to rise up to £120 million a year - to help people without a home
Today Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers should pay a higher rate of stamp tax when buying property in the UK - with extra money used to help homeless people.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and target high-payers.
The increase in stamp tax will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay tax in the UK, with extra money boosting Government efforts to fight road sleep.
The additional payment - which is additional to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second houses and rental purchases - may be three per cent.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to £120 million per year.
Around 13 per cent of the new properties built in London are purchased by non-UK residents, increasing prices and thus making it more difficult for new buyers to make a first step in the accommodation purchase phases.
Many rich areas of the country - in particular in the capital city - have become - fantastic cities - due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time abroad.
The new policy was issued only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax reduction of the stamp to help us buy their first home.
It accused large construction firms that were holding high property prices by taking and not using land, and urged Ms May to abandon allowances on affordable housing in order to correct the situation of housing bans in the UK.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed accommodation reforms affecting the eye, including rent checks and the end of expulsions - without any fault -
It also wants to give the councils great powers to build new houses.
Ms May said: - Last year I said that I will devote my position to restoring the dream of the UK - that life should be better for every new generation.
And this means we arrange the broken market of our accommodation.
The UK will always remain open to people who want to live, work and bring their lives here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies find it easy to buy homes as much as the United Kingdom's home residents.
For many people the dream of having a home has become too far away, and the dignity of sleeping on the streets remains very real -
Jack Ross: -My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland -
The head of Sanderland Jack Ross says that his \"fundamental ambition\" is to once become the manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scotsman welcomes the challenge of restoring the North-East club, currently in third place in the League One, with three points different from that in the first place.
This summer he moved to St Mirren's Stadium after guiding St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership in the last season.
I wanted to play for countries as a player.
I found B cap and nothing more, - Ross told Sportsound of the BBC of Scotland.
-But when I was still a child I often went with my father to watch Scotland play in Hammpden, and it always remains the thing that pulled me back.
However, this opportunity will only come if I succeed in managing a club -
The former Ross as manager of Sanderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says that he did not worry about the fact that he would follow such established names in such a large club, while previously rejecting the offer from the City of Barnsley and Ipswich.
-As of now, will success be based on - can I re-lead this club to the Premier League?
Due to the structure and facilities of this club there is no doubt that this club belongs to the Premier League, he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I probably think I’ve been successful here only if I’m able to take the club back there”
Ross has been only three years in his career as manager, after a period of assistant head in Dumbarton and having spent 15 months with Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from the racers for the third category, transforming St Mirren from the edge of the racers to winners of the championship title the following season.
And Ross says that now he is more comfortable than he was feeling during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
With regard to taking Alloa in his hands, he recalled that - this was probably a major change -
-I thought the post of manager was the most suitable for me, much more than that of a player.
This could be strange as I was going well, I had a decent living, and I enjoyed some reasonable achievements.
But games can be difficult.
There are many things you need to do every week.
Still I still experience this in terms of stress and work pressure but simply feel that the post of manager is suitable for me.

Survey finds that the best time to take a beer pin is at 5.30pm of evening
The summer heat wave boosted the profits of UK pubs in difficulty but put more pressure on the restaurants of the same company.
In July, groups of pubs and bars saw a 2.7 per cent increase in sales - but figures revealed that the return on restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business advisory CGA, who collected figures, said: -A continuous Sun and the longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar model for the previous month of June, when sales in dobs increased by 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were affected even more.
The decrease of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trade in June continued to worsen in July.
The pubs and bars whose main sales are drinks were those that went most well in terms of financial results compared to the previous period while the sales of restaurants decreased.
The dolls whose main sale is food have also suffered in heat, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to drink.
In dolls and bars managed drinking sales increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food fell to three per cent -
Paul Newman, one of RSM's analysts on entertainment and hospitality, said: -These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors as regards the sale on the take-away market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent year after year will be particularly burdensome in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The hot and long summer could not be worse for operators whose main sales are only food and time can only advise whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the necessary rest.
The growth of total sales in pubs and restaurants, including the opening of new businesses, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowing of start-ups.
The monitoring of the sales of the Coffer Peach Tracker industry for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses the performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined revenue of more than £9 billion, and is the industry's established benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts hiding from their parents

News has great fears that sexual content is being displaced
Twenty percent of students said they had a key account to show their parents
One in five children - some of whom are under the age of 11 - are creating social media accounts hiding from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed rapid growth in Insta's accounts - a reference to Instagram's photo sharing site.
The news has great fears that sexual content is being displaced.
Twenty percent of students said they operated a key account - presentable - to show their parents, while having private ones.
A mother who met the secret site of her 13-year-old child found a young woman who was urging others to accompany her - -storu me -
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters - and Headmedians - Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of young people aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half admitted to holding private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchan said: -It's worrying that many young people are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them -
Eilidh Doyle will become the voice for athletes on the Scottish Athletic Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletic Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most protagonist of the course and not of the course that won most medals and President Ian Beattie described this change as a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from its vast experience at international level over the last decade.
-Elidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and world Athletic community and we are sure that the Atletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by becoming part of the board,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: -I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead sport in Scotland.
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Games in Atlanta, among its total of four Olympic Games gold medals and which is now a regular BBC critic, ended up having a small stroke.
On Twitter he wrote: “As a month ago, you gave me a stroke.
I couldn’t move.
Doctors have said that only time can advise whether or not I recover.
It was hard work but I completely recovered, I learned how to re-create and today I am doing agility exercises!

Advertisement of the breast pump comparing mothers to cattle gives rise to different online opinions
A breast pump company has given rise to different online opinions with an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers with pregnant cattle.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered to be the first breast pump in the world to be wearable and non-noise, consumer technology company Elvie has issued an ad inspired by an iron music video to show the freedom of the new pump to give mothers using the breast pump.
Four real mothers dance in a mammura full of cattle's straw with a disc including alica such as: -Yes, I'm milking myself but I don't have a tail - and - If I don't have these, they're not a peas but a chest.
The corus goes on: -Pump out, pump out, I'm sleeping my babies, pumping out, pumping out, I'm milking my women -
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page caused an online debate.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, the video received different reactions from viewers, many of which say it sheds light on the \"terror\" of the dairy industry.
Someone wrote - It was a very bad decision that cattle were used to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and pregnant in order to produce milk, except that their babies are taken within a few days of birth.

Someone else commented: -One understands that this is a traumatic thing for both the mother and the baby.
But yes why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers to keep their babies?
Someone else added: “I’m really cut off from reality.”
Others have defended the ad, with a woman admitted that she found the disc very fun.
-I think this is a genetic idea.
If I were still breast-feeding, I would buy one.
Pumping made me feel the same way as a cow.
Advertisement is a little or too wonderful but I have taken it of him.
This is a genetic product, written by someone.
Someone else commented: -This is a fun ad targeting mothers who pump (often on their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like \"cows\"
This is not an advertising praising or judging the milk industry -
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they were all bleeding with non-eye pumps placed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump, does not make any noise, has no wire or tube and sits in a breast-feeding bra without giving in to the eye, thus giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even come out while they are pumping.
Ana Balrin, partner and ECD in Mother commented: -The Elvie Pump is a so revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing women using the breast pump with the dairy cow, we wanted to focus on breast pumping and all the challenges it brings, while showing fun and related to it, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump appeared on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the catwalk for designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Go Free of Speech to a Tend camp at the border of Texas
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply despite the fact that the monthly border crossing has not changed too much, in part because historical and harsh policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it more difficult to put children with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and feared that if they presented themselves to take care of a child they would endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their customs would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement officer, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
Almost 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the home of sponsors are here in the country illegally, many of whom are foreign criminals.
We are therefore continuing to seek these individuals, Mr Albence said.
In order to make the process involving children faster, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the workers of the helmets.
Many will appear through a video telephony conference, instead of personally, to bring arguments in favour of their case for legal status to a immigration judge.
Those considered ineligible for aid will be deported immediately.
According to selter workers and reports that emerged from the system in recent months, the more children are kept under custody, the more likely they become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent expressions or attempts to escape.
The lawyers said that these concerns would increase in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where it is more likely to ignore signs that a child is finding it difficult, due to the size of the facility.
They added that the movement of children to the city of tents without being given enough time to prepare emotionally or without telling their partners can lead to trauma many of them are already fighting.
Syria tells the U.S., France and Turkey ‘occupational forces’ to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as a deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were on the Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of the fight against terrorism, and will be properly addressed.
-They should withdraw immediately and unconditionally, - told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war against terrorism almost ended” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions moving from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight this sacred battle until they have been expelled from all Syrian territories - both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence -
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, many of which have trained and advised both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the country destroyed by war.
With regard to the refugee issue, Moualem said that the conditions were right for them to return, and pointed - in some Western countries - for spreading irregular fears - that led refugees to stay away.
-We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return,” he said.
(They are politicising what should be a purely human issue)
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition in order to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last powerful major rebel has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had clear deadlines and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists including the fighters from the Al-Qaida-related Nusra Front, which will be destroyed.
UN envoys Staffan de Mistura is hoping to shortly convene the first new committee meetings composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be restricted - to the revision of the articles of the current constitution - and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Second Order
With this logic, Mr Trump will win the re-election in 2020 provided that, as many liberal viewers are hoping, the return and the scandal end its presidency earlier.
What is without a doubt the most dramatic finale that has ever been in the presidency!”
So far, it seems that viewers have not yet looked like.
Since 2014, time ratings with the largest number of viewers have increased by more than double to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in time with the largest number of viewers, more than 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Madow Show has increased cable TV ratings with even 3.5 million viewers on main news nights.
-This is a situation that attracts people to it because it is not something to understand, - said Neal Baer, a presenter of the ABC drama program, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, writer of Veteran comedy and author of Just the Funy Parts: And a Five Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys - Club, has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote to Mr Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, “Because I’m sorry,” she told me Mrs. Scovell.
In this case there is an entertainment value.
Without a doubt, unlike anything else on TV, stories from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can re-unite and the health of the global economy.
To ignore what is happening around you is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And however, this goes beyond being an informed citizen when in the sixth you find yourself following a panel of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward's sourceing - with a deep background - for his book -Fear, - the bomber jacket with the skin of the snow ( - a proud mirror, - said Paul Manafort's Washington Post) with a value of $15,000 and the implications of Mr Trump's anatomical descriptions by Stormy Daniel.
I, for example, will never look back at Super Mario in the same way.
A part of what he is doing makes it as if this is reality show is that every night is leading something,” said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of Pawn Stars, about the changing cast and the development in the daily plot of the Trump programme (fighting with the N.F.L., commends Kim Jong-un).
You cannot afford to lose one episode because you otherwise fall back.
When I contacted Mr Fleiss this week, out of the house the weather was solar at a temperature of 80 degrees on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching the MSNBC while recording the CNN.
He could not get out of front of television, not when there was a Kavanaugh Brett ready to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in a dangerous situation.
-I remember when we had previously made those exciting programmes and people said, -This is the beginning of the end of Western civilisation, - said Mr Fleiss.
-I thought she was a joke, but in truth they were right.

Large amounts of money coming from the outside to the strictest race in the White House mid-term election
It is not surprising that the 17 contemporaneous districts of Pennsylvania are seeing a large amount of money, thanks to a realignment of contemporaneous districts that have acquired two operators in a race for the same seat.
It has recently re-established the pits of Pittsburg suburban district the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is issuing as a candidate against another operator, the Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the 12 old provinces of Pennsylvania, which extend heavily to the 17 new districts.
The maps were re-established after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts were imprisoned in an anti-constitutional manner in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the seventeen new districts provided a difficult competition for the financial campaign between the main party's finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after winning with a slight difference in the March special election followed by a great deal for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That seat was Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political critics gave Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered penalising El Salvador to support China, then decided not to do so
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little help from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump held a welcoming meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and had a hotel in Panama until some partners expelled the Trump Organisation's administrative team.
Officials of the State Department decided to re-contact US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan, - said the speakers of the Heather Nauert department, in a statement at the beginning of this month.
But the penalties were considered only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received around $140 million in US aid, including narcotic controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be burdensome for the Central American country and its high unemployment and killing rates.
As internal meetings started to progress, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year which was considered a step forward in efforts not to go to the United States.
But by mid-September, the officials of the highest administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with the aim of effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence was strongly criticized to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance of the administration being placed on the meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three American sent back quietly back in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new or tough messages or punishment from Washington.
A White House speaker, Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were supported by a foreign analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
History study
The next unexpected adverse event could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible disruption of justice by Mr Trump, on which there is now very substantial evidence in the public register.
It is reported that Mr Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr Trump's campaign was agreed with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In the event that the Congress moves to another person, Mr Trump will find himself responsible in that body, as he prepares to go back to the voters, and perhaps a jury of his peers.
This involves a lot of uncertainties, and I do not have the aim to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalent in Europe.
There are options from which all of them should be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the fight.
In 1938, the German officials were willing to perform a cop d'état against Hitler, if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We did not succeed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the following years of massage.
The course of history revolves with such inflation points, and the inexhaustible march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Today, Americans face many of these inflation points.
What will we do if Mr Trump expels Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this document reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be recorded in secret and that he is not fit for office.
Mr Rosenstein said that the Times report was inaccurate.
-How will we answer whether the F.B.I.'s new claim of Bert Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair - or whether it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual conduct and unfair evidence?
And above all, in the middle of the terms we will vote for Congress that will keep Mr Trump responsible?
If we do not pass these tests, it will take time to move in democracy.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
Mother was a Czech Jewish who was deported to Auschwitz from the same Nazi regime that once occupied the house of my ambassadors.
She managed to live, migrate to America and, 60 years later, on the day of God's worship, sent me to light the candles on that table with swastics.
With such an heritage, how can I not be an optimistic about our future? -

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is found optimistic before the competitive game with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with the knowledge that the victory against Austrians, following the equally impressive result they brought in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League G Group.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the equal result of 2-2 with Villarreal but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a catalyst for big things.
-This was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good team, - said the 31-year-old.
-We came to the game with the belief that we could get something and we went with a point.
We were likely able to win her last but, in everything, an equal result was probably a fair result.
Probably they were better in the first half of the game while we went better in the second half.
Thursday will again be a great European night.
We hope we can get three points but this will be difficult because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can continue to do our best and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, between all that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but there is still a sense of positiveness.
The team is good and boys are having a lot of fun; training is being good.
I hope we can now do our best, forget the last season and succeed -
Women are worried about this concern related to retirement savings
Despite the fact that respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, a few people were talking to their family members about it.
Around half of the individuals in the Nationalwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they spoke to their children about it.
People want to be a family member who cares, but they do not take steps to make a conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide life insurance business.
You should start this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes well before time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as those options can be a significant factor to determine the cost.
Get your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid money-value life insurance policy to help cover these costs or make self-insurance with your own wealth - provided you have the money.
Take a decision after discussing your long-term legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Find a healthcare proxy to choose a reliable individual to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
In addition, consider a proxy for your finances.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your accounts are paid if you are unable.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
-Not only are the finances involved, but who are the doctors? - said Martin.
-What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that that plan is ready -

Officials described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a random act.
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries do not threaten his life and the police have called for witnesses.
Termots and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a earthquake and a severe tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, officials said, with the number of deaths expected to increase.
In the light of the above, the Commission considers that the aid is not compatible with the internal market and that it does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
These are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, about the island of Solawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Solawesi, located at the edge of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Solawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit the city, it was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a sight that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of the coast in the north-west of the island of Solawesi.
Reliance, an administrative region under province, had a population of around 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the economy of the central province of Solawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mine is also important in the province, but it is concentrated mainly on Moreal, on the coast of the other side of Solawesi.
According to Indonesia's Desaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, tsunami also hit the western side of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Semitic Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a large earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province on the upper side of Sumatra stoked a tsunami that hit 14 countries, which killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-strong earthquake hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-strong earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital city of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-mile earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, beyond Sumatra, which struck a tsunami with a height of 10 metres which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low earthquake hit Pidie Jaya's renaissance in Aceh, which caused destruction and panic as people remembered the tragedy of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunamis were hit, but more than 100 were killed because of a building that had been damaged.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombrok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the top of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of temporarily isolated tourists.
The largest boy of Sarah Palin arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the largest son of the former Governor of Alaska and presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault charges.
29-year-old Palin, from Wesila, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, who interfered in a report of domestic violence and who resisted the arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when female knowledgeers tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone off her hand.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su Primial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, report the KTU.
He appeared to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself - indeed, not guilty - when he was asked to give his plea, reported the network.
Palin is facing three Class A crimes, i.e. he can stay in prison for up to a year and has to pay a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of a Class B crime, which is punishable with a day of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges against Palin have been made.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called on the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veteran Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of a domestic attack, which interfered with the domestic violence crime report, and held a weapon in his possession while he was in prison in connection with the incident.
His girl claimed to have thrown her at her face suddenly.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by the veterinary groups following a comparison between the violent behaviour of her child and the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Terremot and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after a earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Solawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with a force of 7.5 tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not working with the number of expected deaths to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit only a few out of the centre of Solawesi located in the north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jacobr.
The media are circulating videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach with great force.
Federal prosecutors are demanding that NYC's terrorist attack suspect be given a rare death penalty
The federal prosecutors in New York are demanding that Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of terrorist attack in the city of New York, who has killed eight people, be sentenced to death - a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, allegedly used a home Depot rental truck to carry out a road attack along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, as in October he carried out a trip to the pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov - intentionally - killed the eight victims and - intentionally - caused serious physical injuries, according to a notice on the intention to request the death penalty, presented in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, these two heads of the charge bear a possible death penalty.
Two weeks after the attack, a federal jury gave Saipov 22 heads of charge including eight allegations of organised rescue-aid murder, typically used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
When describing the way Saipov carried out this attack, the prosecutors said that the attack needed substantial planning and premeditation.
Notice on intention that Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Aljeandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York that has persecuted a case of death.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being found guilty of conspiracy to carry out a expedition to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed by the electricity chair on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, has shown a lack of remordes in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, told the police.
Saipov told the authorities he urged to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the head of the charge.
He also called for his hospital room to be flagged by ISIS, saying the police.
He replied not guilty to the 22 heads of the charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were, in fact, disappointed by the decision to prosecute.
-We think that the decision to request the death penalty instead of accepting a plea for imprisonment with no possibility of release will only continue to prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defence team previously asked prosecutors not to request the death penalty.
MP Tory says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Miguel Farage has promised to mobilise the people's army.
The former head of Ukip said that politicians had to feel under pressure - from Euroxeptics - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Government member Peter Bone told the demonstration in Birmingham that until now the UK would have emerged - that Mr Farage would have been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Ms May to reconcile her highly divided positions has been highlighted by Tories, which is not in favour of Brexit, who joined a separate protester against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on the right track among attacks by Brexit, against Brexit and the EU.
Allies insisted that despite the negative reaction, it would continue to move forward to try to reach an agreement with Brussels - and force Euroxeptics and Labour parties to choose between its package and the Caos.
Mr Bone told allly Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to remove Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been given a high social position and that responsibility be given to the negotiations with Brussels.
-If he were responsible, we would have so far, - he said.
MP Wellingborough added: -I will defend Brexit but we need to remove Chequers' plan.
When he declared it to be against the EU, he said: -We do not fight world wars to serve me.
We must make our own laws in our own country -
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed from the 2016 vote: -The idea that the British people have changed their mind and must remain not absolutely true -
Andrea Jenkyns, Brexitera of Tory, was also present for the demonstration, telling reporters: -I want to simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the Opposition will not vote for it, not popular with our party and with our activists who are actually going to the streets and who first vote for us.
Please forget the Chequers plan and start listening
In a message targeting Ms May, she said: -The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when keeping their promises -
Mr Farage told everyone that politicians should feel under pressure - that they would return from the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
-This is now a matter of trust between us - people - and our political class, - he said.
-They are trying to go back from Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not let you smooth if you do it.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he said: -I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is at the point of going back from Brexit.
We are mobilizing in Brexit the people's army of this country that has brought us success and will not spend until we have become an independent, self-governmental and proud UK.
Meanwhile, those against Brexit moved to Birmingham before doing a two-hour rest in the city centre.
Following the group's launch of this weekend, a small number of activists waved banners in the writing of Tories Against Brexit (Tories Against Brexit).
Lord Adonis, who has a high social position in the Labour Party, has made a joke to the Conservatives for security issues that have suffered from a party's app as soon as the conference was opened.
-These are people who tell us that they can have all the IT systems in place and technology for Canada and more, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland, - he added.
-This is a whole butterfly.
The idea of a good Brexit does not exist, he added.
Warren intends to examine carefully the possibility of issuing for the presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, he will carefully examine the possibility of going to the presidential election.
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the member of the Massachusetts Democratic Party spoke about its future in a debate with citizens at municipal level in West Massachusetts.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for a re-election in November against the GOP Geoff Diahl State Representative, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was at the centre of speculation which could replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with constituents who have long used the format of a debate with citizens at municipal level since Trump took office.
A person who attended the meeting asked her whether she intended to run for the presidential election.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to repair our fragmented government, including a woman at the top.
LSU Semi-fired killing in connection with the killing of LSU
On Saturday, the police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect was arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Ruge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. News Conference ET.
Friday they released a shooting video, asking for help to identify the man appearing in the video.
Sims, a 20-year-old, was killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
According to 247sports, on Saturday police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media -Wayde Sims suffered from a rash wound and eventually died as a result.
Wayde came to defend his partner and was hit by a plane from Simpson.
Simpson was asked questions and admitted that he was on the scene, who had a weapon, and admitted to shooting on Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and kept under custody in the Police Department of Parish Baton Ruge of the East.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches to get the world title after his team's orders gave him victory against Sebastian Vettel
Saturday, from the moment Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes's orders would have an important part in the race.
From the inside position in the first row, Buttas had a good advantage and almost abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel was the first to enter the stop areas and allowed Hamilton to leave with others at the last place of the group, something that had to be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in the stop area after another turn and left immediately after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to move after a few wheel action with a wheel that led to the Ferrari driver's difficulty leaving the inside free due to the risk of falling back after a double move to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the rear row of the grid and was in seventh place until the end of the first round at the age of 21.
He then led the majority of the race by not changing his tyres with the aim of quickly completing and exceeding Kimi Rakonen for fourth place.
He eventually entered the stop zone in 44 turns but could not increase his pace in the remaining eight turns while Raikonen entered fourth place.
It is a difficult day because Valteri did his job very well throughout the week and it was a true gentlom saying let me by.
The team did a really exceptional job to get first and second place, - said Hamilton.
What was a Physical Approach Really Bad
President Donald Trump set out to shame Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday in connection with her insistentness that she did not find the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the nominated person of the Supreme Court of Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When speaking at a general meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the evidence given by Ford before the Senate Senate of the Judicial Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were -viol and unjust and not sincere.
-The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and violent and desperate and not sincere, he said.
-When you look at statements and disclosures and then say no, I did not.
I didn’t do it.
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you find any information?
Remember her answer... I discovered the document - -e, e, what is it?
No see.
I did not reveal anything -
See, wait a minute.
We discovered... No, we did not reveal, - he added, while imitating the Senator.
Feinstein you sent her the letter giving details of the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was revealed earlier in September - but Feinstein refused to reveal it came from her office.
-I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not reveal her story, - Feinstein told the committee, the Hill reported.
-She asked me to keep her confidential and I kept her confidential as she asked -
But it seems that her rejection was not well received by the president, who during Saturday morning’s ally commented: “I know what I know, that that was a really bad physical attitude.
It may not have looked, but what is the worst physical behaviour you've ever seen -
While continuing his defence of the nominated person of the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three people, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their purposes.
They are determined to take back power by any necessary means.
They do not care about those who hurt, those who make the sticks in the wheels to gain power and control, - the president said according to reports from Mediaitis.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer twice dark for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for the loss of the Elite League of Week against Belfast Giants by winning the game against the same 5-3 opponent in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants gained an advantage of two early goals in the game with two attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beavullier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney brought the same score for the team playing in his country before Dwyer gained another advantage for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard obtained the same score for Dundee before two goals of Lucas Lundvald Nielsen confirmed their victory.
This was Adam Keefe's third season win for players in Elite League, who later advanced several losses to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
This was the fourth time this season these two teams met, with Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal took place in the fourth minute at 3:35 at a pace from Kendall McFaul, with David Rutherford giving the step while Beavullier doubled the advantage four minutes later.
In what was a multi-action opening period, Sullivan brought back the team playing in his country back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt took a step to Cowney at 15:16, which brought the same score to both teams.
Dwyer sure that Giants get an advantage up to the first advantage of the game when he made his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The team playing in his country was re-united and again thanks to Bouchard again they met the other team with a strong goal at 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran joined to help Nielsen give Dundee an advantage for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and assured the 5-go win for his team in the middle of the last period.
Giants, now losing four of their last five games, will play in their country against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Die to ensure that hundreds of people on the aircraft can escape from the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died to ensure that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people is able to land safely.
More than 800 people died and many were lost after a large earthquake hit the island of Solawesi on Friday, which started a tsunami.
Strong increases continued to control the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
However, although his colleagues fled to save, the 21-year-old Anthonius Guanwan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower he was running at Paulu Airport, Mutara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
It remained calm to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which at the time was located in the runway, could safely leave.
He then exceeded the traffic control tower when he thought it was carrying.
He died later in hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that the decision was likely to save hundreds of lives, reported Australia's ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he left us this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“When we hear about it, we feel a great deal of joy,” he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency says that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
-It is estimated that the number is still rising because many bodies were still under the crushing while many could not be reached, - said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves of up to six metres have destroyed Paul in which Sunday will become a mass burial.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Lisa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: -Every minute the ambulance entered the body.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being stolen everywhere -
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: -The Red Cross of Indonesia is working hard to help those who are still alive but we don't know what to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse -
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country's military: -I am asking you all to work night and day to complete any evacuation-related task.
Are you ready? - report CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Incident of an aircraft in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is lost after the aircraft accident in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight that took place in the Pacific Laguna in Micronesia now says that a man is lost, after saying previously that the 47 passengers and crew members had safely fled from the aircraft he was burning.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, she was unable to give details about where one man’s passenger was.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local boats helped save passengers and other crew members after the aircraft hit the water when he tried to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The officials said on Friday that seven of the people were hospitalized.
The airline said that six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in a stable condition.
What caused the incident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the US Navy both said that the land aircraft in the lagoon was slightly away from the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the aircraft exceeded the runway.
The American passenger Bill Janes said that the aircraft entered very low.
-This is a really good thing,” said Jaynes.
Janes said that he and others managed to pass through the water that was high to their waist until the emergency exit on the plane that was burning.
He said that flight assistants were panicking and shouting, and that he suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that the seafarers working closely to improve the cane also helped save by using an inflatable boat to carry passengers to the shore before the aircraft was burned at about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Date from Aviation Safety Network indicates that in the last two decades 111 people have died in PNG registered airline accidents but no incident involved Air Niugini.
Analyst presents a day's schedule in which a woman has been burned alive
On Saturday the prosecution concluded its evidence on the case in the new process of a man who is accused of burning a woman from Mississippi while she was alive.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett has shown for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described for the jury how he used the mobile records to gather information on the movements of defendant Quinton Tellis 29 year old and the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19 years old, on the night he died.
Roulette said that he received localisation data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers that night that he died, contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the mobile data showed that he was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford spoke Saturday and testified that he was not in town on that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that that night was on Sanford's truck, Sanford said that he was - he was lying, since my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers for two weeks when he died.
Mobile records indicated that they only knew each other a week.
Roullett said that shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted the messages, calls and contact information of Chambers from his mobile phone.
He removed her from his life,” said Hale.
The defence is scheduled to start its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the process to pass on to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
Three hip-hop artists must challenge the negative gender perspective by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, by Bristol, claims that the hip hop has gone beyond its origin of political messages and is addressing social issues.
They want to go back to his roots and again make the pop a popular awareness.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have seen a recent rise in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nancy from NY chases a couple for removing her after a message-razist
Nancy from New York is chasing a couple for discriminatory expulsion after she received an incorrect message from her mother complaining she was another black person.
The couple deny that they are racist, and compare the case with the \"extortion\"
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed regret when she learned that the new child-career, Giselle Maurice, had been a dark-wave on arrival for the first working day in 2016.
-LEEEEEEEE OTHER NEW PERSUNA, - Ms Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a letter to her husband.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Ms Maurice, twice.
After noting her thick mistake, Plasco-Flaxman felt uncomfortable and dismissed Ms. Maurice, who said that her former African-American grandmother did not do her job well and that instead she was waiting for Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for her single working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is pushing the couple for compensation in respect of the dismissal, and seeks compensation of $350 a day for the six-month live-in position for which she was initially employed, although without a contract.
I want to show them, listen, I can't do such things, - said to the Post on Friday, while adding -I know this is discrimination -
The couple attacked the statements that they were racist, saying that Ms. Maurice's expulsion was the most reasonable thing they could do, fearing they could not trust her after they offered her.
-Arti sent her something that she did not intend to say.
She is not racist.
We are not racist people, - said Joel Plasco to a place.
-But would you trust your children in the hands of someone who spoke to you softly, even if it was wrong?
Your newborn baby?
And let's go
When comparing the case with the \"extortion\" - Plasco said that it had been only two months since his wife had had had her baby and was located - in a very difficult situation -
You’ll accuse someone like that?
It's not a nice thing to do, - added the investment banker.
While the legal case is ongoing, the court of public opinion has quickly announced to the couple on social media, where it has consulted them for their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers would not have related to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: -It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who is reading it for the first time before it was published.
-It's really fun to know now what we know about Paddington's great success.
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC camera before he was inspired to write the book of children from a small game bear, would certainly have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was a pleasant but somewhat sad one after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as a very important member of our family, she added that her father was proud of his eventual success although he was never going to talk about him.
He was quite a quiet man, and he was not filled with it himself,” she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child to get something: be proud of them even if it wasn’t you who got something.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in that way.
Although he was his creation and imagination, he always gave the merit to Paddington himself -
My daughter was dying and I had to give her last love on the phone
Once her daughter was immediately taken to Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors worked to save her life but it was nothing.
-Nad was calling regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, which was not expected to live, - said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I received a call from Nad to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to give her the last peace.
And so I did.
Tell her,”Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines doctors gave her to keep her heart beat were falling and leaving her system slowly.
She had died some of the time before and started to cross everything.
All I could do was sit down and wait, aware that all this is happening.
I could not cry or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold back really -
Eventually Ms Ednan-Laperouse, who has so far been crying for the loss of her daughter, took over on the plane along with the other passengers - who did not know the difficult situation from which she was going.
“No one knew,” she said.
-I had a low head, and tears began to fall all the time.
I have difficulty explaining, but there was on the flight that I felt a great sense of sympathy to Nad.
That he needed my love and love.
I knew how much he loved her.
Post cards of distressed women to avoid suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost a loved one because of suicide are working to prevent others from getting rid of themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were fixing cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and telephone numbers that people could call for support.
Tyler, Mrs Davis' son, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
-I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day, - she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
-Everyone knew for his own smile.
They always had to say that his smile had turned on every room -
However, he had to stop at work before he died, because he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Brother Tyler, then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had killed himself.
Ms Davis said: -I'm always afraid that this will be the cause of another terrible event -
Ms Davis created the cards, -in order to inform people who can open your heart or meet you, even as a friend.
Do not put in silence - you need to talk -
Ms Humphreys, who has been a friend to Ms Davis for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not too long after his mother's death.
He did not say that he was feeling bad or depressed or so,” she said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day it was very bad - when the children opened their gifts he made no contact with them with his eyes or something so -
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they wanted to fight her: - Leave a family void.
We are separated.
But all of us want to continue with our lives and fight -

As a result, the FBI has not been able to provide any evidence that the FBI would not be able to provide any evidence that the FBI would not be able to provide any evidence of the existence of an anti-dumping duty.
-I said, if we could get something like what he asked for - a limited investigation in time, limited in scope - maybe we would have brought a few units, - Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was being carried out among a party paralyses who had raised the roots.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reaction is due in full to the time option.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November - if, as expected, the Republicans do not go well, in that case they will be severely weakened in their attempts to put the man they want to be elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was taking the phone to call the Senators, to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Mr Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, currently occupying 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which allows Mike Pence, the vice-president, to vote and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea under Kim
The number of North Korea's reserves for South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, said South Korea's legislator.
When quoting a date from the ministry for the reunification of the South, Park Byeong-seug, said last year there were 1,127 changes in the party - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates demanded by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comment.
The vast majority of deserters on the northern side would inevitably be offered citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Many of them escape by passing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the very protected DMZ between the two parts of Korea.
China considers settlers to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their country by force.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still in war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the stagnating of denuclearisation negotiations.
This took place after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards the Korean nuclear-risk-free peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Young-ho was put in U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress made since then.
Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, we will in no way be the first to remove weapons unilaterally,” said Mr Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Robert Kavanaugh -steric, - while saying he is unable to work in the Supreme Court
The Leaders of a minority of the House Nancy Pelosi called on the person nominated for the Supreme Court Mr. Bert Kavanaugh-sterical - and said he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because of his temporal behaviour.
Pellosi made these comments at an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
-I couldn't think that if a woman had ever acted in that way, they would say -sterical, - Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness before the Judicial Committee of the Holy See on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they both were still young.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even crying and crying when he was talking about his family and his secondary school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him - an analysis of the grotesque and coordinated character - organised by the liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pellosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's witnesses proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he had prejudices against Democrats.
-I think he qualifys himself with those statements and the way he went after Clintons and Democrats, - she said.
Pelosi moved when asked whether she would try to accuse Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if Democrats achieve the majority in the House of Representatives.
-I will say something -- if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, therefore he is not able, not only to be in the Supreme Court, but even to be in the court in which he is currently, - said Pelosi.
Currently Kavanaugh is a judge at the Court of Appeal of D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered conservative justice.
In his confirmatory hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would change certain Supreme Court decisions.
-It is not appropriate for a person with sterilistic prejudice to go to court and wait to say, - very good, - said Pelosi.
And Women Need to Exercise Their Authority.
It is a fair verbal attack, months and years filled with anger, and she cannot say what she should say without crying.
-We cry when we grow up, - I said rich Steinem 45 years later.
“I don’t think this is a rare thing, what do you say?”
She added, “I’ve enjoyed a lot of a woman who was there somewhere, who said that even she was crying when she was raised, but developed a technique that meant that when she grew up and began to cry, she told the person she was talking to,” likely thinking that she was sad because she was crying.
I'm raised -
And then it did not stop.
And I thought that was something brilliant -
Cry is allowed as a way to release its great anger in part because they are fundamentally incorrectly interpreted.
One of my most clear memories of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, where I once found myself crying with indescribable anger, was when a older woman took me from my neck thigh - a cool manager I was always afraid of - and carried me to the stairs.
“Never let them see you crying,” I said.
They do not know that you are raised up.
They think that you are sad and feel happy that they have been able to hurt you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Democratic Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was going to run for a presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in a relationship outside the marriage on a boat known as Monkey Business and emerged from the election, Ms Schroeder, very raised, concluded that there was no reason why she did not explore the idea of going out for the presidential election itself.
-This was not a well-thought-out decision, - I said with a smile 30 years later.
-There were already seven other candidates who were going to run for election, and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called it “Snow White and Seven Nani”
Since this was at the end of the campaign, she was behind the collection of funds, so she would not go to the election if she did not make $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her fans who would have given $1,000 to men would have given her only $250.
“These people think that I’m going to take a discount?” she said.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so emotional - grateful to the people who supported her, raised her with the system that made her so difficult to raise funds and to target voters instead of delegates, and raised to sex - that it was created.
-I probably thought I had these strong brakes, - Ms Schroeder recalled how the media reacted to her.
You thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will you write about my grave?

How the US-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The number of U.S.-China start-up air bombs were burning you, and while the battle remained to end, misunderstandings between countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, gave the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exporters including solar panels, iron and aluminium.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting goods amounting to $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing is retalised each time in the same way, while more recently it has presented five to ten percent tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to agree with the US every time, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy of the world will surrender in the near future.
The fact that Washington takes a step back means that it accepts the requests, but publicly the fact that China surrenders to the US will be too embarrassing for some Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing works wisely, US trade war pressures can support China in a long-term positive way by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
-The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that start economic chaos in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than those previously recognised, said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a reflection group.
Syria is ready to return refugees, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a seven-year war.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Mualem said that the conditions in the country were improving.
-Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees in the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime welcomes aid to rebuild the destroyed country.
But it stressed that it will not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that have sponsored the settlement.
Europe celebrates Ryder Cup win in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup against Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times in European land and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.

American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against the lowest level player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest-level player, Dustin Johnson, brought 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who played in his final Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergeia became the best ever European tournament player with 25.5 points throughout his career.
-I usually don’t cry but today I can’t keep it.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas who chose me and who believed in me.
I am very happy, very happy that I got back the cup.
The team is everything, and I'm glad I could help, - said Garcia emotionted after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his committed partner John Ram who won to the legend of the US Gulf Tierr Woods 2&1 in singles play Sunday.
-The incredible pride that I feel, which I won Tiger Woods, when I grew up to follow him, said a 23-year-old rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of Ryder Cup 13-21-3 throughout his career.
Strange statistics of one of the best players ever, winning 14 main titles, the second after Jack Nicklaus only.
Team USA beat the whole weekend to find those parts of the golf course with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
US Captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his team, -I'm proud of these men, they fight.
There was a time this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We've been here for a while.
Thomas went down to the cabin.
He is a very good master.
His 12 players played very well.
We will join again, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
To these 12 boys I love them and I am proud to be a master.
You will have to catch the hat and bend your head.
