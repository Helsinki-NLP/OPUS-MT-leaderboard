Members of Parliament in Wales are afraid to see you like dudes.
Some members of Parliament were alarmed at the suggestion that their role title would change from AMs to MWPs.
This fear arose after plans to change the name of the court of law to the Welsh Parliment.
Parliamentlors are concerned that this is going to be called.
One Parliamentman from the Laibor Party said his people are afraid it's going to rush with Twp and Pwp.
For his name out of Wales: Walsh, twp means stupid and pwp means pwp.
A member of the Parliament of the Field Camary Party said that all of his friends were “unwelcome ” and offered alternatives.
A member of the Vulgian Parliamentary Party said that his friends were “open to suggestions” about the change of name, but noted that the name MWP (leader of Parliament) seemed to be very similar to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Vulgative W signal is similarly controlled by the expression of the signal and in English in the Yoquire accent.
The Committee of the House of Laws, which now adopts the legislation for the change of names, said: \"The final decision on any description of the names of the members of the House of Representatives is of course the decision of the members of the House of Representatives themselves. \"
The Wills Government Act of 2017 gave the Walsh legislature the authority to change his name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the consultation with the public on the proposals, which gave broad support to the change of the name of the House of Laws to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the function of the MPs, the Committee recommended the Walshi Parliamentlors or the heads of the WMPs, but the MWP option received the majority of support in consulting with the public.
Members of the Parliament offer alternative options, but the struggle to get a concert can cause quite a bit of a headache to the board, Ellen Jones, who is meant to present a draft of legislation about the changes in the next weeks.
The legislation on the interpretation of other changes in the way the legislature works, including rules for the removal of members of Parliament and the establishment of the committee system.
The members of the Parliament were to eventually determine their title of office during the debate on legislation.
Canadian citizens are going to the cards on the wish with a change in the state's name.
The citizens will vote on Sunday on the question whether to change their name to the Republic of Northern Cambodia.
The people's wish was determined in an attempt to resolve a ten-year-old dispute with the neighboring Greek, in which there was a district called Maddonia.
For a long time, Greece claimed that its neighborhood was in the area of Greece and that it had been opposed to the attempt of Macedonia to join the European Union and NATO.
President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, who opposed the people's question about the change of name, said he would ignore his results.
However, those who support the question of the people, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, claim that the name change is just the price to pay to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells of the Church of St. Martin stand in front of the church in Harlem's neighborhood.
According to Mr. Adams, the old neighborhood residents are told that there was a bar and a church in every corner.
There are no bars or churches today.
According to him, Bar's disappearance can be understood.
People's company lives today are running differently.
Bars are no longer the neighborhood living room where people visit on a regular basis.
As for the churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of assets will not last for so long as the heads of the church expect, and sooner or later, they will find themselves again at the beginning.
According to the church’s place, apartment buildings with shared homes are to be held with people who are not of the kind who will help the neighborhoods maintain a unique character.
The vast majority of the people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people to speak, so it will make sense the closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that most people who move to these apartments will join these churches.
The two churches were built by Protestant communities, before Harlem became a neighborhood whose majority of the blacks - the Church of the Commonwealth of Metropolitan in 1870, and St. Martin 10 years later.
The White Hindu community left in the late 1930s.
A black faith community in the area became the owner of the building.
The Church of St. Martin moved to the Black Community under the pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a mob against traders on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or advance blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused severe damage to the building, but as part of the plans of the believers under Pastor Johnson to rebuild it, they invited the construction of the bell career.
Pastor David Johnson, the son of Johnson the Father, who inherited his place in St. Martin's Church, was proud of the idea of the bells of the poor.
The expert who defended the July movie called it another name: \"Cultural treasure\" and a historical tool that doesn't have a replacement\"
The expert, Tipney Eing, University of Michigan, also mentioned that it was the world's first bell card that was protected by a black musician, Dionecio E. Lind, who was continuously defending the biggest career in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Marior said St. Martin's Church didn't replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin's Church over the past few months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some of whom have been brought up by local heads of church, and others by the apiscoplasms.
The meeting, which is the governing body of the community of believers, was held in July, a letter that the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses wrote to the publishers of a letter expressing its concern that the Governing Body would try to roll the costs to the meeting, even though the meeting was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent to the congregations in Jerusalem.
Some of the believers complained of lack of visibility on the part of the Jews.
13-year-old boy's arrow to catch lobsters
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while the boy was playing to capture lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, so they gave up official causes.
The attack occurred shortly before 7:00 a.m. next to the Beakon Coast in Ainentias.
Chad Hamel told the KSWB-TV network of San Diego that he was playing with friends from this when it was Saturday morning, when he heard the boy screaming for help and then coming there with a team to help him put him on the beach.
Hamel thought in the beginning, but it was just a lot of enthusiasm for lobster hunting, but then he realized that the boy was yelling at me!
I was bitten!
Hamel said that when he approached the boy, he saw that all his escape bone was broken.
I cried out to everybody out of the water, \"There's a shark in the water!\"
The boy was born to Rady Hospital in San Diego, where he was defined as a human being.
Unknown to some species of shark that attacked the boy.
Saving Commander Larry Giles said in a press briefing that a shark was identified in a region a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous food shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body.
Authorities have closed access to the beach between the Punto Bassballad Coast and the Suami Coast in Asentias for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles said there were more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them aren't considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is starting in a competition with Bots, Superdrug and Debenhams and opens crossings in a dog store style with professional women.
As part of a significant initiative to enter the British beauty market, which runs 2.8 billion Starlings a year, and which continues to grow while sales in fashion and home-to-home areas, the extensive transfers of beauty products will be checked in 11 stores across the country and if the experiment is successful, added to other stores next year.
Investing in beauty products comes at a time when there are other ways of using a shelf area previously captured by TVs, microwaves, and home-made devices.
From Sainsbury's said that the company is expected to double its production of beauty products up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time in her history.
Existing product lines of companies L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also win a further area with brand zones similar to those in shops such as Bots.
The network also re-launchs its makeup product lines - Butique - so most of the products will be friendly to naturalists, a characteristic that has been found to grow in the midst of young buyers.
In addition, the Fragranance Shop web will check the winnings at the two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened at the Crawden, South London, last week and the second will open at Sly Oak, Bramingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and buying too small amounts of food every day in local restaurants are required to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Jaqa, president of Saninsbury's, said that the branches would become more bloody to dog stores while the property network was trying to fight against the cheap networks Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's added Argos's sales points in hundreds of stores as well as a number of Habitat Points since she bought both networks two years ago, adding that she has sold the goods and made the acquisitions more profitable.
Previous network attempts to revive the beauty product departments and their pharmacists ended with failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint initiative with Bots in the early 2000s, but communication ended after a disagreement on how to share the profits from the pharmaceuticals inside the ingredients.
The new strategy comes after-Sainsbury's sold the business activity of the 881 Snipies to Celesio, owner of the Loyds-Networks network for 125 million Starlings three years ago.
According to her, Loyds would play a role in the program, by expanding the brands of expensive leather products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Sainsbury's commercial manager, Paul Mills-Hicks, said: \"We've made a contrast in the appearance and a sense of pasturing our beauty products, to improve the environment for customers.
In addition, we have invested in those who have been specially trained and who will be able to provide advice instead.
Our brands are designed to match every need and attractive environment and our comfortable locations make us an attractive destination for the acquisition of beauty products, in a way that threatens the old ways of shopping.
Peter Jones is angry after Holly Willaby cancelled an 11 million-starling deal.
The TV show star Dragons Den, Peter Jones, expressed a rage after playing TV Holly Wilaby cancelled an 11 million-starring deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks And Spencer and with ITV
Actually, Wilby doesn't have time to brand their house clothes and accessories.
The joint business of the two is similar to the Goop version of the Player's Guinth Paltro.
The 37-year-old This Morning programern announced her absence at Post in Istanbul.
Holly Willaby left the planet Dragons Den Peter's angry show that she had recently cancelled her participation in the two expensive lifestyle brand - to focus on her fat contracts with Marks And Spencer and with ITV.
Sources have said that Jones responded with rage when the TV star was announced during a storm meeting on Tuesday in his business empire's main offices in Marlo, Bakinga-Mierre, whose new deals -- worth up to 1.5 Starlings -- did not have enough time to pay for the clothes and their accessories Truly.
The joint business of the two was similar to the Goop version of \"Guinth Paltro\" player and was expected to double Willaby's fortune, which was taught at 11 million Starlings.
While Willaby's 37-year-old was posted in Astram that she was leaving Truly, Jones was on a flight from Britain to one of his resorts.
According to one source, \"Truly was undoubtedly the top of Holly's priority.
It was supposed to be her future for the long term to provide her with income for the next few decades.
A decision to leave surprise all those involved in the thing.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
The Marlo Company’s warehouses are full of products ready for sale.
Experts believe that This Morning's service, which is one of the most profitable stars in the UK, may cost a million million dollars as a result of huge investments in diverse products, began metal and candles to household clothes, and the potential for further retardation.
And that might bring about the end of long companies.
Wilabby, who is a mother to three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willabe set up Truly with Cap in 2016, and Jones, age 52, joined his company in March.
The couple spent vacations together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willabe becomes the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Annette McFpertlin as an I'm A Celebrity program of ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: \"We don't react about his business\"
Tough conversation and then we fell in love'
He made fun of her criticism. He won from the new press the impression that some define as “no-presidential ” and that he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump do so much giving up?
\"Tramp said in the voice of a new pitcher\"
I didn't give up.
He pointed out that Kim was interested in a second meeting after taking up their first position in June as a big step in the direction of North Korea's nuclear explosion.
But the negotiation of the launch is a frozen nuclear weapon.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the senior diplomat from North Korea, Ri Young Ho, told the world leaders on Saturday at the United Nations General Meeting that North Korea would not see a positive response from the U.S. to the initial weapons launch steps in North Korea.
Instead, according to him, U.S.B. continues with the sentences to continue the pressure.
Trump was taken at a much more optimistic point of view in his speech in custody.
We're in great shape with North Korea. He said.
We almost went to war against North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results - the separation of missile experiments, assistance in the release of prisoners and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his extraordinary approach to talking about the relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full stadium, we've had about 200 people standing there.
A tsunami and a land convention in Indonesia caused the destruction of an island and the killing of hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Luxembourg, for example, there were non-governmental foreign organizations that needed their help.
Although more than 10% of the Lombobs population lost their homes, no national disaster was announced, which is subject to an international assistance rogation.
Unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not seeking international assistance, so that's a little challenging.
Although Save the Child's organization makes a team to travel to Palo, it's not yet clear if foreign envoys can move in the field.
Mr. Sotopo, the speaker of the Agency for National Disasters, said that the authorities of Indonesia are taking part in the assessment of the situation in Palo to see if more of the international bathrooms contribute to the relief effort.
In view of the relentless earthquake in Indonesia, the country is unfortunately not ready enough for natural disasters.
While tsunami shelters are built in Acha County, they are rare in other coastal areas.
The obvious lack of alarms is likely to warn of a tsunami in Pallo, although there is a warning, has contributed to mental loss.
Even in the best times, the journey between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship that's gonna protect the Lombocs to take care of earthquake fighting is doing its way to Palo, but it's gonna take at least three days to get to the new disaster zone.
The dramatic improvement of Indonesia's evil infrastructure was at the centre of President J'aco Widuho's campaign, and he invested many funds on roads and railways.
But Mr. J'Cow has been present with funding for his confrontation to be re-elected next year.
Mr. J' and Ko were also under pressure from continuing religious tensions in Indonesia as a result of the religious ceremony of the Muslim majority in the country.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes in battle between Christian and Muslim groups on the streets, using knives, cans, and other domestic weapons.

The ball flew high above the floor and landed towards the upper right corner of the network.
Eventually, the ball landed above the Capa Arritchuga gate that was snuck into it and fell into the net.
I was just trying to get to this position, get to the ball and players like Shac always play forward as far as possible, so I was just trying to create myself as long as possible.
I saw Canta and I made one touch and I didn't think of it too much and I just kicked.
Chasie led 0-1 in the middle after the Belgian star Aden left the gate in the 25th minute.
The Blue Start transferred a boat back to Mao Kobatch in the same game before he turned around in the middle of the field and drove quickly into the middle of Librepol's field.
Kobatch's made a quick throttle in the middle of the field.
Then he kicked a beautiful cross kick, which led the laser into the floor.
The front left the defense and ended with the ball in the top right corner of the gate, with a left kicking off the Liverpool Allison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli at the champion League's home stage on Wednesday at 15:00 in the San Paulo stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chasie will face a video in the European League of Opa on Thursday at 15:00 in London.

A police speaker confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and that she was inside a building.
Friends who knew the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning came to the scene this afternoon.
Investigations are ongoing while the police have now announced that they are in the process of sending messages to relatives.

The Cromwell Parliament’s Parliament has become the next target of attacks on memory situations in the struggle around “the book of history”
Celebration of the statue will be a poetic justice in the light of the Italian succession carried out by his Protestant supporters in so many cultural and religious art objects in England.
But in Cromwell League, they claim Mr. Crick's offer is stupid and is trying to rewrite history.
John Goldssmith, a Cromwell League, said: \"Introduced is that the current controversy over the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell's character that you've been posted outside the Westminster Palace will become a target.
The statues of the English Civil Wars were not made at Cromwell's orders and were not carried out by him.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell fell victim to the acts of one of his predecessors, Thomas Cromwell, in the century before.
The impressive representation of Cromwell in the hands of the statue Sir William Thornipott, is a testimony to the reflection of the 19th century and a part of the history of a figure that many still believe deserves honor.
Mr. Goldssmith said to the solar newspaper, \"Crowmwell was captured by many, perhaps more than at the end of the 19th century than today, as those who defended the Parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course the royal.
The question of whether this is an entirely accurate assessment is a matter of continuing historical controversy.
A fact that has no interest in it is that the struggle in the middle of the 17th century designed our nation's development further, and Cromwell is one identified figure representing one side of the corner at the same time.
Its achievements as a shield Lord are also worthy of respect and victory.
Fatal pig driving a Chinese farmer to death.
Local media sources report that a pig attacked a farmer in a market in South-West China.
The man, identified as his family \"Wiwan\" was found dead with a bad artery covered in blood next to the pig's place in the Blogpensoi market in Guijhou County, so reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A farmer prepares to fire vaccines for pigs on pig farms on May 30, 2005 in Shining County, Chenghai, China.
According to the reports, he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yuan district to sell 15 pigs on the market on Wednesday.
The next day his cousin found him dead, and he found a door to an open pighouse.
He said that Diir was found a big male pig with blood on his mouth.
A criminal investigation confirmed that the pig weighing 250 pounds attacked the farmer, according to the report.
My uncle's legs were full of blood and bars, telling the cousin that his family name was Wow, as quoted in the Guiyang Events News.
On a security camera, Joan seems to be entering a market on Thursday morning at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Joan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked behind bars to keep him from attacking other people, while the police were collecting evidence at the scene.
It is said that there is a negotiation between Joan's family and the market authorities for compensation for his death.
Although a rare phenomenon has already been reported, there have been cases in which pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused human casualties.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig hunted an agricultural farmer in Wales to his tractor until the farmer's wife escaped the animal.
After an organization farmer joined by his pigs in 2012, one of the best farmers told the CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood could be a trigger.
They're just playing.
They're like naughty kids, very explorers... They're not gonna hurt you.
He just needs to give them the measure of respect they deserve.
The hurricane remnants Rosa will cause heavy rains in large areas in the south-west of the U.S.
According to the forecast, the hurricane Rosa was weakened as it moved over the colder waters on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
The storm, however, brings floods all over northern Mexico and south-west of U.S.A. over the next few days.
The winds at the storm of Ruza have reached 135 miles per hour, that is, the hurricane of hurricanes at Level 1, and is valid for Sunday at 5 a.m. according to the East Coast clock, the storm station is about 620 km south of Punta Eugena, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is becoming a producer over the east Pacific that moves east toward the east coast of U.S., with a sharp approach to the half of the island of California on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will start pushing north-west of the U.S.
Rosa brings up to 250 m of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, tropical showers that will be combined with the approaching peak produce heavy rains in vast areas in the south-west of the Americas over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 100 millimeters of rain will result in flooding and endangering land mines in the desert.
Deep tropical rains will make rain amounts reach 50 to 75 m in an hour at different points, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Rains in quantities of 50 to 100 m are expected in parts of the south-west of the U.S., especially in Arizona.
There will be flash floods with conditions that are rapidly deteriorating because of the spillage of the tropical rain.
It is very advisable to avoid going to long distances in the desert when there is a danger to tropical rain.
A heavy rain may turn the rivers into rainy rivers, and thunderous rains will bring winds from strong winds and floods of dust.
The approaching Happ will bring local rainwaters to the coastal areas of South California.
There's a total amount of rainy rain, which can cause waste and smooth roads.
It'll be the first rain in this rainy season.
Tropic rainwaters will begin to reach Arizona on Sunday morning and Monday morning, and the rain will be increased and spread further Monday and Tuesday.
A heavy rain will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and will last on Wednesday.
In October there may be sharp temperature changes all over the U.S., while the Arctic region is cold but the tropical region is quite warm.

On Sunday, there is an excellent example of extreme temperature changes around the center of the United States.
There's a temperature range of almost 10 degrees between Kinshasa City, Michigan and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis, Iva.
In the coming days, long summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
At the beginning of October, temperatures would be warm in most central and eastern parts of the Americas, moving between 27-31 degrees from the southern to the north-east.
In New York City the temperature may reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 5 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast shows high chances for higher average temperatures in the east of the Americas in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Bert Kovano's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday, on six television networks, the legacy of the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kwano, and the woman who accused him of an alleged sexual assault in the last 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political conflict has continued, with new flashlights in the regular broadcasts to announce a surprising development on Friday: an agreement drawn up by Senator Arizona J.F.P.P.P.P.I. will conduct a week-old investigation into the charges.
Ford told the St.'s Legal Committee that she was 100% sure that Kwano was exhausted when he was drunk and was trying to take her out during a high school students' party.
Cavano, you know, you know, you know, he said he's 100% sure it didn't happen.
The number of viewers is likely to be higher than the 20.4 million reported.
Neelsen checked average CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data were not available immediately for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nelson usually makes it difficult to measure people who watch the offices.
For the comparison, it is an audience viewer that is similar to that of the football playoff or the Oscar ceremony.
According to Nelson's data, the Fox News Channel, which supports the appointment of Cavano, led from all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's hearing.
ABC stood second with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to the Nelson Report.
The level of interest remains high after the hearing.
Senator Flyke was the main figure in the drama that went down on Friday.
After the Ministry of the Holy Republic issued a message that he would vote in favour of the Kavano appointment, he was filmed by CNN and CBS photographers when a group of protestors yell at him trying to get into the elevator to get to the hearing at the Legal Committee.
He's been at a humiliating look for a few minutes while the attacks went away, when all of this is taken live in CNN.
I'm standing here before you. One of the women said.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
He was told, you have power while so many women are helpless.
Flyke said that he had posted a message and said, before the elevator door closed, he would say other things at the hearing of the committee.
All the networks and cables were broadcast for a few hours later, when the Legal Committee was about to point out the Kwano's submission to the cent vote.
But Felix said he'll vote for the appointment only if you get an understanding from the FBI to investigate the charges against the candidate over the next week, which required the members of the democratic minority.
Felix is partly convinced of the existence of conversations with his friend, the democratic Senator Chris Cones.
After a conversation with Cons and a number of senators later, Felix made his decision.
Felix's decision had power, because it was clear that the Republicans would not be able to confirm the appointment of Quano without investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kovano.
Head of the British government, Teresa May, accused visitors that they were playing in politics on the Bracsite issue.
Prime Minister Teresa May accused her visitors of leaving the European Union that they were playing in politics with a Federation of Britain and hits on the national Internet in an interview given to the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa May is at the Sovereign Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Joneson continued to attack her \"Dump Game\" show to Barkzit, saying that the offer that Britain and the European Union would raise this cover of this is totally unfair.

Conflict broke out later that day when cops were forced to use gods to overcome the protestors.
For a number of hours, independent groups have been standing unsatisfying, unsatisfying, unsatisfying, in front of the individual supporters called Spain’s brothers.
In the local press, 14 people were reported to have been treated with minor injuries suffered by the protestors.
The tension remains high in the independent areas of the year after asking the people on October 1 to be sentenced to a legal prison by the government of Spain, but we will be celebrated by independent Catalans.
The voters chose most of the big votes to become an independent country, although the vote rate was low when those who refused to break up most of the voting were restricted.
The authorities in Catalonia reported that almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the falcon vote being held throughout the area in violent conflict.
Independent groups set up night-time stations on Friday to prevent a national police demonstration.
The demonstration took place but had to run a different course.
Narcisse Trems, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the fight with his wife, said he had lost hope about Catalonia's chance of independence.
Last year we experienced our best moments.
I've seen my parents cry happy for being able to vote, but now we're stuck - he said.
Although the Italian dinars won an important victory, although long, in the last December, they were able to maintain momentum this year when they understood their most well-known leaders, either willingly or in prisons, waiting for some of them to be tried in the People ' s Movement organization and for their declared independence.
Juan Fogg, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police support demonstration on his phone, said that the conflict was engaged by politicians on both sides of the conflict.
It's going wild. He said.

Number of men arrested after a car hit the house.
Three men - age 33.34 and 39 - arrested after a car crashed several times in the Blondundri house.
The event took place in Linaghurg Carsent on Thursday, around 19:30 a.m., according to Britain's clock.
Detective Bob Belmings said there was damage to the gates as well as to the building itself.
At some point, a bow might also have been shot into the car.
He's kicking a mango gives Livingstone 1-0 win over Rang's.
Dolly Manga's first gate to Livingstone promised victory
Livingston, who just went up to the league, made Rang's and Amena Steven Jared, which is just his second loss in 18 games as the director of the IBBR club.
Dolly Menga's kicking meant a lot, since Gary Holt's team had moved up with Hibranian in the other place.
GER's group remains unwinted outside the home at the top of the season, and deals with lead Harts, which is behind eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rang'ers will host Ravid Vienna at the European League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston extended the missing sequence of losses at home to six games, and Chief Coach Holt has never experienced a break since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities in front of a weak-approaching group
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before the gate was laid, when their traffic caused Rang's to have different problems.
Scott Robinson broke out ahead but dragged his attempts before the gate, and then Alan Leather could only focus his efforts on the space after he slipped in to meet Craig's sight before the gate.
The hosts would be willing to allow Rings to play in front of them, knowing that they could be difficult for the host group with free kicks.
And it was the way the major gate went.
Herring's got a free kick and Livingston created an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to block the Manga, which came into contact and struck a gate from the center of the expansion.
At this point, Herng's ruled over the holding of the ball, but they found the house's protection to be impregnable, and the exposure to Liam Kelly was almost unattended.
This pattern was drawn to the second half, although Alfredo Murlos did force Kelly to save the gate.
Scott Pittnam was beaten by Rang's gatemen, Alan McGegor, and Lithoe touched a bullet from another free kick of Livingstone.
Cross-bulls continued to enter Livingston's floor and brakes, while two penalty pills -- after a hit by a hit on Glen Middton replacement, and one on hand touch -- were taken away.
\"Malignant\" -- surgery.
Alistier to Mont, BBC Scotland at Tony Macrone's stadium.
An amazing game and an amazing result from Livingstone.
All the players were great, and keep on watching this shift up.
Their game style and they've almost never changed since they've been back to the lead position, but they've been giving a great deal of credit for the way he's dried up the team since they arrived.
He had so many stars.
Captain Holkett was great, and he led a tremendously organized defense, while a race that kept Connor Goldson and G and Waral in high numbers all the way.
However, Herng's were unethical.
Although they were pretty good sometimes under GER, they didn't stand on these standards.
They were missing the final ball -- only once they opened up the home group defense -- and that's a red shot to Rang's, which found themselves in the middle of the field.
Acceptance involved in Jordan's caclen.
There were smiles and blue sky when Turkish and German leaders met on Saturday (29 September) for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdovan's controversial visit to Germany - the goal of which was to correct the relationship between the two member states in the Bar.

The hurricane has been threatening the flash floods in Pienix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's rare that Truffy hit in Arizona, but that's exactly what's expected to happen at the beginning of next week, when the remnants of the hurricane Rosa will cross the desert in the south-east and bring with them a danger to flash floods.
The National Air Service has already declared a danger to flash floods on Mondays and Tuesdays for Western Arizona into south-east Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Pinix, Falgstaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The storm Rosa is expected to go through a direct course over Pinix on Tuesday, and approach at the end of Monday with rain.
Pinix National Air Service has posted a Twitter that only 10 trophies have been left on a tropical storm status or a trophie floor within a range of 322 km from Pennix since 1950!
The Katrina storm (1967) was a hurricane of 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of Arizona's hurricane storm center watch 50 to 100 mil rain, with insulate amounts of up to 150 m in the Mogulone slopes of Arizona.
Other areas in the south-west desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Garden, are expected to have 25 to 50 miles [50 km] of water, with the possibility of isolated areas being reached by about 50 miles [50 km].
For those outside the danger zone of flash floods, the rain of the Rosa storm may be a blessing because the area suffered from drought.
Although floods are a serious danger, some of these rains will help because the southern region is currently suffering from condition.
According to Urab's shape surveillance, over 40% of Arizona is in a difficult shape, which is the second category of its hardware, so the website was reported.com.
First, the course of the Rosa storm will be to land across the half island of a California sister in Mexico.
A Rosa storm, which is still in the morning's hurricane power with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, is located 620 km south of the Ponta Eugene, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of about 20 km/h.
The storm hit the colder water in the Pacific, so it got weaker.
So she's expected to reach the land in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm in the hours of the afternoon or Monday evening.
The rains across parts of Mexico may be heavy and risk a strong flood.
Total rain amounts of 75 to 150 m are expected from the Bay of California to the north-west of Sonora, with a chance to report a waterher.com website.
Then Rosa storm will continue into Mexico as a tropical storm, before you reach the Arizona border at the early morning hours of Tuesday when a trophie was struck, which will then proceed on the face of Arizona into South Utah on a Tuesday night.
The main danger ahead of Rosa, or its remnants, is heavy rains in the south-west of Sonora and the south-west desert in the Far East, from the National Center for hurricanes.
These rains are expected to cause floods and life - threatening disasters in the desert and earthquakes in the mountains.

Trump said that Kwano suffered the convictions and anger of the Democratic Party.
Judge Kovano's vote is a vote to reject the rudeness of the wind and the shocking tactics of the Democratic Party.
Trump said that Kwano had suffered the anger of the democratic party throughout the process of being appointed.
Kovano testified to Congress on Thursday, while he strongly denies the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her guilt.
The President said on Saturday that Arrab residents saw the brilliants and the quality and courage of Cavanaugh the same day.

The president closely referred to the appointment of Quano as he spoke of the importance of the Republicans to vote in the mid-term election.

I'm not a candidate, but actually I am a candidate.
That's why I'm running everywhere to fight for great candidates.

A senior assistant at the Republican Party tells the CNN that the first central parliamentary vote of the Senate on the appointment of Quano is expected to be held no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths on the ground convention and a tsunami in Indonesia, and the number is rising.
At least 384 people were killed, many of them carried huge waves crashing on the coasts when a heavy earthquake and tsunami hit the Indian Solowasi island, reporting official sources on Saturday.
Very people gathered at a beach festival in Palo on Friday, when waves on a height of six feet (18 feet) crashed on the beach at sunset, pushing many to their death and ruining everything on their way.
The sunniest was followed by an earthquake of 7.5.
When the tsunami threat woke up yesterday, people were still engaged in their affairs on the beach rather than immediately fled, and they fell victim to it. So So Sotopo Forva Noruho, speaking Agency for the Treatment of BNPB Disasters, in an Akata briefing.
The tsunami didn't come by himself, it dragged cars, wooden holes, houses, it hit everything on the ground, said Noraho, and added that the sunnim progressed across the open sea at a speed of 800 miles (497 miles an hour) before walking on the beach line.
Some people were working on trees to escape the tsunami and they survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people turned to 24 centers in Palo.
Air photographs published by the Insanity Agency have shown destruction to a number of houses and stores, surrounded bridges and churches and a mosque surrounded by water.
It was a shock that kept shaking the beach town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes is killed in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The BPPT in Indonesia announced that the energy released on Friday's power conference was 200 kt of the atomic bomb on the World War II.
According to him, the geography of the city, which sits at the edge of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the sunnim.
Noruho described the destruction as a huge disaster, saying that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were trapped under the debris of buildings that collapsed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing people.
Norroy said that the number of deaths and damage could be greater along the north of Palo with a beach line 300 miles (190 miles), a zone called Dongella, and closer to the area of focus of the earthquake.
The media are completely broken, and there's no information - from Angola, Norroy said.
In the area, more than 300,000 people have said the red cross in a statement, adding that his men and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
It's already a tragedy, but the situation may get much worse.
On Saturday, a great deal of criticism was expressed to the agency that it had not been announced that a tsunami had hit Palo, even though official factors said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In the video, which has been printed on social networks, a man on a high roof of a building is able to shout a warning warning of the tsunami approaching people on the street below it.
Within minutes of water crashes on the beach, carrying buildings and cars with him.
The Ritters Message Agency couldn't make sure that the photo was authentic.
The earthquake and tsunami caused extensive power stops that cut the media around Palo and made it difficult for the authorities to match the rescue efforts.
The army began sending planes with aid from Acarta and other caves, according to the authorities, but the survivors still need desperate food and other vital necessities.
The city airport was only opened for aid efforts and remained closed until October.
President J'Cow and his troops were scheduled to visit the rescue centers in Pallo on Sunday.
From the death of a tsunami in Indonesia to more than 800.
It's very difficult.
While the people of the World Vision organization from Angola came in peace to the city of Palo, where shelter workers made up of a tower in their offices' courtyards were set up, they passed through mirrors of destruction on their way, saying Mr. Dosba.
They told me they saw many homes destroyed.
It's very difficult.
Even as relief teams began with the unfortunate actions of the disaster relief movement, our complaint was that you had been prevented from reaching Paul’s palace of highly experienced foreign aid workers.
According to the regulations of Indonesia, only if the damaged area is defined as a national disaster zone can we begin to recover funding, supplies and people from other countries.
This thing isn't done yet.
It's still defined as a district-level disaster.
After the government says \"All right, this is a national disaster\" we can open the door to international assistance, but this status has not yet been announced.
With the fall of the second night on Palo after the earthquake of the earth and the tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing were gathered to hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that leave the sad stories of natural disasters.
Saturday, little boy pulled off a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers stole a woman buried under debris for two days, with her mother's body on her side.
Gandondo, the coach of the Indonesian welfare team, trained two of the missing landscape posts for Asian games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others understand that they were trapped in a hotel seeing, and Mr. Mendgi, among them, were his students.
- I carry my own emotional burden. - He said.
Mr. Gandon recalls how when the news of hotel collapses saw it common among the Spaniards Community, he successfully sent whatsApp messages to the contestants in Pallo, who were part of the beach festival.
However, his messages showed only one gray sign of criticism, instead of the blue marks.
I think it means that the messages were not delivered.

Kenya West: Rapher changed his name to Ye
Harper Kenya and set are changing his name to Ye.
On the announcement of the change on Saturday, he wrote: \"The people who were known as Kenya West\"
And the 41-year-old set was named Ye for a while and he used his 8-year-old album in June.
The change is due first to his appearance on the TV show Studio Nate Liv, where he's expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for emotional reasons, so he said the program's maker.
In addition, it is the shortness of his current professional name, and the past line says that word has religious meaning for him.
I think that 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible the word means 'you and St said earlier this year, when you spoke of the name Album with Radio Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the one and only, to just 'Ye' -- just a reflection of the best we have, the bad that we've built, or the confused, everything.
The album is more reflections of who we are.
He's one of some famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Compes was known to exchange the name Puff Daddy, Peddy or Deeds, but the year he declared that he preferred the names “love” and “love of brothers”.
West's ex-partner, J.Z., also moved between his own version of the name with and without a copy and the letters of the license.
The President of Mexico made a commitment not to use the army against civilians
The President-elect of Mexico, Andres Manuel Luops Overdor, has the obligation never to use military force against civilians while the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody restraint against students.
Lups Oberdor promised on Saturday at the Teltulloco square never to use the military to suppress the Mexican people
Armed forces shot at the non-violent demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing some 300 people when the movements of Maltese students began to develop in all Latin America.
Lups Overdor committed to supporting young Mexicans by giving financial support to those who learn and open up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people into criminal gangs.
Irrab should double the funding of an artificial building.
With China's increased activity in artificial intelligence, U.S.B. has to double the amount she invests in research in the field, so the investigator who is engaged in artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu-I, who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His words come after various parts of the U.S. government have published statements about artificial construction, even as the U.S. government has no formal artificial construction strategy.
In the meantime, China presented her plan last year: she'd like to be number one artificially built by 2030.
The double budget for artificial intelligence research will be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence.
The double funding can double the chances that the next big artificial understanding will be obtained in Biab, telling me to the CNBC network at the week's interview.
Li, the librarian - AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, came to light this month with the release of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, a manager of the Sienovation Ventures, who invested in the most important artificial intelligence company in China: Facebook+.
In the early 1980s at Carnegie Mallon University, he worked on an artificial building system that defeated the first major major major major major major majorist in China, and later served as senior director at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee recognized the previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the agency's robotic challenge for advanced research projects, and asked when you will be next, to help identify the next vision people.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, he told me.
It's not China that's taking us the lead investigators at the Academy, it's the business companies that do it.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years recruited stars from universities to work in artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help Lara to strengthen her efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
I think it should be automatically offered to the owner of a doctor's degree in artificial intelligence.
In July 2017, the China State Council published its artificial intelligence development plan for the next generation.
The Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Science Fund and other government organizations for research in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, to me.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department set up a joint artificial-enhancing centre for the evening of partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a special artificial white committee.
And the month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative in artificial intelligence under the name AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, a legislation initiative designed to create a national security and artificial building committee has not been operational for months.
The people from Cambodia vote on the question with the question whether to change the name of the country.
On Sunday, the people of Cambodia are voting on the question of whether to change their name to the Republic of Northern Cambodia, a step that would solve a ten-year-old dispute with Greece that prevented its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is a district called Macdonia, claims that the name of her neighborhood is in the field of Greek and Tetto, and the name of the European Union.
Both countries signed in June on a deal based on the average new name, but opposition to Germans claims that the change would affect the ethnic identity of the majority of the Salvadoran population in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote in the people's question and that the question of whether the majority of the voters would stand the minimum 50 percent required for the question of the people to be effective.
The question in the ballot is this: Are you in favour of joining NATO and the European Union with the receipt of the agreement with Greece?
Those who support the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, claim that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, which is one of the countries created by Yugoslavia's deployment, will be able to join bodies like the European Union and NATO.
I came here today to point to the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safe life for all of us.
Although the question of the people was not legal, enough members of Parliament said they would go to the vote to make it up.
To change the name will take a lot of two-thirds of the Parliament.
The State Election Committee said there were no misunderstandings right at 13:00.
However, the vote was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, with 66 percent of the voting rights.
I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe.
The Prime Minister of Cambodia, Zoran Zeev, and his wife, Zuricha and his son Dokko complete their ballot in Stromiz, Macdonia, on September 30, 2018, on the people's question of the country's change in name, which would open the door to Nata and the European Union.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Chowderkov, Parliamentary Front, made a small platter and chairs in front of halls that set up the people's wishes.
We're in favour of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join the head of the coast, not the way the servants enter, said Kwarderkov.
We're a poor country, but we have respect.
If they don't want to take us to Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of an Asian euro union.
Prime Minister Zeyev said that Bante's companies would bring the most urgent investment to Macedonia, where unemployment rate was 20 percent.
I believe that the vast majority will be in favour that over 80 percent of our citizens support the European Union and NATO, said Zeev after his vote.
He said that a positive outcome would be our future security.
A survey published on Monday by the Department of Policy Research of Cambodia showed that between 30 and 43% of the voters would participate in the people's question - less than the required participation rate.
Another question, held by the Portuguese TV network, has found that 57 of the missions are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the people to be successful, the vote should be at least 50% plus one.
The failure of the left would be the first significant loss of pro-West government policy since last year's government took control of May.
Video: An Actor from Sanchester City, His Scratch Aguero, heading through the entire Bryton defense to score a gate.
Mr. Aguero and the Sterling brothers broke Bryton's defense at Menchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at a union stadium in Menster, England.
Looks like Aguero's wearing the gate easy.
The Argentine pioneer received a handover in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He ran between the three Bryton defense players before he broke into the open field.
At this point Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one shield before he got a few more shields on Bryton's extended border.
And then he kicked the left boat, and he found Sterling.
The English rescue used his first touch across to deliver the ball back to Agoro, which hit the right foot of Briton, Matthew Ryan, with a bullet to the right side of the network.
Agoro has problems with his feet, said the director of Manchester City for the reporters.
We agreed he'd play about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he was wearing a gate at that moment.
However, it was Sterling that gave the “seamings” the initial advantage of the upper league fighting.
This gate came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Bryton's field during this.
He sent a great crossball along the right wing to Leroy Sana.
Sana ran the ball before he led Sterling towards the far-sighted grave.
The sky blue player pushed the ball into the net right before he pulled out of the field.
Menchester City will face fashionists at the champions' league game on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rain-Nakar Forum in Zinsheim, Germany.
An alien wants to play Spyler in front of Hercules.
With the Hensenes' exit from the playoff competition, there was no good reason to force another start.
But a hairdresser who is very competitive, hopes to win on Sunday in front of Colorado Rockis, but only if there are still consequences about the playoffs for the rocking, leading one game on the Los Angeles Dodgeches at the NL West League.
Hercules shot at least a spot of an open 5-2 winning ticket on the ninches on Friday night, but they haven't promised themselves the first place at home yet.
Although we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play knowing that the air here in Denver with the viewers and the other team will play the highest probably at every point I'm gonna face this year.
Why don't I want to deal with it? ’
The Nationals have not been calling it the beginning of Sunday, but according to the reports they tend to let a priest serve in such a situation.
A scratch, which would be his 34th start, was a bulpan training exercise on Thursday and submitted on his day of rest -- Sunday.

Trump has been arrested in West Virginia.
The President strongly referred to the situation around his elected candidate for the Supreme Court of Burt Kwano, as he spoke of the importance that Republicans would have to vote in the middle of the election.
Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five more weeks for the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the most, the most I don't deal with, but actually I'm dealing with and so I'm running everywhere and fighting for great candidates, he said.
Trump went on and said, \"You see this terrible and horrible group of extreme democracys, you see this happening right now.
And if we are determined to take back the power by whatever means it takes, you see the convictions, the disappointments.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they need to run to get power and control, that's what they want. It's power and control, we're not gonna give it to them.
Democrats are, according to him, on a mission to resist and interfere
And you've seen it over the last four days. He said, and it's the Democrats who are angry and mean and rude.
He mentioned the minority leader on the St.'s Legal Committee, the Democratic Senator Diane Pinstein, which dragged high-level buff readings from the audience.
Remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, wait until -- it was really a bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a Floralisty.
She can't stand the person who's expressing her opinion.
When momentum operators at my local party party voted to snoop me, it wasn't really a surprise.
After all, I'm the last in the line of members of Parliament from Leabur who told them they weren't welcome -- and only because we put our minds up.
My colleague at Parliament, Joan Ryan, had the same relationship because she was aggressive against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the decision to cut me off visited me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe - most of the irony, it is similar to those whose heights Jeremy did not agree with previous party leaders.
At the committee on the Eastern Nottingham Liber Party meeting on Friday, it is said that \"We want the meeting to be inclusive and pragmatic\"
For most of my eight years as a member of the local Parliament of the Labour Party, meetings of the General Committee on Friday nights were just like that.
By the way, it is not the tone of many of the meetings and promises of more generous, more delicate politics that have been forgotten a long time ago, if ever.
It turns out more and more that the Laibor Party has no tolerance for different reflections, and any opinion judged by its acceptance of the party's leadership.
This situation began shortly after Jeremy was elected head of the party, when colleagues in the past thought we were sharing a similar political view, began to expect him to make a ruling turn and take positions that I would never agree to -- whether on national security or on a single European market.
Every time I speak in public -- and it doesn't really matter what I say -- right away comes a abuser of social networking with calls for rejection, the political variety of the Centre and the readings that I don't have to be at the libor party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more lucky than I am, because the comments that mean to me tend to be political.
I'm once from the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who stand up every day in front of a cover of racial abuse but never withdraw.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how abuse levels have become an issue.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party had to cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we've been the same place as a floristic, and with all the decisions of \"I\" or a change of choice, the party becomes more difficult.
Over the last two years, I've been forced to keep my mouth shut, not be so loud, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Leabur Party 32 years ago as a school student, it was triggered by the neglect of a college government that caused my public school class almost to fall apart, looking for ways to fight better social services for those who needed them -- whether as a local council member or as a minister of the government.
I've never hidden my political opinions, including in my last election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused about my political and controversial positions with the current leadership.
For those who have made the decision on Friday, all I have to say is that while the country is crawling towards Bracsite that will hurt our families, business and public service, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Libor.
But in fact, the one message I have is not for the momentum movement in Nottingham, but for my elected public, whether they're members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of rejection or political advantage will deter me from acting in a way that I believe most of all of your interests.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Unfashable Air to the top
The last two freshs have slightly reduced the final result, but there is no doubt that Air deserves the victory of the great and wonderful game held today in the Soviet Supreme League.
They're now at the top of the table, the only undistorted side of the ten.
Eventually, it was their best defense, as well as taking the risks much more, that they played for the home group, and coach Peter Morzari had all the reasons to be happy.
We've been on the test of our games so far, and we're still undressed, so I have to be happy, he said.
Robin Christie from the Melrose Group said: \"Lair comes all the credit, they've taken better risks than us.\"
Grant Anderson's 14th minute Trey, sponsored by Fraser Clemo, put Air in the lead position, but a yellow card to the Scottland Rory Hewes team released to the game by the Woryrs, allowed Melrose to get points and Jason Boutt caught a Trey that wasn't Homer.
Clemo raised Eir's lead with a crime, right before he was half the same, and then Mr. Trey Solo got 17-5 air in half.
But Melrose opened the second half well, and Trey of Patrick Angerson, sponsored by Gout, narrowed down the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a severe injury of Rodrich Kenot, taken away in Alonka, and starting with the game's re-news, Air increased the gap through the Troy of Staffford McCadwell, which was said by Clemo.
The captain of Air Blair McFresson took over so a yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of the other man with Trey who wasn't Homer's cologne at the end of a series of tremendous pressure.
But the house crew recovered, and when Strawn the Tichinson got a yellow card on a ballless Clemo attack, from the penalty line, McFresson was a Tach sheep. Down behind Air's advanced wave.
Clemo Meir, as he did again almost again from returning to the game after Kyle Roy S kicked David Armstrong's box and sent Henry's drawer to the sixth Trey of the house group.
Still Game Star appears to be ready for a new career in restaurants.
Star Game, Ford Kirnan, seems ready to move to the restaurant branch after he was discovered to be a manager of a restaurant company in the license.
The 56-year-old player plays the role of \"KJ\" Arvis in BBC's popular program, which he writes and which he's set up with his old partner to comedy, Greg the elephant.
The officer announced that the next ninth season would be the final season of the program, and it seems that Kirsten is planning life after Kryling.
According to the official records, he is the manager of Adriftmore Limited.
The player refused to respond to the story, although a source of Scotch Sun suggested that Kirsten was looking for ways to enter the prosperous restaurant business in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia that doesn't find the sea hope that the court will open a path to the Pacific Ocean.
Soldiers boarded at Navy headquarters were loaded in a few bla-fazz ships.
Public buildings are blubbering a blue flag.
The base seamen from Titicaca Lake to Amazon carry the password: the sea is our right.
It is our duty to sue him back.
All over Bolivia, the memory of a beach line lost in favor of a bloody conflict over 19th century resources is still alive - as well as the chemistry to sail again in the Pacific.
These decisions are perhaps in Chen for decades, while Bolivia is waiting for the international court's decision on October 1, after five years of discussions.
Bolivia has the momentum, one spirit, and peace, and it is, of course, expecting a positive attitude to cry. Roberto said a victory, a Bolivian diplomat.
The decision of the International Court of Justice on major agreements across the country will be shared by many Bolivians, in the hope that the Hague Court will decide in favour of Bolivia's requirement that, after decades of breaking calls, it will be necessary to negotiate the granting of sovereign access to Bolivia.
The President of Bolivia's public school, Oo Morales, who is standing in front of a controversial struggle for re-election next year, holds a lot of its decision on Monday.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific. He promised at the end of August.
But scholars believe that there is no great chance that the court will be declared for Bolivia -- and that even if it decides for it, it won't change much.
The Bhag court has no authority to grant Chilean territory, and the results of possible calls are not to be determined.
The fact that the International Court's claim came only six weeks after hearing the agreed arguments indicates that the case was not complicated, but Paz Zarata, a Chilean expert for an international trial.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's claims, it may even for the last four years have weakened them.
The issue of access to the sea was kidnapped by the current government in Bolivia.
Morals' war history has eliminated every remnant of good will on the part of Chile.
Sometimes Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak, but it will be very difficult to discuss after that.
Both countries have not changed as ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodriguez and Luzza, representative of Bolivia Bhag, rejected the idea that the court must have been abnormally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a great opportunity to open up a new era in relations with Chile, with the prospect of an end to 139 years of conflict in favour of both sides.
Klazadilla also denied Morales - which is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - is using the subject of the seas as a political leverage.
Bolivia will never give up her right to access to the Pacific. He added.
Stopping is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.
North Korea says that the emergence of nuclear damage will not occur unless it can give faith in the turf.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Young, said that they would never unload the nuclear weapon first if she couldn't give trust in Washington.
Ri was talking on Saturday at the UN General Meeting.
He called Larab to keep the promises made during the summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two opposing countries.
His words come as he appears to be the Secretary of State of U.S.A., Mike Pompau, reopened the diplomatic contacts on nuclear weapons that reached a dead end more than three months after the retreat in Singapore with the North Korean leader Kim Gung-un.
Ree said that it was a dream in Aspima to think that the continued sanctions and resistance of the U.S. to announce the end of the Korean war would force North Korea to break into a knee.
The U.S. is afraid to agree to announce without North Korea taking first significant steps to unload nuclear weapons.
They're Kim and they're president Urab, Donald Trump, interested in the second.
However, there is widespread doubt that North Korea is serious about giving up its nuclear weapon status, where it is likely to see the only way to protect its security.
Pompau plans to visit Fongang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
A fashion show in Paris reveals the new transd in giant hats on its way to expensive stores everywhere.
We will find a solution to anyone who wants to expand the collection of hats or get a complete protection from the sun.
The designers and Valentino and Tom Brown exposed a series of huge, crazy head coverings to their SS19 college, in a fashion show that completed the style scene in Paris week.
Unmarried hats that Bill occupied the summer Instagram, and these designers brought their extraordinary works to the fashion show track.
Valentino's oily item was a bottled hat wrapped in wide ranges of convex patterns that covered the heads of the models.
Other prosthet-sized props included acupunctures, a magician hat and even anaesthetics -- but they were not meant to protect their head from the cold.
Tom Brown also exposed a selection of strange masks, looking at the time of Halloween.
Many of the coloring masks contained a more pale, more symbolic form of an ant’s neck than a hummingbird’s eye.
One piece mentioned a scarf mask, including snorkel and glasses, and one other looked like an assailant ice cream cup.
And those who want to continue with a huge fashion statement -- their time has come.
Freakies watch the giant hills make their way to fancy stores everywhere.
The giant hats are the next hit after La Bumba, a tough hat with a three-foot slender on everyone's head, began with Mariana and Emily Rutakowski.
The Calat Lavell behind the very non-explicative hat that opened the social networks, would be another big piece on the track -- a sea bag that is almost as big as the one of a swimwear model that carried it.
The loose-colored ruffy case, with a white-skin-and-skin-a-circuit, was the silent item in the SS19 collection of J.C.E. La Riviera, fashion week in Paris.
\"I watch large hats and large sea bags come to the cold stores next summer -- because the design made a huge impression and it'll be hard to ignore the bad size of the Beaks for ecstasy\"
John Edward: Language skills essential to the world's population
Scotland's independent schools maintain a record of academic excellence, and in 2018 it was followed by a further collection of extraordinary test results, which are supported by personal and collective success in sport, art, music, and other areas of activity in the community.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scotti Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are willing to give the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools that are willing to prepare their students for further education and education, as well as for a career in which they will be chosen and placed as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can plan and make a personal study program, we find that modern languages continue to form an desirable field of study.
Nelson Mandela said, \"If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes into his head.
Speaking to a man in his language, he entered into his heart
It's an important reminder that we can't rely solely on English when we want to build ties and trust with people from other countries.
From the last test results this year, you can see that languages stand in front of tables with the highest success rate in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages got a high A score.
The data gathered from 74 schools that members of SCIS have shown that 72% of the students have achieved a high A score in the dictionary, and therefore 72% of those who have learned German, 69% of those who have learned French and 63% of those who have been taught Spanish.
These data show that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and teenagers will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, the area of languages as a matter of choice is considered to be the same level as those of STEM (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematics) in the programs of independent schools and in other locations.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the British Council for Employment and Skills found that among the reasons why I wanted to be willing to serve abroad, 17 percent would be limited in language skills.
Thus, language skills become essential to preparing students for future careers.
There is a requirement for languages for future job opportunities, these skills are vital in the world of globalism.
No matter what career a person will choose, if he learns a second language, he will have a significant advantage in the future because of that ability that lasts all his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people in foreign lands is automatically stable in a competitive position.
According to a survey of YouGov, which included more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language at a level sufficient to make a conversation, and French was the only language where there was a two-syllable number of speakers, 15%.
That is why it is important to invest now in the instruction of language for children.
In many languages, especially those in developing countries, children will be given a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, every school will be different as to the languages we teach.
Some schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most thought for Britain in a forward-looking way to change the 20th of the 21st century, such as mandry and Japanese.
No matter what the boy's area is, there's always gonna be a variety of languages to choose from at the independent schools, with a teacher team that specializes in the field.
Scotland's independent schools are required to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and develop them with the skills needed to succeed, in every future.
It is impossible to deny that today, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance to the future, so this fact needs to come to an end in education.
Indeed, there is a need to see modern languages as international media skills
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, diversity and respect for the children of Scotland.
It's an hour warrant.
John Edward is head of the Scotch Council for independent schools.
LeBron is expected to play for the first time in the Lakers Media on Sunday in San Diego.
The waiting's over for fans waiting to see LeBron James playing for the first time in the Los Angeles Lakers team.
The Lakers coach, Luke Wallton, announced that James would play the pre-colony game opened in front of the Denver was hit on Sunday in San Diego.
But we've not set a few minutes yet. He'll play.
It'll be more than one and less than 48 - written on Lakers' official website.
The Lakers Mike Trudel posted on Twitter, which is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers' six pre-Accession games.
At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-tune games to get ready.
Trump's arrest time in West Virginia, Yotiv Channel
President Donald Trump has opened up the floor of night arrest in Wiling, the Virginia system.
This is the first of five planned tramp arrests this week, including arrests in friendly places such as Tensey and Messypi.
While voting for his appointment to the Supreme Court, Trump was seeking to build support for the upcoming mid-election election, because the Republicans were in danger of losing control of Congress after the election in November.
What time is there for Trump's arrest in West Virginia tonight and how is it seen on the Internet?
The arrest of Trump in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 1900 by the East Coast clock on September 29, 2018.
We can expect a tram arrest in West Virginia on the Internet on direct flow in Botswana.
Trump is likely to be referring to the hearings that were held this week for the Supreme Court of Burt Kwano, and has become a coroner of charges of inappropriate sexual behavior and thus of voting in St. Vincent's vote last week while the FBI is investigating the charges.
But the main goal of this stopper is to help Republicans who are in front of challenging elections in November to get some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's election headquarters said that the goal of these five arrests next week is to train volunteers and support as the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in St. Petersburg and the House of Representatives.
Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda, until the President is ready to visit as many countries as possible with the entrance to the vast election season, he said that he was speaking to the Trump campaign that he asked to stay anonymously there.
Tonight's arrest, which is planned to be held at the Wesbanko Forum in Willing, can bring support from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw media coverage from the Pittsburgh press to the West Virginia metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump is visiting West Virginia, the country where he won over 40 percent in 2016.
Trump's trying to help the Republican candidate to St. Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who's in the polls.
It's not a good sign for Morrisy that the president should come to try to improve his situation in the polls.
Ryder Cup 2018: Aura'b team shows the right to fight to keep hope for the only games on Sunday
After three single-sided centrifuges, the fourth games on Sunday, tt are maybe exactly what the Ryder Cup needs.
Momentum's motor-motor is a highly available sport idea, but the players really believe in it, and never more than in competitions like this one.
So where do they think we're gonna find the momentum now?
They've had the advantage of six points, and now it's four, so you can see it's a little momentum.
Of course, Europe is at the top of four points with 12 more in the game.
However, the Americans, as they say Spanish, feel that they have a little spirit in the sails, and they have a lot to cheer up, and not the last ones that they're in the form of a ship and Stan Thomas who play together all day and each of them manage at three points out of four.
Speth has been a deadly hot-to-green leader in a personal example.
The joy alarms were strengthened as his turn continued, when he's drowning critical Pat to win the four-square game and Thomas went down two after two.
His pet that won the 15on game won a similar alarm, the kind he seems to believe the American team still has hope.
Indeed, we only need to dig deep and look after just about your own game.
That's all that's left for each of these players to do.
18 naked to keep a signature.
The only players with more map points and Thomas during the last two days are Francisco Molinery and Tommy Peltowood, the lead story of the Ryder Cup.
The weird side, but the charming ones, of Europe are four out of four and gain the affection of everyone.
Mollywood was the only one who didn't hit the device on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back on Friday morning.
The same round, and the way that their energy appears to flow to and from the eager audience, is based on the fact that they're the players who win on Sunday, and there's no more popular player than St. Hollywood or Molinary to sign the European potential victory with the sun sitting on the golf field Le Golf National.
They'd both be at the same time in different continents.
However, it's too early to talk about European fame.
A doll and Thompson Webb Simpson finished with Sergeo Garcia, a hero of the four bullets of the morning, when he was robbed with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles in the front nine took the Spanishs and the bandits to the hole they didn't come any closer to get out of him.
However, on Sunday there's no one to help you get out of the hole.
It's fascinating to look closely at the four bullets and Wednesdays because of the interactions between the sides, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change as an eye.
Europe has played a lot better as a group so far and significantly within the last day, but this fourth senate has shown that the American team is filled with the spirit of a battle that parted, mainly within the U.S., to question it.
Europe leads 10-6 towards the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is in a healthy baron for the last day of the Ryder Cup after completing the four-ball and four-week games on Saturday 10-6 against U.S.A.
The full inspiration of Tommy Plutowood and Verensco Molinari led the two-winning turn on Tiger Woods, and has so far raised the gap in Le Golf National to four points.
The European side players of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to protect the hill lost in Hiztalin two years ago, controlled against the Americans who missed the four ball games this morning, and brought the series to 3-1.
The American players showed a lot more opposition to the four games, and they won two games, but they couldn't close the gap.
To keep holding the cup, the friends of the Forrick Sea need eight of the 12 single games.
Plytowood is the first European triocene to win four points in the sequence, while Mollinari, who won Mollwood's title - after an extraordinary weekend, they're just the second to win four of their four opening games in Ryder Cup's history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the games of the four bullets, they continued in a wonderful harmony together to defeat the weak Woods and the American rooky Bryson d'Chambau as a result of an even greater level of five and four.
Woods, who dragged himself over two games on Saturday, showed random outbreaks of greatness, but so far he lost 19 out of the 29 games of the four bullets and fours, and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who died during this morning's four-ball games, came back to join Henry Stanson in the fourth games to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brux Cochka, the world's first and third.
However, not all of it went easy for European players in the moving weather and the soft wind that was sitting south of Paris.
The bright winner, Jordan Speth, and Stine Thomas, put the leprous for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a rule 2 and 1 on John Rem Scissor and Ian Fullter in the four-ball games and returned later to defeat Fletter and Vera McLeroy 4 and 3 in the fourth games, after they lost the first two waves.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup team back from a negative four-point gap to the only games, though as the holder in the cup, Forrick's people just need to hold the cup.
However, after two days in second place, it seems that an attack against Sunday is beyond their ability.
North Korea says that \"nobody's way\" is not going to break off a single-sided weapon without trust.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea announced on Saturday in the morning that the continued sanctions would deepen her disbelief in the United States and that there is no way for the country to give up its nuclear weapon in a unilateral manner under these circumstances.
Ry Young Ho was informed at the annual U.S. General Meeting that North Korea was committed to making a significant good will, a year that passed, such as the cessation of nuclear missile experiments, the development of the nuclear testing site and the commitment not to develop further nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
But we don't see any corresponding reaction from the U.S. he said.
We can't be sure about our national defences and under such conditions in any way, and we won't first unbundle ourselves in a single-sided nuclear weapon.
While Sherry has returned to North Korea's known complaints about the U.S. opposition to a nuclear explosion that North Korea would be exonerated by taking steps, his statement seems to be important by not rejecting the risk of nuclear explosion, as she has done in the past.
Ree referred to a joint announcement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between an American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim committed to act for a nuclear explosion of half the Korean island, while Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea asked for an official end to the Korean War, which ended in 1950-1953, but U.S.A. said that North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapon.
The U.S. also opposed readings to reduce international sanctions on North Korea.
Irrab insists on first nuclear explosion and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goal in the way of coercion, even resisting the announcement of the end of the war.
The perception that sanctions can cause us to kneel is a dream in the speculation of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is, suicides deepen our trust
Ree did not even mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which highlighted the President of the U.S. in his speech earlier in the week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader, Moon Jaya-in in the last five months, adding:
However, Rey's death was dramatically different from last year's, so he told the General Meeting of the United Nations that the land attack on North Korea's missiles was inevitable after Mr. President Trump called Kim \"Rocket Man\" on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump, who threatened the total destruction of North Korea, commended Kim for his courage in taking steps to unload a weapon, but said that there was still a lot of work to do and that sanctions must remain in the world until North Korea's nuclear launch.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, and added that if it took two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia claimed that the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for steps taken.
However, the Secretary of State of the U.S. Security Council, Mike Pompau, said to the UN Security Council on Thursday:
The Security Council has been supporting one here with imposing sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding of its ballistic missile and nuclear plans.
Pompau met with Ree at the UN General Meeting, and said later that he would visit Fongyang again next month to prepare the next summit.
Pompau has been visiting this year three times in North Korea, but his last visit did not go well.
He left E Pyongyang in July saying that progress was made, but a few hours later North Korea protected him for putting Gangster's demands on him.
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to separate a missile site as well as a nuclear facility, if U.S.
He said that Kim told him that “the same steps ” that he was interested in include security assurances that there was a Trump liability in Singapore, as well as changes in the direction of normalization of the relationship with Washington.
Graduates at Harvard are taking a course on how to rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year teaches its participants how to sleep more, to try to fight the expanded mech culture of learning by staying awake all night with caffeine.
A academic study found that students at the university number one in the world often have no idea about the basic principles of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Cassisler, professor of sleepology at Harvard Medical School and expert at the Bragham and Weimnes Hospital, planned the course, which he took as his first example.
He was inspired to open the course after the lecture on the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
At the end of the talk, one girl approached me and said: ‘ Why are you telling me this just now, in my last school year? ’
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleeping -- what she surprised me -- he said to the phone.
The course, which goes on for the first time this year, explains to students the principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances, and also improve their general condition.
Paul Briera, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Senior Director of the University Health Services, said that the university decided to open the course after she discovered that students had suffered from a severe sleep shortage during the week.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive missions.
In one part, a picture of a room in the dormitories, where students are clicking on cupboards, curtains, sports clothes and books, to get to the points of the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performances are affected by a lack of sleep, as well as the importance of going to sleep routine.
In some cases, it is suggested that participants should be aware of how persistent insomnia can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
After that, the campus map, if interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their day-to-day routine.
We know it won't change students' behavior overnight.
But we believe that they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes - added Professor Stysler.
He spoke of a culture of pride over sleepless nightbreak and added that modern technology and pressure on students are increasing.
Care for adequate sleep, and good sleep, each student's secret weapon must be to fight stress, despair and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation transfers the brain to hunger, so we're hungry all the time.
Raymond Soo, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemistry and physics, helped Professor Chissler design the course, after participating in one of his first years in Harvard.
He said that the course lit up his eyes and moved him to encourage a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all students to prepare for a similar instruction program before joining the competition institution.
Professor said that students were advised to check the possibility of targeting a watch when it was time to go to bed, not just for the time to wake up, and to be cities for the harmful effects of a blue light that politicians agree on electronics and LED lighting, which could break the surface rate and cause problems in the atmosphere.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: A gate of a mango is critical to Jared's players.
Herng's Spgo's another attack of loss in the game except when Dolly Manga caused Steven Jarard's rebel players to defeat 1-0 in Livingston.
The AIBOX players were hoping to achieve their first win in the game, except for February 1-4 in February in St. Johnson, but Gary Holt's group led to the loss of only the second of Jared in 18 games as a manager and left the team behind eight points after the Hets group headed by the Scotian Supreme League.
A manga attacked seven minutes before the half, and it didn't seem that Herring's uninformed players would be worth it.
While Herng's now landing to the sixth place, Livingstone climbs to the third place and right after Hibrenyan in the separation of the gate.
And it may be waiting for Rang's further duplication after Cone Calum Spence needed a head injury after an object was probably thrown out of the proposal.
Jared valued eight swaps in a group that passed through air to half the finals in a cup in a Fred.
Holt, on the other hand, came up with the same 11 Livingstone players that took a point from Hartz last week, and he could have had seven satisfactions with the way his players put the rivals in the blame.
Herring'S may have ruled over the holding of the ball, but Livingstone did more with the ball they had.
They almost caught up in the second minute when Manga sent a bullet to Scott Patman to the bottom of Alan McGarrell's gate, but the middle-field player kicked the ball too far.
Then Kagan Jacob found Captain Craig Alekt, but his shield for Allen Leigh could only kick out of the Cora.
Herring'Rs did take control, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the last three.
Alfredo Murlos certainly thought he had to rule in his favor a crime after a quarter of an hour, when he and Steven Wills were convulsed, but Judge Steven Thomson had the landscape against the fallout of the Colombian player.
Herring's only been able to kick twice to the front gate in the first half, but the gate of Averys Liam Kelly has easy to blow out of Santa Colibal and the weak kick of Obi Agreya.
While Livingstone's opening in the 34th minute was contrary to how the game was conducted, no one would deny that they deserved at least their hard work.
Herring's failed to deal with Jacobs' deep free ball again.
Scott Artfield didn't respond while Declan Gallagher transferred the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept a cool on moving to a turf for a simple finish.
Gérard did a half-action when Collibly replaced with Ryan Kent, and the trade led to almost an immediate effect when the decompositions/breeds dropped a ball to Morlos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingstone continued to force the guest group to play exactly the type of game she liked, when Lith-Guy and Lacket continue to send long bullets.
Holt's team could have increased the lead at the other stages, but McGegor was well placed to prevent Jacobs' experience before he was taken off the corner.
The Herng's replacement player Glenn Middleton was later a further claim for a transfer to Jacobs, but Thomason disappeared again.
Alma: Mouna Gager
And now stand by the Alman of September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and continue... the day on which the future physicist Johns and William, Hans, was born in Germany.
Geer developed a method that allows identification and a measure of radioactivity, which eventually led to a device known as Mona Geger.
Since 1950, the device has become a broker in science, but it also became a pillar in pop culture because of the film - Bells of Coronado, where Roy Roger and Dale Evans set up as two weird mornings/scientifics:
Man: What the hell is this thing?
It's Mona Geger, which is used to trace radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put together your headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the radiologicals on the atoms in the minerals.
Evans: Oh, my God, it's really bombing right now!
Hans-Gager died in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that carries his name continues to live after him.
A new vaccine for cancer can teach the immune system
A new vaccine for cancer can teach the immune system to see - cancer cells and eliminate them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells as part of treatment.
The method includes extracting vaccine cells from the patient, and changing the lab cells.
Then cells can see a protein that shares many types of cancer, and then they freaks back to the patient.
A experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman who has been treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to detect cancer cells, the cancer of the disease has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of vaccine cells from the patient, the replacement of the lab cells so that they can see a protein called HER2 that is associated with many cancers, and then the injection of cells back to the patient.
Professor J. Brzofsky, U.S. National Institute of Cancer in Batesda, Maryland, said: \"Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 stimulates the development of multiple cancers, including breast cancer, splenic, and osteoarthritis, it was explained by Professor Brazofsky.
A similar approach to taking vaccine cells from patients and teaching them the same way to attack cancer cells has been successful in treating a type of cancer.
Kenya West broke into a statement supporting Trump, with his head a MAGA hat, after his appearance at SNL.
It wasn't received in a beautiful eye.
Kenya West responded to the call of Bos in the studio during a confused performance on the Christary Nate Love show, while he praised the president of Ara, Donald Trump, who said he would run for president in 2020.
After carrying out his third song on the show, called August Town, which during the course of a six-year-old Hat Make America Great, he broke up in a protest against the Democrats and returned his support in Trump.
So many times I talk to white people who say, \"How can you love Trump, he's racist?\"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd leave America a long time ago.
SNL's episode began with a combination of Matt Damon's cage, where the Hollywood star praised Bert Kovano's testimony to the Senate's Legal Committee, for the charges of a sexual assault brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the evidence was not broadcast on the show, the thing was raised to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not obvious if Rock tried to roll on West in advertising the thing.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had taken a backstage review of the hat he was wearing.
They attacked me behind the scenes.
They said, \"Don't go out on the stage with this hat on your head.\"
They attacked me!
And then they said I was in a dark place - he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on and said, \"You want to see the dark place?\" He said he was wearing my Superman hat, because it means nobody can tell me what to do.
Try to show love
His words had been read at least twice by the audience, and it seemed that SNL team members were embarrassed, Variety reported, and one of them said to the press: \"The silence of my childhood fell in the whole studio.\"
West is on the program as a last minute change, instead of the Aryana Grande singer, a former mate, Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
A lot of them when he performed the song I love it when he's dressed as Perrier bottle.
West has received backup from the head of the TUSA conservative team, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: \"Thank you for not giving up to the crowd.\"
But submitting the Attua program, Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter West just being who he is, and it's totally wonderful.
But I chose not to reward (by acquiring the music or his betraying or supporting his art) that I thought I had an effort and spread an ideology that would harm my community.
He's free.
And so are we - she added.
Before the show, Harper announced to Twitter that he had changed his name, and said that now he's the community that used to be known as buying West.
He's not the first artist to change his name and go after Deedy's, also known as Puff Deed, Puffy and P-deddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Doc, held the name Snoop Leon, and of course, the musician who known Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to a former artist as Prince.
A charge for attempted murder following a stab at a restaurant in Blept.
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Blept on Friday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Billah.
The suspect is expected to appear in front of Belfest's court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
The show star is playing the throne, Keith Harrington, attacking the toxic men.
Kit Rinton is known as a snow-slide of the swords from the series of violent marine-breathing fantasy.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the Hachou hero's strategist, saying that those posts on the screen often give young children the message they must be tough to respect.
In an interview with Sounday Times Culture, Keith said he thought that he thought that something went wrong and wondered how to deal with the problem of bad men in #MeToo.
Keith, who recently married another star at the throne games, and Rose Leslie, who was 31 years old, admitted that he was “very troubled” about this kind of treatment.
Personally, I feel very troubled right now-- where have we been wrong on the way about men?
What do we teach men during their growing period from the point of view of the problem we now witness to?
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic women due to the very male personalities she shows.
He went on to say, \"What comes from inside and what's learned from the outside?
What do we learn from TV, and on the street, that makes young children feel they have to be on this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time -- how does it change?
Because there is no doubt that something went wrong for young men.
In an interview he admitted that he wouldn't be participating in any of the ongoing series or a derivative series of customs games after the end of the series next summer, saying that he ended up with the fields of battle and horses.
Starting in November Keith will re-wrap up the play of Sam Sheppard in a real Wester, telling the story of a film producer and his bandit brother.
The player recently found out that he saw his wife Rose as the best thing that happened as a result of the throne games.
I met my wife in a fine manner, so in this way he gave me my future family, and my life from that moment forward.
Rose played the role of Yigrit, the name of John Snow's love, the fantasy list winning the Emmy Prize.
We got married in June 2018 at the house of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% rise in new cases
China has declared a 14% break in a number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are sick in the disease, so they gave up official health care.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been infected as a result of having sex, which is a change to the past.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in certain parts of China as a result of infected blood samples.
But the number of people infected with HIV this way has been reduced to almost zero, according to official health agents in China at the Union Conference in Junon County.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 a year.
HIV infection as a result of having sex is a burning problem in China's hot community.
Homosexualism was banned in China in 1997, but it's said that the tendency against people to be violent is wide.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of the men who had sex with men would eventually marry women.
Many of the infections of the disease are due to insufficient protective use in these sex relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has guaranteed universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a man of her team leaked information about a Republican senator and defended the dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
The American Senator Maxine Waters rejected on Saturday the charges that a member of her team had published personal information about three American senators on the senator's Wikipedia pages.
Democratic Senator from Los Angeles appreciated that the claims are distributed by websites and by extreme right-wing visitors.
Lies, lies, and other lies are absconding. Waters said in a Twitter announcement.
According to the reports, the information published by the residence addresses and phone numbers of the American Senators Lyndsey is from south Carolina, Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both of them from Utah.
The information was posted on the Internet on Thursday, and published by an unknown man on Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate Committee on Indictable Sexual Conducts against the Supreme Court judge, Brett Kwano.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators asked Kovano.
_BAR_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This groundless accusation is totally wrong and a total lie, added Waters.
My team member -- his identity and personal details were revealed and his security was damaged as a result of these false accusations and mistakes -- was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This baseless guilt is totally wrong and a total lie
Waters' announcement was quickly launched on the Internet, including from the former Secretary of the White House Ari Flysher.
It's an angry denial. Flysher's reporter.
The thing indicates that she has the temper that requires Congressmen.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he can't respond to anger.
He's not allowed to respond to the tragedy.
He can't doubt the accusations of the accused.
He must be calm and “slow to anger ”
Flyer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the review of the Democrats on Judge Kovano, who accused visitors who seemed too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Umar Novaro, a Republican candidate trying to defeat Waters in the mid-term election, also raised his thoughts on Twitter.
Big if that's the truth. He wrote twitter.
In her announcement, Waters said that she was deprived of access to the appropriate authorities and to the legal enforcement of these lies.
We'll make sure that the criminals find out she's attracted, and they'll stand trial for all their destructive and dangerous actions towards my team members.
Review of the film Johnny Ingleish 3.0' - a weak spy prodigious in the wake of Rowan Atkinson
It is acceptable today to look for meanings about the Barczit in every new film with a British perspective, and it does seem to fit this life of the action-commethics series Johnny Ingleish, which started out there in 2003 with Johnny Inglesh and woke up back to life in 2011 with Johnny Ingleish returning.
Is an ironic self-station on how much we're worth nothing going to become our country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the same Johnny Inglesh, who has an open eye and a rubber face, has been given another opportunity to spoil things -- and his name is more than that of a wide-ranging global piece of film view in non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, he's the stupid English agent, who, despite his strange facial position to the bright light, looked a little like Clouso, a little Master between and a lot of this guy who contributed alone to the fire complex taste in the opening text of the London Olympics in 2012.
It is also originally based on the mysterious international passenger atkinson in the forgotten television commercials of Barclycard, who has a chaos behind him.
There's one minute or two nice in the last edition of Johnny Ingleish.
I liked the thing that Johnny Inglesh was getting close to a helicopter when he was wearing a middle-aged armor, and my impulse heart was ringing for moments about his helmet.
Atkinson exhibits its local physical capabilities, but humor feels rather weak and strange, especially since the \"dragon\" type of spy films are like 007 and an impossible task in itself now includes a comedy component.
Humor feels like he's going to children instead of adults, and for the adventures of Johnny Inglesh's crazy failings are less brilliant and focused than the jokes of Atkinson's dream movie character.
The rise of the film begins when a great danger threatens Britain.
Computers hacked a room for the British spy's super secret network and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, for the head agent's anxiety -- a unfortunately small role for Kevin Aldon.
It's the last straw for a head of government in a arrogant and hostile character, who has already suffered from the total collapse of a political politicist father: Emma Thompson is doing her best to play the role of Teresa Mae, but she has nothing to do with what to work with the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since any active spy is exposed, she'll have to bring someone back from the trap.
And this means Johnny Inglesh, who is in honor of himself, now employed as a high school manager at a high school, but gives unofficial lessons in how to be a undercover spy: some good jokes here, when Inglish offers an Academy of School Rocking.
Ingleish was brought back to Whithall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former assistant to M.M. Buff, who was playing again at Miller's.
Buff is now a man married to a military commander, in the role of a annoying class queen who will have a little bit of a dissipated Vico Paparin.
So Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's secret service service to a terrible complex is back in action, with a beautiful pam-patall in a pale image with the same oligod of Olega Corilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling under the magic of billionaires of christian technology claiming that he can solve the computer problems of Britain - the evil Jason Volta of Jake Lacey's age.
Ingleish and Boff begin in their audiosa that is more than a piece of two clowns: under the cover of waiters, they're on fire at a fancy French restaurant; they create an endomesia when they smuggle themselves into the fancy yacht of Valetta; and Inglich from a complete anarchy in our attempt to use a similar reality system to learn to know the inner structure of Valetta's home.
Of course, all efforts are being made to lead to the last sequence, but despite affections and prejudices, it has a sense of TV for children.
Pretty medium level.
And like the other Johnny Inglesh movies, I couldn't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice with his talent?
The Leabur Party denies that she's making a plan for the British to work four days a week but to get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbin's libor party is considering an alternative program that the British will work four days a week -- but they'll get paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants company managers to transfer the savings as a result of the AI's artificial intelligence revolution to the workers as another day off.
I mean, employees will have a three-day weekend, and they'll still get the same pay.
Sources said that the idea would fit the company's economic culture and its plans to guide the country for the benefit of the employees.
The Congress of Professional Associations supports a four-day work week in a way that employees can enjoy the changes in the economy.
A senior source at the libor party said to Sandy Times: policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but this four-day working week is where it fits the party's approach to the re-evaluation of the economy for employees, and also for the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party called for a four-day job week during its general election in 2017.
However, the ambition is not supported right now by the Labour Party as a whole.
\"A four-day job week isn't a policy of the party and the party doesn't consider it\"
The Leaver candidate for the treasure minister, John McDonal, took advantage of the party conference last week to put his vision into a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to gain power back from 'faceless managers' and 'pricers' in service companies.
The candidate for the minister of the treasure is also determined that it may and may be possible for current owners of water companies to pay back their full investment because the Labour Government may “encourage” on the basis of the discovery of inappropriate behaviour.
It also confirms that there are plans for the introduction of company board workers and the creation of \"college radiation\" to transfer 10% of the capital of companies in the private sector to the employees who will be admitted to a two-year divididation box of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told TV 60 minutes if the FBI's investigation of our hope would change their mind.
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Bert Kwano has suspended the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court at least a week, and raises the question whether the findings of the investigation can convince the Republicans to withdraw their support.
On Sunday, on the 60-minute show, Scott said he asked Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their mind.
Looks like Kennedy was more open than his colleague to the South Carolina party.
I mean, of course, he said Kennedy.
I said to the hearing, I said I talked to Judge Kovano.
I called him after it happened, that the charge came up, and I said, \"Did you do it?\"
He was determined, determined, completely.
It seems, however, that Graham's vote was in the rock.
I've already decided about Bert Kwano and there's gonna be a need for a broken charge.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Burt firmly denied it, added Graham, in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
And no man she mentioned could verify it.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see how something can change
What is the world's civilian festival and does it contribute anything to the reduction of poverty?
The New York Saturday will extend the World's Citizens' Festival, an annual music event with the most impressive list of stars that will appear and an even smaller target of an end to poverty in the world.
The world's civilian festival, which exists this seventh time, will bring to it tens of thousands of people who will have been trained in Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mends, but also to increase the ads to the real cause of the event - putting an end to extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Civil Festival, which began in 2012, is the continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to put an end to poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (except if they are willing to pay for the VIP card), the concert island must complete a series of tasks, or actions, such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, calling or other significant ways to help increase the ads for an end to poverty.
But how successful did the festival really get when only 12 years ahead of him achieve his goal?
Is the idea of giving a free ticket to a concert for people really a way to convince them to require a call for action, or is it another case of clictivism - people who feel like they're really affecting by signing a giant on the Internet or sending a view on Twitter?
Since 2011, the world's citizens' organization has reported more than 19 million actions, supported by its supporters, at the root of a variety of different goals.
These actions helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth over $37 billion that would affect their lives of more than 2.5 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group set out 390 commitments and announced as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already begun with the distribution or disbursement of funds.
The Group estimates that so far the projected funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, British investors' partners and committed actors to help children grow up to their potential - and promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end nutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 bells from the world's citizens.
With support from the Government of Britain, donors, national governments and “nationals of the world” like you, we can make social justice in the subject of sub-food for a regional assessment in history - said that the Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition Trici Ulman to the audience during the London live concert in April 2018.
The group also said that, having done more than 5,000 actions called Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the pace of the project, Power of Nutrition, to reach 5 million women and children with nutrition intervention.
In response to one of their common questions on their web site, what makes you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?
The world's citizens have responded: it's gonna be a long, difficult path - sometimes falling down and failing.
But, like the great movements ahead of us of civil rights and resistance to Parthead, we will succeed, because we're stronger together.
Kent Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mends, Creddy B and Daniel Mouna are among some of the events that were held at the New York New York year's event, to be served by Bee-Li Forens and V.K.K.
U.S. could use the Navy for the purpose of delaying Russian energy exports -- the Minister of the Interior.
When needed, Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy access to markets, including the Middle East, discovered American Home Secretary Ryan Zink, as quoted at Washington Examiner.
Zink claimed that the Russian engagement in Syria - made, important to mention, in the order of the legal government - would lead to the spread of new energy markets.
I believe that the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to broker energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe, he said according to the report.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with it.
The United States is able, with our fleet, to make sure that the sea routes are open and when a siege is needed to make sure that their energy sources do not reach the market.
Zinky pointed out to audiences at a Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the voice of the energy manufacturers in the U.S.
He continued to speak and compare Washington’s attitudes to dealing with Russia and Iran, and he pointed out that they were indeed identity.
The economic possibility for Iran and Russia is, more or less, a leverage and exchange of fuels, he said, referring to Russia as a pony of one trick, since the economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come while the Trump government has gone on a mission to increase its demanding natural gas export to Europe, replacing Russian energy sources, which are much cheaper for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of the government of Trump, including the President of Arrab, Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to cancel its participation in the inappropriate pipeline project, which, according to Trump's words, has turned Berlin into Moscow's exile.
Moscow has often stressed that the 11 billion dollars pipeline project, which is supposed to double the capacity of the current pipe to 110 billion, is a financial project only.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's strict resistance to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of an unfair competition.
I believe that we partners think that energy can't be a tool for pressuring and consumers should be able to choose the suppliers. He said the Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting in Moscow with the U.S. Secretary for Energy Affairs of U.A., Rick Perry, in September.
The U.S. position won an anti-terrorism response from Germany, re-establishing its commitment to the project.
The German Industry Organization (BDI), the leading organization in the German industrial sector, called on Larab to keep away from the energy policy of the European Union and the two-sided agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply.
Elizabeth Warren seriously considered the run for President in 2020, said Senator from Massachusetts.
The Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday that she would seriously consider the possibility of running for presidents after the mid-cedence elections.
Warren confirmed his intention to run for President during a meeting in Holeok, Massachusetts.
It's time for women to get to Washington to fix our broken government, and that's why a woman needs to be in the head, she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I'll seriously consider the race for president.
Warren expressed her opinion of President Donald Trump during the town meeting, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
I'm worried to my bone demon about what Donald Trump does to our democracy. She said.
Warren visited Trump for the appointment of Bert Kovano as High Court judge.
In a peek published on Friday, Warren said, of course, we need an investigation of the FBI before the vote.
However, a survey published on the day of the “Warn’s own choice” showed that most of Warren’s own choice did not think it should run for the 2020 elections.
Fifty-eight percent of potential voters in Schutz said that the senator should not run for the election, according to a survey by the Safok University Political Research Centre and the Boston Global Journal.
Thirty-two percent supported the intention of dealing with the presidents of the senator.
The survey showed that there was much more support for former governor Deval Patrick's murder, with 38% supporting his run against 48% opposed to her.
Persecuted figures from the democratic party fated in the context of possible responses to the 2020 elections include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Mormont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said that he would make an official decision in January, according to A.P. reports.
Sarah Peylin mentions the post-traumatic stress disorder of Trac Pillen at Donald Trump's arrest.
The 26-year-old Trac Pylin was in Iraq for a year after he joined the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with the incident of family violence on the night of the night.
What's going on with my son, what he's been through since he came back, allows me to identify with families that experience the effects of the PTSD disorder and some of the injuries that our troops are returning to - she told the audience participating in the arrest for Donald Trump in the town of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pauline called the Phil in the room and said about her son and other loose soldiers, which are slightly different returns, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if what we gave to their troops and airmen in the country, and all the other military men, is honorable.
He was arrested on a day in the city of Wesilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, disrupting the report of the case of domestic violence and holding arms under a license, according to Dan Bennet, speaking to the Wesilla police.
18 countries and the District of Colombia are supporting the challenge of the new state shelter policy.
Eighteen countries and the District of Colombia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policies that refuse to provide shelter to fugitive victims from situations where gang violence or family violence are involved.
Representatives from the 18 states and District Milo made a court friend statement in Washington on the day of the day and the day of the day in which the challenge was to support the policy call on the asylum seekers, according to NBC report.
The complainant's full name in the Grace v. Cushens case, which filed the American Civil Rights Association in August, was not exposed.
She said that her son and his violent sons, friends in the gang, abused her but formally in the U.S. government rejected her request for shelter on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace's state defenders described the countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have many applications for state shelter in the U.S., as nations facing many problems with respect to gangs and family violence.
Ariab's new political shelter policy cancelled a decision from 2014 of the BIA Council to allow immigrants without certificates from family violence situations to apply for a state shelter.
The Attorney General of Columbia County, Carl Resen, said in a statement on the sixth day that the new policy ignored dozens of years of state, federal and international laws.
The Federal Law requires that all discussions on the request for State asylum be based on the particular facts and circumstances of the request, and the new policy-based barrier violates this principle.
The lawyers also argued with a statement that the policy, preventing the entry of immigrants, is affecting the economy of the U.S., because they tend to become autistic and to provide a necessary job for their words.
General Attorney-General Jeff Schens ordered immigration judges not to give more than one State shelter to victims from family abuse and gang violence in June.
The State shelter is open to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of ethnic, religious, nation or membership in a specific social group or political opinion.
The purpose of the State shelter would never have been easy for all the problems -- not even for all the harsh problems -- where people stand every day around the world.
The rescue efforts are desperate in Pallo, while the killers are humiliated, in the rescue race for survivors.
For survivors, it's become harder than a moment.
There's a very tense feeling. Risa Cosoma, 35 years old, and if a burning baby is in the middle of the valley in Pallo, the devastated city.
Every moment the ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is rare
The inhabitants seemed to return to their devastated homes, scattered among screeching objects, trying to save everything they've found.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged by the earthquake at 7.5, were flooded.
Some of the wounded, including David Harris, who suffered fractures in the back and shoulder, lying outside Palo's military hospital, where they received treatment because of a strong concussion that continued after the earthquake.
The tears filled his eyes when he told how he felt the violent earthquake shocked the hotel room on the fifth floor that shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the wall debris, I think, saying Harris to the AP, adding that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then she bled.
I don't know what happened to her and my girl.
I hope they're in a safe place.
Ambassador Ariab blames China for 'breeds' with `greeds'
A week after the official Chinese paper published a four-page ad in the American Union, while aggressively promoting the advantages of trade between the U.S. and China, the American ambassador in China accused Biging of using the American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump, on the last fourth day, referred to the payment supplement of the Chinese newspaper ‘Cina Daily’, Da Moine Regster - the most famous newspaper in the state of Eva - who accused China of trying to intervene in the election of the American Congress on 6 November, claiming that China had been rejected.
The accusation of Trump of China tried to interfere with the election in the U.S., marking a new stage, according to official sources in the U.S., on the Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
Although natural governments of foreign origin are going to publish awareness of the development of trade, Big’ing Washington is now stuck in a Goa trade war where every country is up and compared to the customs classes on products brought up by its enemies.
The customs officers, who China has taken advantage at the early stage of the war of trade, were meant to hurt exports from countries such as Eva who supported the Republic Party of Trump, said American and Chinese experts.
Terry Bernstad, former governor of IVA for many years, and an important export of Chinese commercial goods, said that Big'ing has hit employees, farmers and business.
China, Barnstad wrote an article in the Day One edition of De Moine Regster, which strengthens the brilliant acts by publishing ads in our free press.
In its propaganda bombing, the Chinese government uses America's precious freedom of speech and press tradition, and adverts a fee advert in De Moin Regster.
And, against the stand of the newspapers on the Baying streets, you will find little resistance voices and you will not see any true reflections that are of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on the worrying economic path, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that “one of China's bouts has been avoiding the offer to publish, even though it has not been mentioned in some newspaper.
The Republican Party extends the voices of women before the mid-cadence election with the Kovano incident, warning analysts
While many of the leaders of the Republican Party stand by the candidate for the Supreme Court of Burt Kwano and defend him against a number of charges of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see a response against, especially women, during the next mid-Catheden elections.
The feelings about the matter were especially alive, and most Republicans formally protest their desire to move forward with the voting process.
This kind of thing cannot be returned to the back. Grant Riher said, a professor of state science at the University of Cyrus University School for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Riher said he was questioning the fact that Senator Jeff Fleek's last-minute efforts (from the Republican Party in Arizona) to open the FBI's investigation will suffice to vote angry.
Women are not about to forget what happened yesterday -- they are not about to forget it tomorrow and not November -- said on the day Karin Z'an-Pierre, a senior counsellor and national speaker of the MoveOn movement, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
In the morning of the sixth day, protestors called November! When we showed up in the Senate, while the Republicans control the Senate's court board chose to continue promoting the appointment of Kovano, despite Dr. Christine Blaise Ford's testimony, according to a report from the Mic website.
The levels of enthusiasm and democratic motivation will break new records, telling Stu Rotenberg, a non-participative political analyst.
People say they were already high; they're right.
But they can be even higher, especially in the open voices of women in perfection and in the battle of young voters, between 18 and 29, who, despite their lack of sympathy for the president, are often prevented from voting.
Even before Ford's public witness, who broke down her charges of sexual assault of the candidate for the High Court, the analysts claimed that you might have a reaction to whether the Republicans would continue to promote the authorization of the appointment.
The appointment caused the Republicans to become a serious complicator. Michael Steele, former National Republical Commission, at the beginning of last week, reported the NBC News Channel.
It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote or whether Kovano gets the appointment, but also the way the Republicans handled it and the way they acted. He pointed out to the G. Cecil news channel, Director Priorities USA, the group assisting in the selection of democracy.
Yet, it seems that the Americans were somewhat different about their belief in the immortality of Ford and Quano, with a slightly higher support for Ford.
A recent survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed in or likely to testify to Ford, while 35 percent said that they believed in certainty or likely to have a kwano.
In addition, 38% said they thought we were lying for sure or likely during his testimony, while only 30% said it about Ford.
After the pressure from FBI, the FBI is currently investigating the charges raised by Ford and also the charges raised by at least one more complainant, Deborah Ramírez, according to the Guardian's reports.
Ford testified in a oath before the Senate's Legal Committee last week that he was convicted of being drunk when she was 17.
Remírez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court exposed Aber to her face during a party at Yale University school in the 1980s.
Global Global Internet createer plans to start a new Internet network to beat Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Li, a global global Internet developer, from the start-up company launch to the Facebook, Amazon and Google competition.
Inrupt, the last project of the man who became a legend in the technology world, is a company that develops Solid, Berners-Li's Open Code Platform.
Solid platform allows users to choose where they will store their data and who are allowed to access the different types of data.
In an interview without the Fast Company, Berners-Li joked about what means behind Inrupt is world control.
We have to do this now. He said about the start-up.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create a personal online database or PDO.
The portal can include a list of contacts, lists of actions to perform, timetable, library of music and other personal and professional instruments.
Imagine that Google Drive, Microsoft Autaluk, Selak and Suppy will all be available in one browser at a time.
What specializes the online database is that only the user decides who can access the information and what kind of information can be accessed.
The Society calls it “personally powerful by means of data ”
According to John Bruce, the executive of society, the purpose is that Inrupt will find the appropriate resources, process and abilities to assist solidization for all.
Today, the company includes Berners-Li, Bruce, a security platform purchased by the IBM, a team of several keys hired to work on the project, and a community of voluntary codes programming.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create scattered apps using the available tools on Inrupt's web site.
Bernards Lee said that he and his team were not discussing Facebook and Google about their agreement or their refusal to make a total change, which would make it a complete and nightfall in all their business models.
We're not asking them for permission.
On Saturday's Post, Berners-Li wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an environmental system to help protect the integrity and quality of the new solid network.
In 1994, Berners-Li changed the Internet face when he set up the network's installation organization, W3C at the Messchetz Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners Lee was a voice that had an influence on the network's neutrality.
Also during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Li will continue to serve as the founder and director of the W3C organization, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
I'm particularly optimistic about the next age of the network.
Bernard Van: An event to observe the religious man who won Victoria's cross in World War I
The only religion of the English Church that won, as they were, the cross of Victoria during the first world war was seen at an event in his hometown, 100 years after his victory.
Vice-President Bernard Van, won the Victoria Cross on September 29, 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had the highest British honours.
The stone of victory was exposed by two of his grandchildren, in a parade held in the head of the state of North Hamton, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said that the exposure of the stone was exactly 100 after his grandfather won the honours is a wonderful removable.
According to the London Gazt newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Deputy champion Van led his regiment and crossed the San Kent hill through heavy fog and under heavy fire from field guns and two guns.
Then he rushed to the fire line and the Greatest Abbeys, leading the line ahead before he was forced to take one hand on the subsoil and dropped three of the company.
Lieutenant champion Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 -- one month before the war ended.
Michael Van Ben-72, said his grandfather's actions were something I know I can never compare to, but something that makes me humble.
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also assumed a stranger after the march, which led to the Royal Youth League of Brentwood.
Michael Van said he felt very honored to take part in the parade and added the pride of a true hero with the support that you give to many people.
The combined combat arts fans stayed awake all night to watch the 206, instead of receiving Pepa Paige.
Imagine that you've been awake all night to observe the stubbornness of Altor 206, and eventually watching the major event is out of you.
The plan includes a contract containing 13 fights, including six on the main card, and a live live live live on channel 5 tonight.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Jagard Musasey and Rory McDonald were preparing for battle, the viewers in Britain remained shocked as the poll changed to Pepe Paige.
Some of them were not impressed by the change after they remained awake until the very early hours of the morning to watch the battle.
One fan described on Twitter the move to a movie depicting children as a kind of sick joke.
It is a government institution that states that at 6:00 a.m., the original content was inappropriate and therefore they had to move to the children's plans. Dave Schwartz, a senior vice president for marketing and communication with the editor, asked about the transmission.
Pump page, yeah.
President Balator, Scott Coker, said they were going to work on their schedules to include the future British viewers.
I think when I think about the return transmission, I think we can probably solve this.
But the hour is 6:00 a.m. a.m. there, and we can't solve the problem until day one in our time zone, that is, day in their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Trust me that in time the transition changed a lot of text messages between the parties, not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it. We thought it was a technical breakthrough.
But no, it was a government problem.
I can assure you that next time it's not gonna happen.
We only clean up five battles in six-- as we usually do-- we tried to give the fans more and we just overstepped.
It's a matter of inconsistency.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt that it was his sexual tendency.
Tom Daily, the Olympic jump in the water, said that when he was growing up he felt inferior from all others because of his sexual tendency -- but that feeling gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old jump said he didn't know until he got to the middle school that wasn't all like me.
In an interview given on the Desert Island Discs programme of Radio 4, under Lauren Lauren Laurene's direction, he said that the expression of gay rights to give others hope was expressed.
He also said that he became a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympic Games.
The usual guide of the old plan, Kristy Young, has been on leave for a few months.
In his appearance as the star of the first show by Lauren, Daley said that he felt that it felt \"so far as the others grew up that it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls\"
He said: \"To this day, you felt the landing, and the different feeling, there were real things that gave me the power and power and allowed me to succeed.
He wanted to prove that he was something he said, so he didn't let everyone know when he eventually found out what his sexual tendency was.
The man who won twice in the Olympic Medal became a co-director of a campaign by the IT community and used his participation in the games of British Nations in Australia this year to call on other countries to give legal status to homosexuals.
He made a clear impression on the subject because he felt fortunately given him the possibility to live openly and without consequences and wanted to give others a ‘ hope ’
The triple winner of the World championship said that falling in love with a man, creating American movies, Justin Lance Black, whom you met in 2013, caught me by surprise.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older last year, but he said that the majority of the ages had never been a problem.
He first played Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone his age who experienced similar elevateds and downs.
The couple became parents in June, a white boy named Robert Ray Black Daily, and Daily said that his whole point of view was changed.
If you'd asked me last year, it's all around that I have to win a gold medal.
You know what, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Golden Medal is Robbie
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after being diagnosed as a canceral tumor in the brain.
Daily said that his father didn't get the fact that he was going to die and that one of the last things asked was whether they had tickets for the Olympic games in London 2012 -- because he wanted to be in the first row.
I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be here to be in the first line Dad said.
I held his hand while his breath was stopped and only when he stopped breathing really and died. I finally knew he wasn't a murderer.
A year later, Daily competed with the 2012 Olympic Games and won the Red Medal.
I just knew that I've been dreaming for my whole life -- scrambling in front of a home audience in Olympic Games, it wasn't a good feeling.
That's also what inspired him to choose his first song - Proud's \"Same\" - who was identified during the preparation of the Olympic games and still makes him skin a duck.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 a.m., according to British summer clock.
Michaelson failed the performance and went down to the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
The American golfer Phil Michaelson will set a record on day one when he plays the 47th time on the Ryder Cup, but he will have to upgrade the performance so that the event will not become a sign of misery.
Michaelson, who participated in the 12th time and said that it was a record, went down to the bench by the decision of the Pyric Sea during the football games and the two footballes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as in the games with the United States team, Michaelson, who won five times at the Major Tourist, passed the half of the day as a cheerer and the second half working on his game in the south, hoping to repair the patient's suffering evil.
So, Michaelson, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the \"Le golf\" where the long grass tracks are not usually tolerated by bad beatings.
And if the competition itself is not terrible enough, Michaelson, in the game of the ninth day, competes against the exact British champion, Francesco Molinari, who cooperates with the initial player Tommy Peltowood and wins all four of their games this week.
If Americans, who lost four points at the beginning of the single 12 games, were successful in the first stages, Michaelson's game could have been decisive.
Fierrick expressed confidence in his player, though we didn't expect him to say anything else.
He fully understood his role today, huddled on my back, dragged his arm around me and said he'd be ready tomorrow.
He has a lot of confidence.
He's a member of the Hall of Fame and has added a lot to these teams before, and the week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's how it evolved, and that's how we thought we should go on.
He wanted to be on the track, just like all the other players.
Michaelson will break Nick Palado's record with the highest number of games in the Ryder Cup on day 1.
This may end his career on the Ryder Cup, which has never really matched his personal record peaks.
Michaelson's win stands at 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven arrows, although Fyric said that his presence added certain intangible advantages to the team.
He's amusing, sarcostic, mean, he likes making fun of people, and he better be with him in the dressing room.
I think the younger players also enjoyed having fun with him this week, and it was nice to see it.
It has a lot beyond the game itself
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big advantage may be gone soon.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows that a significant advantage before the last day in the single game of the Ryder Cup could change.
The Danish player started his way in the game in Waldrama in 1997, when the son of a Zongga for the game, Sab Belstros, had a 5-point advantage over the Americans, which he almost lost when he crossed the finish line with a small advantage and won 141 -2-13192.
I keep reminding myself that we had a great advantage in Waldarrama; that we had a great advantage in a game in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderama where we won, but with a modest advantage, Bjorn said, in the picture, after he watched victory 5-3, in Turner 2018, they were on the day of the day, and they were yesterday, leading to the 10-6 bla Gulf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
We have to give it all tomorrow.
We have to go on track and do all the right things.
It's not over until the pranks don't appear on the board.
We have a purpose, try to win the cup, and we need to focus on it.
I said all along, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of those who stand in front of us on the other side -- the best players in the world.
Bjorn was happy about his performance on the hard golf course and added, \"I think you never get ahead of golf anymore.
Tomorrow can be completely different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on personal performance, and it's completely different.
It's a pleasure to be on the track when everything goes well, but when you're there alone, then your full ability as a golf player is on the test.
And that's the message to be delivered to the players: you need to make the best of yourselves tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving your partner behind, and he has to make the best of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, the rival captain of the G'Im Fjorrick will expect better personal performance than his players, compared to the performance of the couple games, except for Jordan Speth and Steven Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Fyorrick himself knows the winning side and they're the lost side, during the important graduation days of this kind, after participating in the winning team in Brooklyn before it was lost, when you chose Europe as a miracle-winning victory in the final game, as recorded in the film \"Miracle at Medinah\"
I remember every word and word he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenseau, Captain in 1999, encouraged his players towards the last day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but I want to make the first steps, like you've seen in Brooklyn, and as you've seen in Medinah.
When this muminom goes to one side, he's putting a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We're preparing our vehicle according to and uploading the guys on track. According to the feeling we have, you know, we're trying to do magic tomorrow.
Thomas was charged with trying to lead the fight, and he'll face Rory McAlroy at the summit, with Paul Cassie, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flettowood and Ian Fullter, who are the rest of the Europeans in the upper half of the class.
I chose this team of players because I think he'd be able to bring us to the end.
Germany's new warship acceptance was denied again.
Germany's new fleet frigate was due to be received in 2014 to replace the modified warships from the cold war period, but it was rejected at least a year, due to damaged systems and increased costs, the local media were reported.
Rheinland-Pfalz's receipt, led by the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-Class Parliaments, has now been denied up to the first half of 2019, according to the report of the newspaper quite a quote quoted by a military speaker.
The cruise vessel was supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but issues of concern after supply sealed off the wave on the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the Bremen-class-type old frigates.
It's expected that they could have a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft missile batteries and anti-ship, as well as alien technologies, such as aquastic signatures, demistry infra-red radar.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, which can be spread over the last two years.
However, repeated delays mean that the new ships, which are meant to allow Germany to send overseas forces, will be becoming obsolete until the moment they enter the service, indicate quite a quote.
The F125 lucky frigate reached the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss terminal in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to build ships after its escape.
Not much is known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media quoted a number of software and hardware, critical that made the warship useless for use in a combat mission.
The software links were particularly important because the fleets of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-Class type will be activated by about 120 sailors - half of the crew that was used in the older, more-bremen class.
In addition, it has been discovered that the ship has an additional dramatic weight that reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add further improvements in the future.
The weight of the Rheinland-Pfalz ship is 7,000 tons, and it's two times as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Except for the project software, the cost label of the project, which also includes the training of the team, also becomes a problem.
It has come from rumors of a dramatic rise of 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) over the original 2.2 billion.
The problems that keep the newest races are especially thought of in light of recent warnings that Germany’s marine power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartles, Chairman of the German Parliament's Security Committee, has confirmed that today, the Navy has failed ships capable of carrying out a tax.
The official source said that the problem had grown exponentially and increased over time, because old ships had been out of service but had not been replaced by other vessels.
He expressed regret that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate was allowed to enter the Navy.
Scotland National Fund listening to the secret life of bats
A new study conducted at the mansion in the Scotland Harriet has to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for their food.
The hope is that founders will newly shoot the behavior of the flying mammals and assist with the direction of future preservation activities.
The study of scientists at the Scotland National Foundation will follow up on existing bats and European bats, as well as on the brown dovanton bats and long ears at the Inbrio garden in West Ross.
Special tapes are located at key sites around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handicrafts.
An specialized voice analysis of all recordings will determine the frequencies of the bat readings and who understands the species responsible for them.
At the next point, the map of the living areas will be relegated to create a detailed picture of the size of the landscape’s patterns of behavior.
Most Mailver, a natural preservation consultant for the National Foundation of Scotland, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of life are the most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of the management work of the living areas, such as the creation of brothers and sisters and the best protection of forest areas for bats and other related species.
The population of the bats in Scotland and across Britain has been considerably reduced during the last century.
They're subject to a threat from development and construction work that affects the Kenyan and the loss of living areas.
Wind and lighting turbines may also be at risk, and the same is true of fly traps and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as domestic attacks.
In fact, the bats are not blind.
However, because of their nighttime hunting habits, bat ears are more useful than any contact with the capture of prey.
They use sophisticated tracking techniques using DNA to track insects and identify obstacles to their flight path.
The NTS fund, which is responsible for treating over 270 historical buildings, 38 major genes and 760,000 acres of land across the country, is very seriously treating bats.
She's got 10 trained experts, who perform screen-breeding, Kenyan tests and sometimes also rescue.
The organization also set up the first reserve and the unit dedicated to bats in the T'Rev district in Damascus and Galawi, which serves as a home for eight out of ten of Scotland's many bats.
Warden David Thompson said the mansion is the ideal territory for them.
We have a great area for the bats here.
We have old buildings, a lot of ancient trees and all the appropriate living areas.
But many things are not yet known about the bats, so the work we do here and other assets will help us understand more what they need to prosper.
He emphasized the importance of testing to find the bats before performing maintenance work in the assets, since the unintended destruction of a single-dwelled nest could destroy up to 400 females and babies, and it might also destroy an entire local population.
The bats are safe and killing, harassment and interference with the bats or destruction of their nest areas, legally prohibited.
Elizabeth' Pearl, a Scotch Officer at the Bat Guard Foundation, encouraged the public to give a shoulder and help.
She said, \"We have a lot more to learn about our bats and many of our species. We just don't know what their population situation is.\"
Ronaldo cancels the rape charges while the lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo called his rape charges \"Pike News\" and said that people wanted to promote themselves by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Dr. Schigel, who made the charges.
The turnout of the Portuguese and Viventos teams was charged with the rape of an American woman named Kat'Ryn Mugra, in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
According to the suspicion, he subsequently paid her $375,000 to keep you silent about the incident, reported Dr. Sheppel on day 6.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo turned to the 142 million his editors in Instagram Video lived a few hours after the charges were posted and called for the reports.
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said yesterday, Pike News, told the player's camera that won the light balloon five times.
They want to advance themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all good - add the player in a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Dr. Pigel for the charges, which they have referred to as an unacceptable report of privacy suspicions, according to the Roiters report.
Lawyer Christian Schretz said that the player would seek compensation for moral damages in the amount that corresponds to the violation, and it is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the last few years.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the suite of the casino hotel Palms in Vegas.
After meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and George returned, according to the report, to the player's room and the actor allegedly raped her, according to documents filed in the District Court of Clark Nevada.
Morgana claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told her that he was a good guy - in -99 percent - who let down a \"one percentage\" -
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that they were in agreement.
George also claims that she had turned to the police and that the photos of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but then she agreed to arrange outside the court lines because she felt terrified of revenge and fear to be publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old says she's now interested in canceling the arrangement because she's still suffering from trauma due to an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the Real Madrid from Master United during the alleged attack, and he went to the Italian Yoventos Club in a 100 million euros worth of deal.
Bracsite: Britain regrets forever the loss of car manufacturers
Britain will regret it forever if you lose its status as world leader after the Barkzit, British Minister of Business, Greg Clarke.
He added that the British Toyota's interview to BBC, in which he said that if Britain left the European Union without an agreement, she temporarily stopped the production at the Brinston plant, near Derby, was Mdig.
We need an agreement. Said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of delays on the borders of the Barczit case without an agreement could go up to positions.
The Bronston plant, producing the models orris and Avantis of Toyota, produced close to 150,000 vehicles last year, with 90% dating to the rest of the European Union.
From my point of view, if Britain comes out without an agreement from the European Union at the end of March, we'll see the cut-off in our factory.
Other British car manufacturers raised concerns about leaving the European Union without an agreement and how it would affect cross-border trade, including Honduras, BMW, and Viguarland Robber.
BMW, for example, says she'll close her \"mini\" factory in Oxford, for a month after the Barczit.
The main concerns relate to what vehicle manufacturers call the risks of the supply chain in the Barczit case without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is managed on a exact time basis with parts that come every 37 minutes, provide British and the rest of the European Union, create cars on an order basis.
If Britain abandons the European Union without an agreement on March 29, it may result in a border-distorting, and the causes of the sector say they may lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
Toyota can't hold a stock worth more than one day at the Drebshire plant, says the company, and that's why the production will be stopped.
Clark said that Teresa May's \"Crash\" plan, detailing the future relationship of Britain with the European Union, is a precise one to prevent these tests at the border.\"
We want to get to the best agreement we can, as I said, not only to enjoy success in the present, but also to take advantage of the opportunity.
The testimony from the draft and other vehicle manufacturers is that the possibility of continuing the use of the successful supply chains, which we have up to today, is absolutely vital.
Toyota didn't say how long it would last, but for the longer term, she warned that additional costs would harm the factory's competitions and eventually cause death.
Peter Chuvalaris, who has worked at Branston for 24 years, and used as the president of the U.N.A. at the factory, said that the association's members are more and more concerned: \"In my experience, if the jobs are reduced, they will never be returned.
A government speaker said: “We have proposed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union ”
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's meeting with the Deputy General Attorney Rod Rosenstein, who is dependent on her, could be “convulsed in another week ” while the battle against the candidate for the Supreme Court, Burt Kwano, continues, saying the White House on the day of 1”.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller, who investigates Russian intervention in the election, contacts between the assistants of Trump and Russia and possible manipulation of investigation procedures by the President.
The gossip in Washington was a deal for months on the question whether Trump would fire the Deputy Attorney General and thus risk Muller's independence.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein Dan could carry a wire to record calls with Trump and cause the President's rejection by means of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But the last day he came to the White House, and according to the reports he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for the 'Tramp' day, which was when Rosenstein arrived at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that it would be best not to fire Rosenstein, but at this point the meeting was denied to prevent a conflict with the hearing at the Senate Legal Committee, where he testified that he and one of the women accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior, Dr. Christine Blysey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week's investigation into the claims against Quano, and rejected the vote in the Senate again.
The speaker of Trump, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News on Sunday.
In the answer to the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: \"We haven't set a date yet for the meeting, it may exist this week, I can see a suspension another week considering the Supreme Court.
But we look and I'm always happy to update the press
Some reporters have questioned this fact: Sanders has not provided a press release for the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace offered to ask why.
Sanders said that the directories didn't come from a parking lot on TV, even though she said: \"I won't deny the fact that they're taking a position.\"
She then offered to increase the direct connection between Trump and the press.
The President has more questions and answers than any president before him.
The press guides will still be in place, said Sanders, but if the press has a chance to present questions directly to the president of U.S., it's much better than talking to me.
We have often tried to do this, and you have seen that we have done so many times in the past few weeks, and meetings that allow us to speak to the President of the United States, will change press directions.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open meetings or journalism during important visits.
His press parties alone are rare.
The week in New York, the President may have demonstrated the reason for this, with an open appearance and at times strange to books gathered in place.
The Health Service writes to the employees of the European Union in NHS Scotland and refers to concerns about Barczit.
The Health Service wrote to the staff of the European Union, engaged in the National Health Service of Scotland, to express the gratitude of the country and to request that it remain after the Barquesite.
Scotty Parliamentman Jean Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the release of Britain from the European Union.
The Soviet government has already committed itself to pursuing applications for a permanent candidate for European Union citizens working in its foreign public services.
Ms. Freeman wrote in the letter: over the summer, the negotiations between Britain and the European Union on the continued exit, and it is progressing towards the decisions that are expected in the fall.
But the British government has also increased its readiness for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this time might be very worrying for all of you.
That's why I wanted to come back and say how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the team, regardless of his nationality.

Christyon Abrami is undergoing an emergency surgery after having had head injuries.
The back guard from the University of Tansey, Christyon Abrakumby, had an emergency operation after he had been hit in the head from losing 31-27 on the Saturday of the Commodores group of Wenderbright University, the Mike Organ report from the Tunisians.
Rod Reid, the main coach of the University team of Tancy, told the reporters that the incident occurred shortly before the middle.
He went to the front lines and just collapsed there, saying Reid.
The coaches and the medical team gave the oxygen particles in the field, and then they put it up on alonka and took it for another inspection.
A U.S.A. said Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, in Texas, that Barcomby was transferred to surgery at the Wenderbright Medical Center.
Harris added that there are still no details of the type/detection of surgery - and the University of Tanci is still trying to figure out when the impact occurred.
Abrakumby is an athletic student and this is his first season with the University of Tansey after the transfer from Illinois.
He participated in five files just before he got out of the game, and raised his file for the 18th season.
Buying strangers would require higher stamps when buying assets in Britain.
Foreign buyers would commit a higher tax of stamps when buying assets in the UK and plus income would be used to help homeless people, according to the new conservative scheme.
The step will undo Corbin's move success. Pull new voters.
The tax answer is for those who are not paying tax in Britain.
The treasure expects the tax to recruit up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will commit a higher tax rate when they buy an asset in the UK -- plus income will be used to help the homeless, announce Teresa May today.
The move is seen as an attempt to counteract the success of Jeremy Corbin's move to attract young voters, with promises to provide cheaper housing and focus on high-income owners.
No. Bullets will take on non-taxable people and companies in Britain, and the additional revenue will strengthen the government's move to help the old people under difficult conditions.
The payment, which is added to the current stamp, including higher tax levels on secondary residences and real estate investments for rental, may reach a height of three percent.
The treasure expects the move to recruit up to 120 million pounds a year.
According to the estimate, 13 percent of the new assets built in London are purchased by foreign residents, the price increases are difficult and expensive for the people who first earn an asset to put a foot on the housing ladder.
Many rich areas in the country -- and especially in the capital -- have become ghost cities -- because of the high number of foreign buyers that spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the stamp to help young people acquire a home.
He accuses large-scale construction companies in the price of precious assets, as they are taking over land but not using them, and he is eager to abandon the cover of affordable houses and repair the desert of Britain.
Corbin has announced a series of targeted interactive improvements in housing, including rent control and undetected evacuation.
He also wants to give more power to the council to build new homes.
May said, last year, I said I'd devote my term to the restoration of the British dream -- which is the life should be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live in Britain, as well as companies in foreign countries, can purchase homes that are as easy as working Britishs.
The dream of becoming homeowners has become too far away for too many people, and the humiliation of sleep under difficult conditions is too real to see.
J'K Ross: \"My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland\"
Director Sanderland J'K Ross said that his ultimate meaning is to become the Director of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotty's fantasizes about the North East Club's conversion challenge, which is currently in the third place in the first league, three points away from the pre-degradation.
He moved to the summer light stadium after leading St. Miren back to the first place in Scotland in the last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I once participated in an international game, and this is where Ross said to the Scotch BBC Sportsound show.
But when I was growing up, I watched the Scotland team playing a lot with my dad as a boy, and it was always something that pulled me back.
Anyway, this opportunity will only come if I manage the team.
The former Directors of Sanderland include Dick Adobakt, David Mozz, Sam Alrades, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keen, Gus Foyeh, and Paulo di Canio.
The former director of Aloha Elettik says that he was not afraid to come after such well-founded names at such a large club, after he had previously rejected offers from Bernsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, a success right now, you'll learn by 'can I return the club to Framier League'?
Because of the structure and the facilities at this club, he undoubtedly belonged to the Primier League, he said.
It's not an easy task to bring him there, but I can see myself as a success story here only if I can get the club back there.
Ross started his management career only three years ago, after a period of Assistant Director in Dublin and 15 months as the Herts team coach.
At the next stage, he helped the audience get out of League C and raised St. Miren from the stage to its status as a championship winner in the following season.
And Ross says he's more comfortable than ever during his game career at Calleed, Hartolpol, Fulkkirk, St. Meren and Milton's academic.
It was probably a true point, he remembered, about taking control of Aloha.
I really believed the management position was my match, more than the game.
That sounds weird because I played okay, I've probably earned, and I've been enjoying some of the likely features.
But an actor's career can be difficult.
There's a lot of things you need to deal with every week.
I'm still dealing with everything that concerns stress and pressure at work, but management just feels right.
I always wanted to run, and now I'm doing it, and I never felt more comfortable with myself as an adult.
You can listen to the full interview at Sportmond, Sunday, September 30, on Scotland Radio between 12:00 and 13:00, according to the British summer clock.
The perfect hour for Pint beer is at 17:30 a.m. Saturday, he's in a poll.
The heat wave has increased the profits of the British pubs struggling to exist, but has made the restaurant networks nervous.
Groups of pubs and barbers had a 2-7% increase in sales in July -- but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent, revealed the data.
Peter Martin, the CGA Business Counsel, who collected the data, said: “The significance of the bright weather and the long-term participation of England in the World's championship is that July had a similar pattern of June, with the pubic income rising by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants suffered a even harder blow.
The 1.8% decline in the trade in restaurants seen in June is only the fall in July.
Pubs and bars focused on drinks registered the most powerful performance, with a higher growth than in the restaurant business, compared to the previous period.
Pubs who are focused on food also suffered from the sun, although they were less dramatic than restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among the bar and bar networks, the percentage of the liquor sales rose by 6.6% over the month, and the food sales store fell by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RSM's network of data analysis from the puny field, said: ‘ These results continue the range we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of sports or important social events are the most important factors in the out-of-home market.
It's not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a decrease of 4.8 percent in sales compared to last year would be particularly painful in addition to all half of the fixed costs.
The long summer and the heat couldn't have come at a worse moment for business focused on food, and time would say if the longer temperatures that we experienced in August would bring to the fore what they needed so much.
The growth rate in the sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, stood at 2.7 percent in July, and the slow pace of brand launch.
The sales control factor for the United Kingdom's pubs, barbers and restaurants, Coffer Peach Tracter, collection and analysis of performance data from 47 teams, with a combined business cycle of up to 9 billion pounds, is the rate of performances set in the sector.
One out of five children has social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
A survey of one out of five children -- some of them only 11 -- has secret accounts in the social media that they hide from parents and teachers.

One out of five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, creates social media accounts that he keeps secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts, as a reminder of the sharing of photos, instegram.
The news has raised concerns about the publicity of sexual content.
20 percent of the students said that they run a clean “head account ” to show their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother who ran into the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found that she was asking for others to rape me.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the British School of Independent School Directors (HMC), found 40% of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles and half of them admit they have private accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Bobnan, said: \"It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them.\"
Illid Doyle will be used as a “cool for the athletics, ” in the Scotian athletic board.
Ilida Doyle was elected to the Scotian Arts Department as an external architect at the annual board meeting.
Duyle is the most humble athlete and President Ian Bitty has described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who are guiding sports branches to benefit from the rich experience at the international level during the last decade.
Ileed has been very honored by the Soviet, British and world athletic community, and we are sure that the Scots will benefit greatly from the fact that you have brought to the board a good deal.
Doyle said, \"I am eager to be used as a voice for athletes and hope that I can really contribute and help with the sport direction in Scotland\"

Publicized awareness of milk pumps comparing mothers to cows with online opinion parties
A milk pump company has a web-based opinion with an awareness that compares mothers with females to cows' milk.
To mention the pool of pump intended to be the world's first silent milk pump, Elvie private user technology company, a humorous video advert to demonstrate the working freedom that the new pump provides mothers.
Four real moms dance in a cow's barn full of sounds that include words like: \"Yes, I'm thinking myself, but you can't see tail and in case you don't notice it's not bad, but my breasts.\"
The song dress goes on and says, \"Shot, pump, I feed the babies, the pump, the pump, I mix my girls.\"
But the ad, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused network controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of responses, the video received feedback from the viewers, and many said that it sheds light on the horrors of the milk industry.
The decision is very bad to use flowers to publish the product.
Like us, they also need to get pregnant and have a baby to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them in a few days after the birth.
Elvie's milk pump combines discreetly within the waterfront (Elvie/Mother)
Another reaction said, \"Tracticately trauma to the cow and circle as one.\"
But, hey, why not use them to publish a milk pump for the mothers who have the right to keep their babies
Another response said, \"A completely shut-off commercial\"
Others protected the commercial, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was a laugh
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I'd still clean up.
The exchange made me feel just like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I was referring to her contents.
It's a genius product.
Another reaction said: this is a funny ad for mothers who are angry (often in their places of work or in the bathroom) and feels like cows.
It's not a conscious that you're snooping or judging the milk industry.
At the end of the video, the women's group found out they were all dancing with the discreet pumps inside their bras.
The idea behind the campaign is that many women who use the milk pump feel like cows.
But Elvie's pump is completely quiet, without pipes and wires, it's discreetly integrated into the clean-up bra and thus giving women freedom to move, hold their babies, and even come out during the exchange.
Anna Blarin, a partner and responsible for the early development department at Mother, mentioned: \"The Elvie pump is such an alternative product that she received a bold and pubic drink.
The creation of a comparison between women who express themselves and those who are sick, wanted to put the milk powder and all the challenges in it in the light of the discharges, and to demonstrate in a spectacular way that they were unique, the amazing sense of freedom that the new pump would provide.
It's not the first time Elvie's pump makes headlines.
During London's fashion week, a mother took two kids on the track for the designer Martha Jacobowski using a product.
Hundreds of migrant children were safely transferred to camp in Texas border.
The number of migrant children in custody has been drained even though several half of the monthly border remains relatively unchanged, and one reason is that Director Trump's leadership and policy have challenged the transfer of children to sponsors.
Most sponsors were immigrants without documents themselves, and they were afraid to risk their ability to stay in the country by submitting applications for a child's responsibility.
The risk is a man in June, when the federal authorities declared that potential sponsors and other adult household workers would have to deliver fingerprints, and those data would share with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to the Congress that the association had arrested dozens of people who had applied for bail.
The authority subsequently confirmed 70 percent of the arrests had not been criminal before.
Nearly 80 percent of the hostages or their domestics are illegally found in the country, and a large part of them are criminals from foreign countries.
That is why we continue to go after these people, Mr. Albens.
In order to deal with solutions for children more quickly, the officials introduced new laws that required some of them to appear before a court within a month of their arrest, instead of 60 days as standard according to previous regulations, the refuge workers were reported.
Many show up through a video conference, instead of face-to-face, to present their arguments for legal status before a judge for immigration matters.
Those who do not find the right to be released will be expelled quickly.
All these children will be covered longer, so they are more likely to develop anxiety and depression, and this may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, reports of shelter workers and reports published by the system in recent months.
Consultants say these concerns are overcome by larger facilities like Tornalo, which are likely to be signs of the children's elderly being abandoned because of the size of the facility.
They concluded that the transfer of children to a city without a period of time would make them emotionally and emotionally separate from friends could make the trauma that many are already coping with.
Syria says \"The forces of occupation\" of the American, French and Turkishs to withdraw immediately.
The Secretary of State, Walid Al-Mobbes, also called on the Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country was now in the eighth year.
Disappeared, as well as Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces are on Syrialand illegally, under the excuse they fight terrorism, and the U.S.
They should withdraw immediately and without conditions.
In Syria, more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been visited.
He said that Damascus would continue to fight this holy battle until we clear the Syrian territory of terrorist organizations and any illegal stranger present - as one.
The United States has 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly for training and consulting of the rebel and Syrian forces against the President of Al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 warriors on the country's soil from the wars.
With regard to the issue of refugees, he said that the conditions for their return were good and accused of “certain Western countries ” in the case of a lack of reasonable fear of being driven by refugees to stay away.
We called on the international community and the humanitarian organizations to assist in their return.
They're making politics for a matter that is intended to be humanitarian only
The United States and the European Union have warned that assistance will not be sent to the construction of Syria until there is no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up an arrow zone in Idelib, from the recent great rebels, has created an opportunity to advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turk agreement prevented a large-scale attack of Syrian forces in support of the Russians on the county, where three million people lived.
However, the focus of the agreement was clear deadlines and expressed the hope that military action would focus on the Jad fighters, including the fighters from the winning-in front of Al-Qaida organization, which would be destroyed.
The UN dispatcher Stefan de Messytora hopes to attend first meetings of a new committee, which will be accompanied by government and opposition members, in order to lay down a solid draft of the post-war system and complete the way for the elections.
Moffat established conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Commission and said that the panel work should be limited to examining the consequences of the current Constitution, and warned of interference.
Why would Trump win a second dance?
According to this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers are apparently hoping, the rejection and scandal will end his president before her appointment.
While there is no doubt about it, the most dramatic chapter in the history of the presidents of all time is about to come.
Right now, there's no sign of a fight with the viewers.
Since 2014, the share of watching at the peak has risen to double and reached 1.05 million in CNN and almost spent themselves up to 1.6 million watchers at MSNBC.
The average number of Fox News stands at 2.4 million watching record hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nelson, and the Rich's show at MSNBC, came to the head of the cable's ratings with up to 3.5 million watching important news nights.
It's the fire to which people are drawn because it's not something we understand.

Of course, unlike all the other television programs, the line of descent in Washington can determine the future of the Reu ruling against Wade, whether families of immigrants can reunite and the world economic health.
The replacement of a channel or absconding is a gift that only the most qualified viewers can afford.
And yet, you've been crossing the limits when you've found out that you've been watching yourself for six hours at the panel of experts used by Bob Woodward in a confidential intelligence, as a source to tell that \"Bobbers's skin jacket is worth $15,000 of Paul Manaport (\"a very arrogant suit - Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' secret profiles for, and regret for, the expression, the Athonymia of Trump.
I, for example, would never look at Super Mario the same way again.
Some of what he does, which feels similar to a reality show, is that he's feeding you in something every night, said Bert Montegumery, the CEO of the Weelhouse Enterprise and the production of the \"historic history\" program about the team that replaces the Trump show and the annual coups (the war with the NFL League, the praise of Kim Jong-un).

When I got to Mr. Flyce this week, it was bright outside with a temperature of about 26 degrees north coast of Caway Island, but he closed to watch MSNBC, and recorded CNN in parallel.
He couldn't break up, not when Burt Kwano was prepared to stand before the Senate's Legal Committee and the Supreme Court's future is at stake.
I remember the times when we made all these crazy shows in the past and people said it was the beginning of Western civilization.
I thought it was a joke, but apparently they were right.

Financials from outside sources expect the race to be chosen for the most close middle of Congress.
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district is facing a cash-flow, thanks to the re-organization of Congress, which brought the two Congress members' race on the same seat.
The county, Frewer of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been re-entered, has placed the democratic representative Connor Lamb, who won his seat in another district, in a special election in the last spring.
Lamb ran against another congressman, the Republican Keith Roth, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which is largely flooded with the borders of the new 17th district.
The maps were retraced after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the previous district dispute had been wrongly replaced and, contrary to the Constitution, the consequences for the Republicans.
The race in the 17th district set a battle against the financial diamonds on the campaign between the financial weapons of the major parties, the DDCC and the NRCC.
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a sharp victory in the special election in March, which won a wide view, for the 18th Congressional district in Pennsylvania.
The seat belonged to the Republicans for over a decade, and President Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political scholars have seen a slight advantage for democracy.
Irrab was responsible for punishing Al Sylvedor because of support for China, and later the company
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already met in Big’ing, with easy resistance from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos and Arla, in June 2017, and held the hotel in Panama until his associates withdrew the management team of the Trump Company.
The Foreign Office officials decided to return the heads of the American diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in response to the recent decisions not to get to know the Union anymore, said Mr. Norret, speaking the office, in an earlier statement at the beginning of the month.
But the punishment was held only against Sylvedor, who was estimated to have received $140 million in assistance in 2017 that included drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed punishments, which included cuts in financial assistance and restrictions focused on entry visas, could have hurt the country from the Central American Center for Unemployment and High Murder.
In the advance of the internal meetings, officials from North and Central America rejected an urgent convention to focus on safety and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar convention last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from reaching the United States.
But in the middle of September, high-ranking government officials made clear their wish to promote the conference, thus ending all punishments against Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Fance is now supposed to go to the participants, who are currently set up in the middle of October, as a symbol of the importance of the government, said the diplomats.
And three American missionaries returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new words or punishments from Washington.
The White House Speaker of Bolton refused to respond to the details of the debate described by the three American officials, and even two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussions, on condition that they would remain anonymously there.
Their explanations were confirmed by an external analyst, close to the government, who also spoke anonymously there.
Learn History
The next obvious thing may come from the report of the Special Adviser, Robert Muller, on the occupation of the alleged investigation procedures of Trump, whose heights now exist significant evidence of public records.
Muller turns his investigation, according to the reports, to the question whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in its attacks on our election system.
If Congress control changes, Trump will find himself accountable to this body, just as he prepares to meet the voters again, and perhaps even to a jury.
There are a lot of questions here that start with M and I don't intend to argue that Trump's fall is inevitable -- not even of those who are comparable to him in Europe.
From both Atlantic sides, we all have to make choices that will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were willing to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West would have opposed him and supported his actions.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to prevent the resulting death.
History moves around such turning points, and democracy cannot be interrupted, accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What are we gonna do if Trump fire Lieutenant General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this paper reported that last year he secretly offered to record the President and to raise doubts about his disagreement with presidents.
Rosenstein said the Times report wasn't accurate.
How will we react if the F.B.I. investigation into the recently requested Burt Kwano issue is not complete or fair - or if he is willing to make his appointment to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual assault and false witnesses?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-Cathedral and Congress election to take over Trump's responsibility?
If we fail these tests, the democracy will go into a long winter nap.
But I believe we won't fail because of the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was expelled from Switzerland by the Nazi regime who had also taken up the magnificent house I had.
She survived, dragged to America and 60 years later, sent me to light Saturday candles on the same table carrying the hook cross.

The Ring'ers are hosting Ravid Vienna on the day of \"and they know that, after the impressive case against Viral in Spain earlier this month, they will place them in a strong position to misbehavior from Group G in the European League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorance from showing up for the first time in the season until the 2nd with Vireal, but he believed that the Ring'S could use this result as a springboard for better performance.
It was a good point for us because Variel is a good group.
We went out to play out of a belief that we could get something and we got a point.
We could possibly win at the end, but, in all things, his bag was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we got out of the stairwell in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's gonna be a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but with the audience behind us, I'm convinced we can push and get a positive result.
Last year was really hard, with everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but there's a good feeling about the place now.
The team's good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, put the last season back and succeed.

Earth ' s earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people found their deaths on the earthquake and heavy tsunamis that hit the Indonesian Palo city, saying official sources, and the death figures were expected to rise.
The disaster caused the separation of the communications networks and the official causes responsible for the assistance could not get information from Dongala County, a region in northern Palo, which was closer to the source of the noise itself of 7.5.
In Palo, over 16,000 people turned up after the disaster hit.
Before you have a few facts about Palo and Dungala, Bhai Solowasi:
Palo is the capital of the Republic of Slovenia, located at the end of a narrow Bay on the west coast of the Solowasi island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017, according to estimates.
The city mentioned its 40th anniversary when the tsunami and the earthquake hit it.
Dongala is the province of São Paulo, over 300 miles (180 miles) of a coast line in the north-west of the Solowasi island.
The population in the district, an administrative area within the United States, was estimated at 299,200 men in 2017.
The main sources of income in the economy of the United States are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Another important source of income is the mining of nickel, concentrated mainly in Marwal, on the coast opposite Solowasi's side.
Palo and Dungala have been hit several times by waves of tsunami in the last 100 years, according to the Indian Agency for Disaster Relief.
In 1938, a tsunami wave killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dungala.
A tsunami wave also hit Western Dungala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Ring area, known for its symmetry activity and has been permanently damaged by earthquakes.

Federal prosecutors seek the death penalty rarely to suspect a terrorist attack in New York City.
New York federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for Sipolo Sipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people - a rare sentence that has not been put into effect for a federal crime in the country since 1953.
The 30-year-old Cypov used the loaded truck of Dipou to carry out a bike-track attack on the side of the West Side highway in South Manhattan, and ran a motorcycle ride that ran into October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Silipov had deliberately killed the eight victims and caused “first time” serious injuries to the body, according to the statement of intent to seek death, which was presented in the southern quarter of New York.
According to the court's document, death can be required for these two charges.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury in Sipov with an indictment of 22 rapes, including eight murder charges of blackmail aid, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required a significant advance and deliberate planning. The prosecutor said, and described the way the attack was carried out as a humiliating, cruel, and sick act.
Sipulo Habibovich has caused harm, damage and loss to his families and friends of Diego Angni, Nicholas Calves, Anne-Lor D.C., Darn Drake, Ariel Illig, Hern Frocchi, Hern Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damin Pinuko, written in the statement of intents.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the south quarter of New York was punishing death in the case that happened a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was put into effect in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Atl Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were convicted of having been in contact for spying for the Soviet alliance during the two-year cold war.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court's documents, Sippov, the son of Osibakstan, did not express remorse over the days and months after the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about his actions, saying police.
Sippov told the authorities that he had inspired the attack after watching the videos of his cell phone, according to the indictment.
According to the police, he also asked for a flag of knowledge in the hospital room where he stayed.
He claimed to be innocent in response to the 22-year-old indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal defenders representing Sippov, said that they were, of course, disappointed by the prosecution's decision.
We think the decision to seek a death penalty instead of a confession of guilt that would lead to a life sentence without the possibility of release is merely a date for the duration of the trauma of these events on all those involved.
Sipov's secretarial team has previously asked the prosecutor not to punish the death penalty.
Parliamentman Merney says he's got to appoint Nigel Farage in charge of the Barczit negotiation.
Neig'l Farag's vow to recruit the people's army today during a protest at the conservatives' conference.
The former leader of the UKIP party said that politicians must feel pressure from the engagements -- when a member of the Parliament of the Teresa May Party claimed that he should be in charge of negotiating with the European Union.
Secretary of Parliament Peter Boone said in his defense in Bramingham that Britain was already outside at this point if Faraj was appointed Secretary of the Barkzit.
But the challenge in front of him stands, the very impressive lines of guards are highlighted by the joining of conservatives who support the stay of the European Union for a different demonstration against the Barquesite in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting for the rest of her resolution plan, the Cheers, on her way despite attacks by the Barquesite supporters, the remaining supporters and the European Union.
The Alliances were determined to continue to try and reach an agreement with Brussels despite the counter-actions - and to force the engagements and the libre party to choose between her agreement and Joshua.
Boone said at the meeting of the Leave Means Leave group in Seoul that he wanted to say good-bye to 'cars'.
He claimed that Prague had to be accepted as a friend and be in charge of the negotiations with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we would've been out at this point', he said.
Parliamentman Wallingboro added: “I will protect the Barksite, but we need to break up with the \"cars\".
He emphasized his opposition to the European Union and said: “We did not fight in two world wars to be slaves.
We want to set our own rules in our own country'.
Mr. Boone cancelled the claims that the public's opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: \"The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is totally false\".
The Conservative Parliament and the Barquesit Andre Ginkins also had a case and said to the reporters: \"I simply say: the Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Charter is not popular among the wider public, the opposition won't vote for it, it's not popular among our party and our active battles that go out on the streets and choose us in the first place.
Please leave the Crash and start listening'.
In a critical message to May, she added: “The heads of government keep their servants safe when they keep their promises. ”
Faraj said at the convention that it would make politicians feel the pressure if they were about to betray the decision made on the people's question in 2016.
It's now about the question of our trust, the people, and our political standing, he said.
They're trying to betray Barczit and we're here today to tell them that you won't be able to escape his execution.
He added, in a message to the enthusiastic audience, \"I want you to make our political status, which is about to betray in the British, feel pressure.
We call upon the people's army of this country, which has given us victory in theRESIT and will never rest until we become independent Britain, ruled by itself and proud.
At that moment, the remaining supporters took steps in Bramingham and then there was a two-hour assembly in the center of town.
An active group was waved in anti-Barczit sharps after the group was set up this weekend.
Lord Sires' member of the Lord's Legion for the opening of a conference for the guards on the security problems he suffered with the party's app.
It's about people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology that is possible to have an agreement like Canada plus plus, to cross a barrier without friction and free trade without borders in Ireland, which he added.
That's totally ridiculous.
There's no such thing as \"Barczit Good,\" he added.

Louis Milton finished with a world title after the teams gave him victory over Sebastian Votel.
It was clear, as of the moment that Walter Botas was ostracizing the next stage before Louis Hamilton on Saturday, that the Marcades team was going to play an important role in the race.
The first time he had a good start, he left Milton almost alone when he defended his place in the first two rounds and invited Votel to attack his teammate.
Votel went to the middle line first and let Milton fit in the tail of the competition, probably a big decision.
The Mercades team went to midway around later and returned to the race behind Wattl, but Milton moved forward after a tight wheel struggle which ended the Ferrari driver was forced to leave the internal track to stand without risk after a double move in the third corner.
Max Verstappan, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back of the rating and was in the seventh place at the end of the first round.

He ended up in the middle of the 44th round and was unable to increase the rate in the remaining eight rounds when Riconna took the fourth place.
It's a hard day because Walter's been doing a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he was let me get around him.
The team did an extraordinary job to get to the Dubble.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump is a champion of Senator Diane Pinstein at the convention on Saturday, in the context of her insistentness that he not leaked a letter from Christine Blaise Ford, who accuses Bert Kwano, who is nominated for the Supreme Court, in sexual assault.
At the time of the assembly in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Legal Committee, and instead said that the incident in the Senate shows that people are evil and disgusting and liars.
The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry, evil people and bullshit, and liars, he said.
When you look at commercials and leaks and then they say, \"Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Diane Pinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... Did you leak the document-- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
“ I Did Not Dread ”
So, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak, he added in the senate.
Pinstein received a letter detailing charges against Quano another month in July, and he was leaked earlier in September -- but Finnstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't leak her story.
She asked me to keep his secret and to keep the confidentiality of the letter as requested by me.
But it doesn't seem that the Senator's denial was accepted by the president, who responded during the conference on Saturday night: \"I tell you, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she's not [the leak], but it's the worst body language I've ever seen.
The President continued to protect the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, and claimed that the Democrats were using charges for their purposes.
They are determined to return to power at all costs.
You see the convictions, the disappointments, they don't care who they hurt, who they're on the way to power and power. The President said, according to Mediaite's report.

It's very amusing to know now what we know about the tremendous success of Pedington.
After saying that her father, who worked at BBC as a cameraman before he inspired the book of the kid from a small toy, would become a blood thirst about his job rejection, she added that the year 60th anniversary of the book was a bitter-sweet - after his death last year.
She added that her father was proud of his success, eventually of Pedington, which she described as a very important friend in our family.
He was a quiet man, not a arrogant man. She said.
But because Pedington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a kid who got something: you're proud of him even though it's not really because of you.
I think he saw Fedington's success kind of like that.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always said it was because of Pedington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was transferred to the hospital at Louie Pastester 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Ned called in a bath and said that it was a really bad situation, that she was not expected to hold.
And then I got a call from Mand where he said she was going to die for the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, Tashi, I love you so much, sweetie.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave her to keep her state going and disappear slowly and get out of her system.
She died sometime before, and it's over. It's all stopped.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing this was all happening.
I couldn't grow or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people right now.
I really had to hold on to it.
In the end, Ms. Adnan-Lapros, but now on a loss of her daughter, boarded a plane alongside other passengers, who were unaware of the last march.
No one knew - she said.
My head was a possession, and the tears of Zelego all the time.

That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women. Impressions on a bridge to prevent suicide.
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide, working to prevent them from taking their lives late.
Sharon Davis and Kelly the Parish had an discovery on a wall bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
The son of Mrs. Davis, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
I don't want any other parent to feel the way I feel every day.
Davis, 45-year-old, lived in Leidney, said her son was a promising chef with a glue smile.
Everyone recognized him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile lighted every room
But he stopped working before he died, because there was a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the same time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said:
Ms. Davis created the discovery so that people would know that there was someone who could be turned to and spoke, even if it was a friend.
- Don't sit in silence. - You need to talk.
Ms. Al-Mazziz, Mrs. Davis' girlfriend for years, has lost Mark, a partner for life for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed or something else she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at the stairwell on Christmas Day -- when the kids opened the presents -- he didn't make an eye contact or something.
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they've overcome it: it creates a hole in the family.
It rips us apart.
But all of us must continue and fight “the fine fight of the faith ”

The future of Burt Kwano is at stake when the FBI begins his investigation.
I thought, if we could really get what you asked for -- a limited time-limited investigation -- we might be able to bring aside from the union -- you said Flyke on Saturday and added that the committee was afraid that you were torn apart -- at the end of the suspended party's silence.
Why would the Republicans not be interested in the FBI investigation?
Their inspiration comes entirely from the timing.
The mid-Catholic election will last only five weeks, on November 6, and if, as an observer, the Republicans will not succeed in them, they will be very weak in their attempts to bring to the choice the man they want to the highest court in the country.
George 'W' Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to turn them around to support our Kosovo, who worked at the White House for Bush and met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.

It's still unclear whether Kovano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so as to allow Vice President Mike Fance to break the tie and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
Number of deserts in North Korea
The number of North Korean Americans in South Korea has fallen since Kang-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean lawman.
The Bong Sig Park quoted data from the South Korea Union Office and said that last year the number of publications stood at 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the main causes of this were the worsening border control between North Korea and China, which was based on the proceeds of the people.
Pyongang didn't make a public statement.
Most Americans from North Korea are eventually receiving South Korean citizenship.
According to Seville, over 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korea War in 1953.
Most of them run away from China, where North Korea has the longest border and the same is easier to cross than the DMZ, which has been well maintained between the two countries of Korea.
China treats aliens as illegal, non-failous, and often brings them back to life.
The relationship between the North and the South -- technically still in war -- has improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for the talks focused on the joint negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
The meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump and Kak Jong-un in Singapore, where the two were generally agreed to act towards an era when half of the Korean island would not hold nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young-ho, accused the sentences that the U.S.R. has been in progress since.
Without trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there will be no chance that our weapons will be unbundled once and for all in New York.
Nancy Flussey calls Bert Kovano Hasteri and says he doesn't fit for high court service.
The minority leader at the House of Representatives, Nancy Flossy, called the Supreme Court candidate, Hasteri, and said that his style did not allow him to serve in the Supreme Court.
Flussey responded to that in an interview on Saturday, at the Texas Tribune Festival in Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever appeared like this, they would say, \"The strategist's\" said Flussey about her response to Kwano's testimony to the Senate's Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kwano strongly rejected the allegations that Dr. Christine Blaise Ford had sexually attacked both of them when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Cavano was very emotional, and sometimes he screamed and suffocated when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He also defended democracy at the Committee and called for arguments against him - a well-known murder of Groatsky - organized because of the anger of the liberals that Hillary Clinton had lost in the presidential election in 2016.
Flussey said that Kwano's testimony showed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it had shown a prior opinion against the Democrats.
I think he broke himself up with these statements and the way he was chasing the clintons and Democrats.
Flussy hesitated to ask whether you would try to depose Koono if his appointment was made, and if the Democrats won most of the House of Representatives.
I'll say so -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI then he's not only fit, but also to the court where he's currently serving -- he said Flussy.
Kwano is currently serving as a judge in the Federal Court for the Warfare of Columbia County.
Flussey was added as a democracy, to her concerns about possible paragraphs of Cavanano against Obama's health or judgement against Wade, since he was considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kwano was avoiding questions about the possibility of canceling certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
There's no reason that a hysteric and co-disputed man would come to the court and expect that it was said that there is no great - Flussy said.
And women need to use it.
It's a severe review, months and years of anger is on his back, and she can't express them without crying.
We cry when we get mad. Mrs. Stynam 45 years later.
I don't think it's rare, right?
She went on, and I got a lot of help from a woman who was head of another place who said she also cried when she was upset, but she developed a technique and every time she got angry and started crying, she used to say to the person that you talked about, maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry
And then she just pulled.
And I thought it was brilliant.
The tears get as much as the rage, between the others because they're not built up by them.
One of my most significant memories of early hours in my life, in the office with Robby, is that I found myself crying once in an imperceptible rage, and an older woman caught my back, it was a cool manager from whom I was always afraid of a little-- and dragged me to the stairwell.
Don't let them see that you're ever crying. She told me.
They don't know you're a rage surgeon.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they've managed to suppress you.
Patricia Shepherd, who was at the same time a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Art was caught on an affair outside of marriage on a ship called Monkey Business and came out of the race, Sherder, who was deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason that she would not consider the idea of running the presidency itself.
It wasn't a decision I thought of well. She told me 30 years later and laughed.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they had to face was another.
Someone called it \"Slag and the Seven Goads\"
Since she joined the late-stage campaign, she'd be off to fund-raising, so I swear you won't join the race unless you recruit $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She found out that some of her supporters, who paid $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
They think I'm getting a discount she was wondering.
During the speech that announced that there would be no official election, the feelings had so much to say - gratitude to the people who supported it, frustration over the system that had so much to do with raising funds and focusing on the voters instead of the delegates, and anger over the sexual beauty - she was suffocated by tears.
You could think I had a nervous breakdown, remembering that weed in a way that the press responded to.
You could have thought I got a Sponsor from Clinks.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write about my situation?
She cried.
How the American - Chinese Trade War could be useful for Big’ing
The opening points of the U.S.-S. Trade War were earpieces, and although the battle was far from over, the countries could be useful to Big'ing in the long term, they said experts.
Donald Trump, president of U.S.A., shot the opening shot earlier this year when a tax missile on China's major export products, including solar, steel and aluminium.
The most significant trauma occurred this week with new assessments affecting US$ 200 billion worth of goods (150 million liters), with taxes actually levied on half of the goods coming to China.
Big’ing responded every time the same coin, and recently raised the shares by five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China is committed to bringing a blow to every strike in U.S., and the second big economy in the world is likely to be surrendered in the near future.
A request from D.C. means a surrender to her demands, but public Canada Larab will be too embarrassing for the president of China, Shi Ginfing.
However, experts say that if Big’ing is able to function properly, the pressure from the U.S. Trade War may be positively supported in China in the far term, reducing the severe links between the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Big'ing could create conditions for the beginning of a financial trade in each country is actually far more dangerous than the previous Indians have ever said, Abigail Grace, a research partner focused on Asia, in the New American Security thinking team.
Syria is ready to return the refugees, says the Foreign Minister.
Syria says she's willing to return voluntarily to refugees and aid to rebuild the country that was devastated by a long war that lasted for over seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations arrest, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mobbes said the conditions in the country were improving.
The situation on the ground is stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the war on terrorism, he said.
The government continues to re-establish the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore the situation.
All the conditions now exist for the free return of the refugees to the country they left because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that we have designed to harm their daily lives and their livelihood.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mobbes said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that the police wouldn't get any assistance or assistance from countries that put the rebels to death.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 and defeated the U.S. team as a final result of 16.5 - 10.5 on her golf course outside Paris, France.
IRAB has so far lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Raider Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again the crown when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team arrived at 14.5 the points it needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Michaelson, who fought for almost all of the tournament, sent his shot from T to the water at Far-3's 16th pillar, and lost the game against Francesco Molinari.
The brilliant Italian golf player in all of his rounds, and became one of the four players who have reached 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament in the current structure in 1979.
The American actor Jordan Speth was defeated 5 and 4 by the lowest-class player of the European team, Verbjørn Olsen of Denmark.
Dustin Joneson, the first-hand actor in the world, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Fullter from England, who could be the last time he played the Ryder Cup.
With a record of eight participations in the Ryder Cup, the Spanish Sergeia became an European player with the highest winning number of tournaments with 25.5 career points.
I'm usually not crying, but today I can't resist.
It's been a tough year.
So I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help.
He's passing the white torch, and John Ram, who defeated the American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 at the one game on Day 1.
The great pride I feel, defeat Tiger Woods, in which I watched when I grew up, said 23-year-old Ram.
Weds lost all four games in France and his record now stands at 13-21-3, as the Reyder Cup is in career.
This is strange statistical data from one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major events, before which he was only Jack Niclaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find her way through the lawn, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Pinano, who played a high-level golf all over the tournament.
Captain's U.R.J. team spoke after his team's disappointing performance, and I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Well done for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll re-organize, I'll work with the American Julf Professional Association and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
I like those 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
We need to take the hat off.

Update on the Red tide: The focus is in Florence, Manati, and Sorbonne.
The last report of Florida's wild life and fish committee represents a general decline in the red tide’s abundance in part from the Tampa Bay region.
According to the FWC Committee, more scattered rashes were reported in the Pillas, Manatty, Seruta, Charlotte and Claire districts, which points to reduced concentrations.
The emergence of the red tide is visible on the top of 130 miles from the coast, from the county of North Pilellas to the southern district of Lee.
The portion can be found at 10 miles across the coast of Helsboro County, but in a smaller number of locations compared to last week.
The Red tide was also seen in Pasco County.
Minimum concentrations of the coast line or against the coast of the Pelellas County were reported last week, low to medium concentrations in front of the coast of Helsboro County, background to high concentrations in Manati County, background concentrations up to the coast line or against the coast of Sersota County, background concentrations up to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background concentrations up to high concentrations on the coast line or across the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
We're going to pull the reports on the breathing system from the Penellas County, Manatti, Sersota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reports of respiratory thefts in Northwest Florida over the last week.
