AMs from Wales fear that they will be seen as a bolo-
There is a practice among some AMs after a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Wales Parliament).
This was raised by plans to change the name of the Wales Parliament assembly.
AMs around the political spectrum are concerned that this will make them look pretty .
AM Labour said that his group was concerned that it has the same sound as Twp and Pwp.
For outside readers Wales: In the language of Wales twp means ibleh and pwp means a lung.
AM of Plaid said that the whole group ‘was not happy and suggested alternatives.
Conservative by Wales said that his group had an open mind - about the change of name, but noted that there was a small verbal difference from MWP to Muppet -
In this concert the letter w in the language of Wales is published in a similar way to the publication of the letter and.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce changes to the name, said:
The act of the Government of Wales of 2017 empowered the Wales assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which had broad support for the assembly to be called a Wales Parliament.
On the issue of the title of AMs, the Commission favoured Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
It appears that AMs are suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching consensus may be a headache for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft legislation on the changes within a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes in the way the assembly works, including rules on the indeterminate of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on the question of how to be called when they have a debate on legislation.
In Macedonia leave the public opinion in a referendum on the country's name changes
Voting on Sunday on whether to change their country name for the Republic of Northern Macedonia
The popular vote was set with the aim of resolving a dispute that lasted decades with the neighbouring country Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for a long time that the name of its northern neighbourhood represents .
The President of Macedonia Gjerge Ivonov, opposition to the festival on the change of name, said that he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that change in name is simply the consequence of EU and NATO entry.
St.Martin's Cock Stops as the churches in Harlem are sending
The elders who spoke to them say that there was a bar and a church in every corner, said Mr Adams.
Today, there is no -
He said he could understand how the bars had disappeared.
He said, - People socialise differently - today.
-Brads are no longer the centre of people’s activity on a regular basis -
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders are thinking, - today or tomorrow they will come back where they were at first -
It added that churches can be replaced by apartment blocks with condoms filled with the kind of people who will not help the rest of the sanatoriums.
The vast majority of people who buy condoms in this building are white carnage, - he said, -and so they are not going to make it when it comes to the day they are browsing for these churches because most of these people who enter these condoms are likely not going to become members of these churches -
The two churches were built by white-carnage groups before Harlem became metropolitans of white-carnage people - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's ten years later.
The original Methodist Congregation of white-carnage people left in the 1930s.
A group of black-carnage people who had been practicing the nearby religion took the title to the building.
St. Martin's was taken by a group of black-carriage people under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a bottle of retailers on 125 Street, a main way to buy in Harlem, which maintained the rental or promotion of black-carnage people.
Fire left the buildings seriously damaged in 1939, but as Father Johnson’s peers made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carilone.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson's and the successor of St. Martin's, was proud when he called the carilon the people's bells -
The expert who brought up the carilone in July took another step: -Cultural treasure - and a unique historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world that had a black carnivoist, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to the largest carilon in the Church of Reverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not change with anyone else.
What happened at St. Martin's during the last few months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some introduced by the leaders of the laity church, others from the Episcopal Diocese.
The ‘vestry’ - the parliamentary body of the parish, composed of laity leaders - wrote the diocesia in July with concern that the diocesy will seek to pass the costs - to the vetry, although the vetry was not involved in starting the architects and contractors who took over from the diocese.
Some paranormals complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diosis.
Sea dog hurts a 13-year-old boy while still for a trap in California
A marine dog attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was coming to the lobster in California on the opening day of the trap season, officials were told.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. when Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was pitting with friends for about half an hour in the morning when he heard the child cry for help and then went out with a group to help pull out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the next excitement to catch a trap, but then he realized that he was shouting, ‘ Giddy!
Gidmani!'
She cut him off and opened the whole club, - Hammel said to realize the moment she arrived where the boy was.
‘It’s a dog in the water!’ - He added Hammel.
Take the child through a helicopter until Rady Child's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The species of the dog responsible for the attack was unknown.
Lary Giles said in a meeting with the media that the dog was fed in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a species of dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic wounds at the upper of the torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans enter the United Kingdom's beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing against Bots, Superdrug and Debenhams with sacraments similar to those of a ‘department chain’ of beauty products equipped with specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial income on the UK's beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while the sale of clothing and articles for domestic use decreases, the larger corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 shops across the country and the idea will be disseminated to more shops next year if successful.
The investment in beauty came after the supermarkets were looking for ways to use the space on the edges once used for TVs, microwaves and articles for domestic use.
Sainsbury's said that it will double the amount of the beauty goods that are offering up to 3000 items, including firms such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have more space with brand areas similar to those located in shops such as Bots.
The supermarket will also relaunch the range of its Butique makeout so that the majority of products are fit for vans - something that is increasingly requested by smaller buyers.
In addition, retailer Fragranance Shop will examine concessions at two Sainsbury's shops, the first one opened at Croydon, in lower London last week, while the second opening at Seley Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards small food shopping per day at local convenience shops means that supermarkets are having to do more to get people to buy from there.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that the shops will increasingly look like a ‘depart story’ as the supermarket chain tries to fight against shops that account for Aldi and Lidl's prices with more services and non-food products.
The Commission therefore concludes that the Commission considers that the State aid granted to Argosa does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to renew the departments of its beauty and restaurant has not been successful.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Bots in early 2000, but the link ended after a fight on how to split the revenues from pharmacists into its supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold the battery business with 281 shops to Celesio, owner of the Loyds Pharmaceutical chain, for £125 million, three years ago.
He said that Loyds would play a role in the plan, by adding an extended range of luxury skin care firms including La Roche-Posay and Vichy at four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business director of Sainsbury's, said: ‘We have transformed the appearance and sensation of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
The range of our firms has been designed to be appropriate for any need and the attractive environment for you and shops' convenient positions mean that we have become a destination of the beauty products of interest that challenge the old method of shopping.
Peter Jones's 'very hot' after Holly Willoughby cancels an agreement of £11 million
The personality of Dragons Den Peter Jones 'very angry' after the television presenter TV Holly Willoughby cancelled an agreement of £11 million with his lifestyle firm business to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for the home product firm and their accessories, Truly.
In addition, the Commission notes that the Commission did not take into account the arguments presented by the interested parties in the opening decision.
The presenter of This Morning, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce that he will leave.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' personality - Den Peter Jones very angry because it has been cancelled out of being part of their business of a lifestyle firm that makes a lot of money in the last minute - to focus on its major contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was very angry - when the very popular television personality admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his great business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, whose new agreements - with up to 1,5 million - meant that it was no longer sufficient time to devote them to their home products and accessories brand, Truly.
The business was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow Goop's firm and was intended to double the estimated wealth of Willoughby of £11 million.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, it appeared on Instagram to announce that it would leave with Truly, Jones left Great Britain and went to one of his private opponents.
According to the Court of Justice of the European Union, the Commission considers that there is no reason to doubt the existence of an anti-dumping duty on imports of certain steel products originating in the PRC.
It would have been its long-term future that would have filled it with the next few decades.
Its decision to leave left everyone completely shocked.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was almost here.
There is a full warehouse produced at Marlow's headquarters ready for sale -
The experts believe that the departure of the author of This Morning, who is among the profitable Great Britain's profitable personality, could mean a cost of millions for the company due to a large investment in products from wood and candles to clothing and household products, and the potential for further delays until its launch.
And it can mean an end to a long friendship.
Mother of three children, Willoughby and her village This Baldwin have been well friends with Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52, entered with them as Chairman Chairman Chairman in March.
In this respect, the Commission considers that the Commission considers that the measures in question constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) of the Treaty.
Willoughby shall become an ambitrative of the M&S firm and will replace Ant McPartlin as an I'm A Celebration of ITV.
Yesterday evening, a source close to Jones said -We don't comment on his economic affairs -
A difficult meeting 'but then we found love'
He pointed out about criticism that would be taken from the news media for making a comment that some people consider - non-presidial - and that it was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with a voice that imitates that of the news presenter.
I didn't give up anything.
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump celebrates that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearisation.
But denuclearisation negotiations have ceased.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Young Ho, told world leaders, on Saturday, at the General Assembly, that North Korea did not see - a corresponding response - from the United States to the early steps of North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, note that the US continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech.
He said, ‘We are walking well with North Korea’
We would have entered into war with North Korea.
Millions of persons had been killed.
Now we have this very good relationship -
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results - the end of rocket tests, the help in the release of the hostages and the return of the remaining American vectors home.
And he defended his unusual approach while talking about relations with Kim.
-It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of getting 10,000 people out trying to enter this arena filled with people, we had about 200 people standing there, - said Trump, he and he pointing at the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and Terremot in Indonesia Destroy Island, Kill People's Hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not required.
Even after more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had to move from home, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalysing international aid.
Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it is a challenge to say Ms. Sombung.
While Save the Children is organising a team to travel to Palu, it is not clear whether foreign personnel can operate on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, national disaster agency speaker, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Taking into account the often occurring earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is not yet well prepared for the great anger of nature.
While sheltered by the tsunami was built in Aceh, you do not see them much on the coast.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Plu, despite having issued an alert, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
In the best times, travel between the numerous islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship was posted in Lombok for the care of victims is on its way to Palu, but it will last at least three days to get to the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improvements to the infrastructure falling into pieces of Indonesia, the centre of his electoral campaign, and spent a lot of money on roads and trains.
But Mr Joko's administration sent for lack of funds as he faced his re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from sectoral tensions still in Indonesia, where the members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of this faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to move from home as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the road, using ‘machetes’, bows and arrows and other types of weapons.

Eventually, the ball went down after Kepa Arrizalaga, who went over to try to catch him, and fell into the net.
I was trying to enter that position, to get in to the ball and players like Shaq always send it forward as far as possible, so I tried to give myself time, as much as possible, - Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I've seen Kante come over and touched the ball once and I didn't think about it much and tried to shoot the ball-
Chelsea was winning 1-0 to half the game after bringing 'goal' in 25 minutes by the very good Belgian player Eden Hazard.

The state of the Cromwell Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the argument about ‘recast of history’
Its removal would be a form of justice appropriate to the destruction in a manner similar to that of the Taliban, of most of the English religious and cultural legends carried out by its fantastic ‘Puretan’ followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestion as being crazy - and an attempt to rewrite history -
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace would have become a target.
The ‘iconoclast’ of the British civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Crowell would have been sacrificed to the actions of his sister Thomas in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Sir William Hamo Thornecroft of Cromwell is evidence of an opinion of the 19th century and part of the historical of a figure that many believe is still worthy of celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: -Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monument.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-century conflict of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure that is recognised as representing one side of that division.
Its achievements as ‘Lord Projector’ also deserve honor and honour -
Killer Killer Attacker and Kill Chinese Farmers
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig on a market in South-East China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname -Yuan, - was found dead with a cut-off artery, covered with blood next to the Lupanshui market in Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in hoggery on 30 May 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
Supposedly, he travelled with his cousin from the province near Yunnan the Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found dead, and found a door to the pig's bag in the open vicinity.
He said that there was a pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had attacked and killed the farmer, according to the report.
The surviving legs were bloody and mutilated, the cousin said, who referred to him with his surname.Wu, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
The film of a safety camera showed Yuan coming into the market on 4.40 a.m. morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was not Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was arrested not to attack others, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking people have been recorded previously.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the husband died critically.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg kept a farmer from Wales with his tractor until he expelled the animal his wife.
After the pigs of a farmer from Orgon attacked him and ate him in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pigs are not usually aggressive but the taste of the blood can act as a ‘cause’.
They're playing.
They repent, they are very curious... they do not intend to hurt you.
Only you want to show them the appropriate amount of respect, - he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring a heavy rain across the south-east of the United States
As predicted, Uragan Rosa is being weakened as it moves on colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring a flood across northern Mexico and south-east of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa brought a wind of 85 mph, Category 1 Uragan, on 5 a.m. in the morning at the time of the East Sunday, and was 385 miles in the direction of the south-west of the Eugenia Point, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it is forming a ‘trop on the Pacific Ocean’ and is moving east to the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa is approaching the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm it will start pushing a strong tropical humidity in the north-west direction to the south-west of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain into parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching “trough” creates a heavy rain in the south-east in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inch of rain will cause a rapid, dangerous flooding, residue flows and a possibility of ranges in the desert.
A strong tropical humidity will cause rain rates to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour into parts, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
From 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in parts of South-East, especially on a large part of the Arizona.
The rapid flooding is possible under conditions which are rapidly deteriorating due to the widespread character of tropical rain.
It would not be a good idea to emerge in the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
A heavy rain may cause the canyons to become dangerous rivers and storms will bring very local inflatable winds and dust.
The ‘trough’ will bring some rain to parts of the southern coast of California.
A total of more than half inch of rain is possible, which can cause small bursts and slides.
This would be the first rain in the region of their rainy season.
Some tropical rain duplications begin to move to Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rain spreads in Fort Corners on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October there may be some sharp temperature changes around the US as the Arctic cools, but tropical areas remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature in short distances.
There will be a great example of dramatic temperature differences from the US Centre on Sunday.
There is almost a difference in temperature of 20 degrees between Cansas City, Messouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the coming days, the summer heat that will continue to try to develop and expand.
A large part of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a hot start in October at 80s-wide temperatures from the South Plates to parts of the North-East.
New York City may rise up to 80 degrees on Tuesday, approximately 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate high possibilities for temperatures above the average for the East of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen the Brest Kavanagh hearing
More than 20 million people saw the very interesting Thursday witness of the nominated candidate of Supreme Court Bett Kavanawagh and the woman who accused of committing a sexual attack alleged to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political fight continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming with the shocking news of the last minute on Friday: an agreement drawn up by the Secretary of Arizona Jeff Fleke for the FBI to conduct a week's investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Committee of the Senate that it is certain 100 percent that Kavanawagh babasha when he was under alcohol influence and tried to remove the clothes when they were a post-secondary school-level festival.
Kavanawagh, in a passion witness, said that it is 100 percent certain that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday are likely to have seen it.
The company was counting the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks which showed them, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fax Business Network.
And Nielsen usually finds it difficult to calculate how many viewers are from offices.
To put this in perspective, it is a size of an audience similar to that for the decisive football game or for the Academy Awards.
In addition, the Commission notes that, in the light of the above considerations, the Commission considers that the aid granted to Kavanaugh does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.
ABC was right behind it with 3.26 million viewers.
BS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Fleke was the central figure in the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, those who protested by the cameras of CNN and CBS were caught on Friday morning and were calling on him as he tried to go up to a hearing of the Committee of the Judiciary.
He remained there standing with his eyes looking down for several minutes as he was aggressively criticised, in a direct broadcast on CNN.
You're standing here in front of you, I said a woman.
Do you think that you are telling the truth to a country?
They have been empowered when many women have nothing to do with it.
Fleke said that his office issued a declaration and said, before closing the doors of the lift, that it would have more to say at the committee's hearing.
All cable and broadcasting networks were broadcasting directly, hours later, when the Committee of the Judiciary had to vote to advance Kavanawagh's designation for the Senate fully for a vote.
But Fleke said that he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the person nominated the following week, that democratic minorities have been encouraging.
Fleke was partly convinced of conversations with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several years later, Fake took his decision.
The Fleke decision was empowered, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanagh.
British Prime Minister May pleads for criticism that are taking advantage of the policy - on Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused the criticisms of her plans to leave the European Union taking advantage of the policy and undermine national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview after her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson pressed his attack on the so-called 'Chequers' Plan for Brexit, and said that a proposal that Great Britain and the EU should collect each other's fees was completely gardened.
Fire on Wayde Sims: Police arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson after the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in the shooting who killed Way Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and put in prison on charges of a second-grade murder, said Baton Ruge Police Department.
The officials produced a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered glasses from the spot and said they found Simpson DNA on them, reporting the CBS's affiliate, WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted he had shot and killed Way.
Its bond has been set at $350,000, reporting the Advocate.
The office of the Coroner of the East Baton Rouge Parish he issued a preliminary report on Friday, which stated that the cause of death is damage from a gun from the head to the neck.
The department is giving credit to the police force of the Luoisiana State Police, the state police crime laboratory, the South University police and the citizens of the area to assist in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The director of the athletics of LSU Joe Aleva thanked the law enforcement of the area for due diligence and the search for justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The attacker who was 2 meters long, raised in Baton Ruuge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 ‘rebounds’ every game in the past season.
On Friday morning, the coach of the LSU Will Wade's basketball said that the team was located in the metlusts - and was shocked - after the death of Wayde.
-This is what you worry about all the time,’ said Woode.
Vulcan throws the ash on Mexico City
Ash being disposed of by the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern area of Mexico's capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the trailer increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring various tectonic sounds and movements.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash that hit car windscreens in the vicinity of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geography physicists noted an increase in activity in the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) south-east of capital after a earthquake of 7.1 in the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The known volcano has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalonia separateists prior to the independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors in favour of independence had a conflict with the anti-thirty police, and as thousands joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalonia polarisation vote on the succession.
A covered-faced team that was kept back from the anti-scathes police has drained eggs and dust paints, and created a cloud of dark powder on the roads which are generally filled with tourists.
There were also small fighting during the day and the police had to use the bells to control the fighting.
Over a period of several hours, pro-independence groups were migrating - We don't forget, we don't apologize - fight against unionistic demonstrators who were shouting,-Spain for the whole time -
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in protests, reported the local picture.
Pensions remained high in the region which wants independence one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by Madrid but which is celebrated by separationists from Catalonia.
The voters chose to become independent, although participation was low with those against the succession who made a big boycott against the vote.
According to the Catalonia authorities, almost 1000 people were killed last year after the police tried to stop voting at voting stations throughout the region in violent fighting.
Independent groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of national police.
The demonstration was made but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, electricalist who attended the separate protest with his wife said that he no longer hoped in the prospects of Catalonia to achieve independence.
- Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my mother and father weeping with joy that they could vote but now calm down, and he said.
Despite having a vital and narrow victory in the regional elections last December, the parties in favour of the independence of Catalonia are sending to keep the momentum this year with many of their best-known leaders or in the exile that they decided themselves or in detention and are awaiting the process because of their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Juan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone in support of the police, said that the conflict was caused by both sides' politicians.
There's more and more tension, he said.
Saturday, Oriol Junques, one of the nine leaders of Catalonia in prison prior to the process since the end of last year, announced that he would challenge the European Parliament elections next year.
-In order to stand as a candidate for the European elections it is the best way to condemn the aggression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government, - he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car entered a house with strength

The incident took place in Balyngard Crescent on Thursday for the conflict of 19:30 BST.

Menga's Goal wins game 1-0 for Livingston against Rangers
First 'goal' of Dolly Menga's for Livingston winning the game
Livingston, which has been promoted, forgave Rangers and thus Steven Gerard lost for the second time only in 18 games as a coach of ‘Ibrox's club’.
Dolly Menga's ball spatula made all the difference as the side of Gary Holt was equal at the points with Hibernian second place.
The side of Gerard continued to not win out of her grand at the Premiership in this season and the next Sunday will play against Harts, which first sits behind them with eight points.
Before that game, Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna in their grand in Europa League on Thursday.
While Livingston continues not to have a loss in the division in six games, with the Holt main coach that has not yet lost a game since it came instead of Kennedy Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against bulk visitors
Holt's team was about to win before he had a 'goal', with his direct game style that was causing many problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but distributed the ball in front of the stick, then Alan Lithgow could only distribute the ball with a wide body after he snuck to get the ball from a sudden head from Craig Halkett next to the stick.
Those who were playing in their own grand were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, because they knew that they could give the visitors the problems at certain moments.
And that was the way the 'critical goal' came.
Rangers left 'free-kick' in and Livingston took the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to help Menga, who touched the ball and entered the rod from the centre of the box.
By that time, Rangers had dominated the possession of the ball, but they were finding the defence of the team that they were playing in their own grand, non-penetratable, and the 'goalkeer' Liam Kelly had little trouble,
That game style continued even in the second half of the game, but Alfredo Moreelos made Kelly welcome the ball.
Scott Pitttman failed to find a 'goal' because of the 'goalkeper' of Allners Allan McGegor and Lithgow shot the ball widely after sharing another player of Livingston.
Balloons were all the time entering the Livingston box and were always removed from their players, while two requests for 'penalty' - after Halkett's attempt at Glenn Middleton replacement, and another after the ball was touched by a player's hand - were rejected.
Phenomenals from Livingston - analysis
Alastair Lamont of BBC Scotland inside the Arena Tony Macaroni
Performance and phenomenal result for Livingston.
For a man, they were excellent, they continued to go beyond expectations on this path above.
The games style and their staff have not changed much from returning to the main fight, but the most credit should go to Holt for the way he joined the team since he arrived.
He had a lot of hero.
The master Halkett was very great in his games, by organising a very well-organized defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warral with seven eyes.
However, Rangers had a lack of inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at some moments under Gerard, there was a lack of standards this time.
Their last opportunity with the ball was not good - once only managed to divide the defence of the team that was playing in his own grand - and it is a sign for Rangers, to find themselves in the middle of the rating.
Erdogan received different reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) there were people shouting and hearing blue as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - with the aim of correcting NATO's relations between allies.
They did not agree on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and entry of Turkey into the EU.
Erdogan then left to Cologne to open a huge new moskea.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The Police quoted security reasons to block a large crowd of 25,000 people from being collected in front of the Moscow, but many supporters came up close to seeing their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan - many of them Cordi - also mentioned their voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to host them in the country.
The protests against each other reflect the separation of a visitor who is a hero to certain German Turkish and believed to be an “autocrat” from others.

Long Lartin Prison: Six officials are in disorder
Six prison officials were wounded following a disorder in a prison of high-security men, said by the Prison Office.
The disorder started at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire for the wrong of 09:30 BST on Sunday and continues.

And last October the anti-thirty officers were called to prison to address a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with ‘pool’ balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threaten, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with Quick Floods (Drying Zones can benefit)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week as the remaining Uragan Rosa energy moves from south-west, leading to rapid flood risks.
The National Temps Service has already established a rapid flooding watch for Mondays and Tuesdays from Western Arizona to South and Eastern Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including the cities of Phonix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass through a straight line on Phonix on Tuesday, and approach late Monday on rain.
The Phonix National Temp Service noted in tweet that only ten tropical cycles have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression within 200 miles from Phonix since 1950-!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane at 40 miles from the AZ - border.
The latest models of the National Center of Afghans predict 2 to 4 inch of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Arizona Rim Mogollon.
Other South-West Deeding Areas including Central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to be from 1 to 2 inches, with possible isolated totals up to 4 inches.
For those at risk of rapid flooding, the rain of Rosa may be positive as the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, some of this rain is likely to be beneficial as the south-west side is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the drought monitoring device, a few more than 40 per cent of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category, - reported by a waterher.com.
First, the route of Uragan Rosa led to the touching of the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who will be a very powerful hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, will be 385 miles south of Pusa Eugenia, Mexico and will move north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific and therefore loses strength.
Thus, it is expected to touch Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or early in the evening.
Rain in parts of Mexico can be strong, creating a significant risk of flooding.
A rain toll of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to the north-west of Sonora, with a possibility of not more than 10 inches, - reported by a waterer.com.
Then Rosa will move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move from Arizona and south of Utah until late evening on Tuesday.
The main danger expected by Rosa or its remnants is a very heavy rain in Baya California, in the north-west of Sonora, and in the south-west desert of the United States, - said by the National Center of Urbans.
This rain is expected to produce a rapid flood that is life-threatening and crushing flows in deserts, and ranges in mountain terrain.

Mass was killed by the Indonesian earthquake, the tsunami, with the number of deaths that appear to be rising
At least 384 people were killed, many suffered as massive waves fell strongly on the beaches, after a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Suawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to six feet (18 feet) fell strongly on the ground at the time of the darkness, while many were carried and died and destroyed all that was in the middle.
The tsunami took place after a earthquake of 7.5.
-When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not wake up to happen immediately and end up victims, - said Sutopo Purwo Nugro, the speaker for Indonesia's BNPB Disaster Mitigation Agency during a briefing in Jaskrek.
The tsunami did not appear alone, pulled cars, stalks, houses, hit everything that was there on the ground, - said Nugroho, and added that the tsunami had travelled along the open sea with speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before it hit the shore.
Some people went up the trees to escape the tsunami and stayed alive, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air photos issued by the disaster agency showed a lot of destroyed buildings and shops, self-circuit bridges and water-torn muske.
Strong shocks continued to promise the city off the coast on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated in the statement that the energy that emerged from the huge Friday earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
They said that the geography of the city, located at the edge of a narrow and long beach, could have grown the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as اextensive and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels had fallen.
The bodies of some victims were found caught under the crushing of a falling building, he said, adding that 540 people were killed and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 km) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake centre.
Communications - were entirely sent and without information - by Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, - said by the Red Cross in a statement, and added that their staff and volunteers were going to the affected areas.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse, - they said.
On Saturday, the agency was very critical because it did not know that a tsunami hit Paul, although officials said that the waves had arrived at the time of issue of the warning.
In a film of shared amateurs on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard calling warnings with anxiety for the tsunami approaching people on the lower road.
In a few minutes a huge amount of water fell hard on the shore, carrying with it buildings and cars.
The videos could not be authenticated immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a sharp drop in light which reduced communications around Plu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The authorities said that the military had begun sending cargo planes with the aid of Jakrek and other cities, but that evacuations still need food and other basic needs.
The city airport was reopened only for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths well exceeds 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While the staff of the World Vision's from Donggala arrived strong and full in the city of Plu, where the employees were sheltering were armed men's shillings on the grounds of their office, they passed through where devading scenes on their way there, Mr. Dosba said.
He said, “They have told me that they have seen many houses that have been destroyed ”
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups started the unpleasant process of disaster relief, some complained about the fact that foreign aid workers with deep competences were not being allowed to travel to Plu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to enter if the disaster site is declared as a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
In addition to a disaster at the province level, Aulia Arriani said, a speaker for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Since the government says, ‘O.K., this is a national disaster,’ we can bring in international assistance but so far there is no status -
With the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, the friends and family of the missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that inspired this history of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy came out of a sewage.
On Sunday, people who carry out a rescue were free of a woman who was caught under crush for two days near her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national team of Paragliding, had issued two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others caught in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
-As a superior person in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden, - he said.
Mr Gendon related how, in the hours after the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had fallen circulated among the paragliding community, he sent in a way, scattered, messages with whatsApp to the competitors of Plu, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, only marked the departure, but did not mark the arrivals.
I think what means that the messages have not been received, - he said.

Mexico's AMLO promises not to use the military against civilians
The President-elect of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use a military force against civilian persons as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a blooded suicide against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Cup that he would not use the military to restrict the Mexican people.
The troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968, and killed around 300 people at a time when movements of left-students were being established in all Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those who study and open more public universities free of charge.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
The US should double the I.A. funds.
As China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this field, says the investor and practitioners of the IA Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after several parts of the US government made IA notices, even if there is a lack of formal IA strategy in the US.
In the meantime, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be the first in IA innovation by 2030.
- The doubling of the IA research budget would be a good start, since all other countries are far behind the US, and we are looking for the next revolutionary step in IA, - Lee said.
The duplication of funds could double the possibilities of achieving the next majority of the IA in the US, Lee told CNBC at an interview this week.
Lee, whose book -AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order - was published this month by Hoghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent IA companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that won the player with the highest rating of American Othello, and later he was executive with Microsoft Research and president of Google's branch in China.
Lee recognised previous US government competitions in technology such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when it will be the next one, to help identify the next magazines.
Lee said that researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government grants.
Lee said, - It is not China that is removing academic leaders; the bodies are doing so, -
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have employed people to inspire others from universities to work on the IA.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to strengthen their efforts in the IA.
He said, -I believe that the green paper should be automatically offered to people who have Doctorate in the IA -
The State Council of China issued the next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funds to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organisations issue money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence set up a Joint Technical Intelligence Centre, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Selected Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As regards the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in IA research.
In the meantime, the US legislation which tried to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen any action in several months.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country;
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to the Northern Republic of Macedonia, - a step that resolves a dispute that has been going on for decades with Greece that has blocked its membership offers for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbour in its north represents a possible possession of its territory and has made a veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but national opponents argue that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the population of the majority of the Slovenians of Macedonia.
President Gjuge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and a bojkot campaign raised doubts as to whether participation would reach the minimum of 50 per cent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote is read: -You are in favour of membership in NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece -
Those who support the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to enter bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
-I am today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for us all, said Olivera Georgejevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, sufficient members of the parliament said that they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change in name requires a two-thirds majority in the parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that there was no report of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
-I've come to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe, - said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a capitalist, Skopje.
The PM of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country giving him the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was arming a small palm and preparing seats in front of the tents armed by those who would make a referendum boycott.
-We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we need to be proud to enter under our conditions, not by commanding others - said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others such as China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration -
Prime Minister Zaev states that NATO membership will bring the much needed investment towards Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
-I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO, - said Zaev after voting.
He said that a result in favour of the change of name would be a confirmation of our future -
A survey published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research of Macedonia said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum - an amount below that of the required participation.
Another survey, carried out by the Macedonia TV Telema, found that 57 percent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the participation shall be 50 per cent and one more vote.
If the referendum fails, it represents the first serious step to government policy in favour of Western ideals from the moment it took control over its hands last May.
See: Sergeio Aguero, the player of Manchester City, passes from all Brighton defence to ‘goal’.
Sergeio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke up Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday in the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his goal in 65 minutes seem very easy.
The attacker from Argentina received a ball from half the grand at the beginning of the sequence.
A run from between three defenders of Brown before a neighbour into a wide open space.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players with green seals.
Fighting with one defender before fleeing from much more to the edge of the Brown box.
Then spread the ball on his left and found Sterling.
The English attacker first arrived at the ball in the box to distribute it to Aguero, who used the right foot to insert the ball into the right side of the net by passing it from where the Brighton Mathew Ryan goalkeer.
Aguero is sending problems to his feet, saying City Pep Guardiola's coach to journalists.
We talked about the fact that he was going to play 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We had the good luck he did 'goal' at that moment-
But it was Sterling that gave the initial advantage to Sky Blues in the fight of the Prizer League.
That “goal” took place in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball in many of the territory of Brayton in that action.
Send the right ball to Loroy Sane with the left side in a very nice way.
Sane touched the ball just before it led to Sterling where the fleet.
The attacker of the Sky Blues touched a little ball and entered the net just before sliding into a territory that is not supposed to enter.
City will play against Hoffenheim at the stage of the Campion League groups at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play in Spoiler vs. Rockies
Since Nationals were eliminated from the possibility of competing in the decisive game, there was no reason to make an effort to restart.
But the player so competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to be the ‘pitcher’ on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that the Rockies have the possibility to play in the decisive game, which is before the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West with one game.
The Rockies managed to get a possibility to continue to compete with 5-2 against the Nationals this evening, but they are still looking to get the first title of the division.
In the event that we are playing for nothing, we can at least have the possibility to win by knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be playing at the highest level of any point I can face this year.
What do you not want to compete in those circumstances?-
Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but are allegedly inclined to allow Scherzer to be the ‘pitcher’ in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting for the 34th time, held a practice session on Thursday and will be playing as a pitcher on Sunday when he is usually resting.
The player from Washington who plays with a right hand is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 ‘strikeout’ at 220 2/3 ‘innings’ in this season.
Trump’s manifestations in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation relating to the selection for his Supreme Court, Brett Kavanawagh speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
In November, everything we have done will be threatened.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is very big -- Minix challenges, but in truth, I'm arguing, so I'm running around fighting for very good candidates, - he said.
-We are seeing this very rare and radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now, - continued Trump.
And they are determined to take back power by using all possible means, you can see the green one.
It does not matter who is hurt, who wants to be proud in order to gain power and control, what they want, power and control, we will not give them -
He said that the Democrats have a mission to resist and prevent -
And I've seen it over the last four days, - he said, and he was calling the Democrats - angry and green and disgusting and dishonest -
He referred to the Democratic Senator classified in the Committee of the Judiciary of Senate Diane Feinstein on his behalf, and received a lot of negative cries from the audience.
Do you remember her response?
Have the Document been issued?
Uh, uh, what is it.
No, oh no, I expect, first of all, the movements of her body were not positive at all - the worst movements I've ever seen -
The Labour Party is no longer a wide group.
Not to tolerate its views
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to suspend me, I did not take it very seriously.
After all, I am the most recent MP in a list of Labour Party MPs that were not positively welcomed - because we communicated our views.
My parliamentary colleague Juan Ryan has received similar treatment because he has fought against anti-semitism.
In my case, the motion of censuring me was criticised because you did not agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, notably, issues similar to those on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday announced that they want the meetings to be inclusive and productive -
During the majority of my eight-years as a local Labour MP, the evening General Council meetings were just like this.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a policy - more kind and gentle - that it has been forgotten if, in fact, it has ever actually started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable for the Party's conduct.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I thought I had a similar political view began to expect me to change my views and take positions that I had never agreed with in other situations - both on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and, in truth, it makes no difference what I say - to be followed by abuse of social media with a request to be removed from my post of MP, to condemn the policy of the centre, and to tell me that I do not have part of the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Yes, I know that I have had more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a lot of sexual or racist abuse every day but are never hidden from comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the fact that abuse levels have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that wide group and with any movement of - lack of confidence - or a change in selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
I've been given many advice over the last two years that have encouraged me to keep my opinions for me, not to be so voiceless and then everything - would be right -
But I did not enter the policy to do so.
Since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, I have argued with Thatcher's government negligence that left my comprehensive school class literally in a disastrous state, seeking to improve public services for those who need them most - either as local councillor or as government minister.
I never hid my policy, even in the election that passed.
No one in Nottingham East could have been, in any way, confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who have promoted the motion on Friday, all I say is that when the country is moving to Brexit that will harm our families, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in truth, the only message that I have is for Nottingham Momentum, is for my constituents, whether or not members of the Labour Party: I am proud to work for you and promise you that no amount of threats to be removed from my office or of political motivation discourages me from acting in those that I believe are all your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, not yet lost once, rises to the top of the rating
Two attempts could have changed a little the result, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this exciting day game of the Tenn's Premiership.
Currently found first in the rating, the only team from all ten that did not lose once.
Finally, it was the superior defence, as well as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities, which helped the team, who was playing in his own grand, win, and the coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
We've been through trials during our games so far, and we haven't lost one yet, so I'm happy, - he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said: ‘The credit given to Ayr, they took advantage of the opportunities better than us’
With the attempt of Grant Anderson's in the 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Climo, Ayr were winning, but, a yellow card from the head of Scotland Roy Houghs, which was allowed to play the game from the Warriors, gave Melrose the opportunity to try and Jason Bagot made a non-converted attempt.
Clemo extended Ayr's victory with a ‘penalty’, before, in the middle of the exact game, made a ‘goal’ and converted an individual attempt to the points 17-5 to Ayr into a panic.
But Melrose started the second part of the game well and the attempt of Patrick Anderson's, converted from Bagot, reduced the gap by 5 points.
Then stopped the game because of a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which came out of the grand on a strezer, and as soon as the game started again, Ayr continued to take the points after an attempt by Stafford McDowell, converted from Climo.
Then, the head agent of Ayr Blair Macfeerson was given a yellow paper, and once again, Melrose came out aggressively when making an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, after a period of hard pressure.
However, the team that was playing in his own grand started to attack again, and when a yellow card was given to Stran Hutchinson for the action he did on Climo without the ball, from the line of the ‘penalty’, MacPherson touched the ball with the ground at the back of the Ayr group that was advancing.
Clemo converted, as he did for a while almost from the area from which it started again the game, after that Kyle Rowe collected the ball that David met Armstrong from inside the box and sent Gregor Henry, to play with the side, for the fifth attempt of the side that she was playing in her own grand.

'The sea is our': Bolivia, which is surrounded by the earth, hopes that the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
Seafarers watch the naval headquarters equipped with ropes and chains in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue ocean flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered by the Motto:-The sea is our right.
Recovery is a duty
Around the whole Bolivia, which is surrounded by the ground, the lost coastal memory of Chile in a bloody conflict of 19th century resources remains clear - as the wish that Bolivians can sail to the Pacific Ocean again.
That hope is perhaps at its highest in decades, as Bolivia expects a decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
- Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and sereneness, and is obviously waiting for the result with a positive intent, - said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ's decision on large country-wide screens, with the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will find, in favour of Bolivia's statement, that - after decades of irregular talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate and give Bolivia sovereignty for the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's indigenous president - who is facing a controversial battle for his re-election next year - also has much to lose in the Monday's decision.
We are very close to getting back to the Pacific Ocean, and he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia - and that little change would do so.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant Chilean territory, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
That the ICJ judgment reaches only six months after the final arguments were heard, indicates that the case - it was not complicated - said Paz Zárate, an expert from Chile in international law.
And far from having Bolivia’s case celebrate, the last four years may not have been helpful.
The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration, said Zárate.
The hostile rhetoric of Morales has weakened any residual Chilean goodwill, it suggested.
Bolivia and Chile, at some point, will continue to speak, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions after this.
Both countries have not shared ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile - and the opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits - he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who is still one of the most popular Latin American presidents - was using the maritime issue as political aid.
Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean, - it added.
The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past -
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can trust the US
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Young Ho states that his nation will never disarm nuclear weapons is the first if it cannot trust Washington.
He had spoken on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to carry out the promises made at a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
According to the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, it appears that it is due to resume the nuclear diplomacy that has been suspended more than three months after Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Re states that it’s a dream - that the continued sanctions and the United States’ objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will never force North Korea to surrender.
Washington is concerned about whether to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang making the first significant steps of disarmament.
Both Kim and United States President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is serious to renounce an weapon that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The performances of the Paris fashion reveal the latest collection of massive head-to-head clothes that will soon be seen at the main shops.
If you want to add to your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you can stop looking.
Valentino designers and Tom Browne revealed a range of strange and very large head clothes for their Spring and Summer 2019 collection on the route that won the set of the style in Paris Fashion Week.
Not many practical hats are very visible on Instagram this summer and these designers brought up their surprising creations on the palm.
The article most frequently mentioned by Valentino was an extravagant beige convulsant with a large feathers-like edge that completely covered the heads of the models.
Other very large-size accessories included beans coated with cheeses, a hat and even ananas - but are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Browne also revealed a choice of strange masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Most of the coloured masks had cut lips and were more like Hanibal Lecter than 'haute cuture'.
One reaction resembled the complete oatmeal device with snorkel and goggles, while the other was similar to that of dissolved ice cream .
And if it continues with this good luck style.
Those who follow the fashion predict that huge soon ‘bonnets’ will appear in the main shops.
The very big hat comes out after the release of 'La Bomba', the hat of the straw with a wide edge of two steps worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The 'Cult label' responsible for the hard-looking hat which has been shown to be very much on social media has brought another big reaction on the stage - a straw bag containing almost as much as the Maltese dress model it was carrying.
The dark orange cover basket, surrounded by the small slag of the soil and a white leather sacrament, was the most prominent creation in the 2019 Spring and Summer collection of Jacques in Paris Fashion Week.
A famous Stilist Luce Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I'm waiting to see hats and large sea bags in major shops for the next summer - since the designer has made a huge impact, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for very large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
The independent schools of Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent examination results, which is only strengthened with individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalised school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain the subject of a popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak a man in a language that he understands, you understand with his mind.
If you speak in his own language, you understand with his heart -
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examinations, we can see that languages are leading in the classification tables with the highest rates of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages achieved higher A grade.
The data, collected from the 74 schools that are members of the SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students achieved higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students also obtained A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now, as a subject option, are maintained in the same respect as STEM subjects (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that from reasons given employers to the fact that they are sending to fill job vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more imperative to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Irrespective of the career to choose, if you learn another language, this will have a real advantage in the future as it has the ability to stay in such a lifetime.
To be able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically put a multilingual person at the forefront of competition.
According to a survey of YouGov of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation and, by 15 percent, French is the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits.
That is why investment in language learning is now important for today's children.
Knowing more than one language, particularly those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding significant work.
In Scotland, every school will learn different languages.
A number of schools will focus on more traditional modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, there will always be a number of languages that they can choose in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
The Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future.
It cannot currently be rejected, in a global business environment, that languages remain very important for the future of the country, and therefore this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered as - international communication skills -
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scotland.
The funt bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Independent School Council
On Sunday LeBron will play for the first time with the Lakers in San Diego
The sports supporters of LeBron James no longer have much to wait for for the first time for Los Angeles Lakers.
The coach of the Lucers Luke Walton announced that James would play in the game of opening before starting the season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the amount of minutes it will play still needs to be determined.
It will be more than one and less than 48, - said Walton on the official Lackers' website.
Lakers Mike Trudell's journalist wrote a story that, likely, James will play a limited amount of minutes.
After the practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six pre-Lakes season.
In my career stage, I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself, he said.
Trump’s management in West Virginia, Youtbe Canal
President Donald Trump starts a wave of manifestations of the campaign tonight in Weeling, West Virginia.
This is the first manifestation of Trump from five scheduled next week, including stops in amicable places including Tennessee and Missippi.
With a suspended confirmation vote for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the next mid-term elections as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in Nov.
At a time is the manifestation of Trump in West Virginia tonight and how do you see it online?
The manifestation of Trump in Weeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, 29th September, 2018.
You can see the manifestation of Trump in West Virginia online below by direct broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for the nomination of the Supreme Court Bett Kavanagh, who became intense due to allegations of sexual misconduct with an early confirmation vote of the Senate suspended up to one week while investigating the FBI.
But the primary objective of this wave of manifestations is to help the Republicans face the November elections to achieve some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that these five manifestations next week are aimed at giving energy to volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, - according to Reuters.
-The Congress Control is so important for this agenda that the president will travel to as far as possible as possible as we are near the season of the campaign, - he told the Reuters a speaker for the Trump campaign he said he would mention.
A schedule for the Wesbanco Arena in Weeeling, the night's demonstration can gather supporters from Ohio and Pennylvania and attract coverage from the media of Pitsburgh, - according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump will be visiting West Virginia, the state that won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate of the Republican Senate of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is losing in the survey.
It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to give him a boost in the survey, as Simon Hader said, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States Team determined to be non-retardable while moving to Sunday singles
After three sessions of one side, Saturday's furours could have been exactly what it needed this Ryder Cup.
The passage of momentum is a concept of sport completely invented but one that players really believe in, and never more than in such competitions.
So where do they say it is the momentum now?
These were in front with six points and are now four, so I think we're carrying it as a little momentum, ’ said Jordan Spieth as he left during the day.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, four fronts with another twelve to play.
The Americans, says Spieth, feel but have a little obstacle and have a lot to encourage them, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each of them opens with three points from four.
Spieth was accurate from tea to green and is leading by example.
That cry from the heart of a celebration continued to grow as he continued his round, by making a crucial Deputy to bring the fourth equal game when he and Thomas were two under two.
His driver who won the game on 15 was welcomed by a similar call, the kind that tells you to believe that the American team is still there.
“Vera must enter into the depth and worry about your own item,” said Spieth.
This is what each of these players has now lost.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the uncontested history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but sweet couple of Europe are four with four and are considered perfect.
-Moliwood - were the only pair that did not solve a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided lunch on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and 9:00 in the morning.
That run, and the way their energy looks like it moves to and from this life pool sets out that they are the players that are challenging on Sunday, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European win as the sun falls on Le Gulf National from Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both suddenly on different holes.
But here we are talking about an early European glory.
The Watson and Simpson Dob quickly completed by Sergeio Garcia, the morning football hero, when he was placed in a pair with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the front ninth put Spanish and Swedish in a hole they never got near to get out of it.
But Sunday, there's no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fouringballs and furorsoms are very fascinating to see them closely due to peer interactions, advice they give, advice that they do not give and how a strategy can change in a second.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is leading on the final day but this session of the forwards has also shown that the US Team has determined that some, especially on the part of the US, were in doubt.
Europe in front with 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take good advantage of the final day of the Ryder Cup after it came out of the parties to the 10-6 front fora on the United States of America.
The inspired par Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made the two-winning effort on Tiger Woods that found it difficult to take their score so far forward at Le Gulf National for four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, ready to keep the trophies lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American side that went wrong in morning bowls, which took the series with 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the fuorsoms, by winning two items, but could not reach the difference in the score.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from the 12 items of one Sunday's player to keep the trout.
Fleetwood is the first new European for the season that won four points behind each other while he and Molinari, vaccinated - Molliwood - after sensual weekend are only the second pair that won four points from their four opening items in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After dominated on Woods and Patrick Reed in the bowlballs and then worked excellently to win the unoptimised Woods and the new American player for the Brasson Dechambeau season with an even more empatic score of 5 &4.
Woods, who found difficulty in both Saturdays, showed occasional moments of pride but now lost 19 of its 29 items in the bowls and the forwards and seven behind each other.
Justin Rose, released for morning bowls, returned to Henrik Stenson's partner in the forwards for a 2 & 1 loss of Justin Johnson and Cooks Koepka - who are first and third classed in the world.
It was not everything, however, what Europe wanted in a beautiful day, with a slight gap in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a big winner for three times, and Justin Thomas set the threshold for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They achieved a courageous victory of 2 & 1 on John Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the warballs and returned later to win Poulter and Roy McIllroy with 4 &3 in the furorsoms after losing both opening holes.
It was only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team returned from a difference of four points while it was entering the singles, although the holders of the Furyk side need a draw to keep the trout.
However, after being the second best for two days, Sunday’s attack appears to be more than they can do.
North Korea says that in no way will it unilaterally dismantle without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister said to the United Nations that continued sanctions were deepening its lack of trust in the United States and that there was no way that the country would have unilaterally left its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Young Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world's body that North Korea had taken considerable good will measures - last year, such as setting up nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site, and promised not to promote nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we do not see a corresponding response from the US, he said.
In the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no way disarm ourselves unilaterally first -
While Ri repeated familiar complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a phase-by-step approach to denuclearisation in which North Korea was rewarded as it takes gradual steps, its statement seemed significantly not to have refused unilateral denuclearisation without thought as Pyongyang had done in the past.
He referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a United States president serving North Korea's duties and leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula - while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea was looking for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that Pyongyang first wanted to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also maintained calls to reduce the severe international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States insists on denuclearisation first - and increases the level of pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their objective in a co-sound manner, and also objects to the declaration of the end of the war, said Ri.
The perception that sanctions can break us is a dream of people who do not know about us.
But the problem is that ongoing sanctions are deepening our lack of trust -
Ri did not mention plans for the second Kim and Trump summit that the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: ‘If the party to this question of denuclearisation were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have arrived at such a block.
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the United States continental ground with North Korea rockets was inevitable after Mr. Katy-Trump called on Kimel of rockets on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take steps to dismantle, but said that much work remains to be done and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea denuclearises.
Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this, saying - If it takes two, three years or five months - it doesn't make a difference -
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Thursday, told the UN Security Council that: -The enforcement of Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and without stopping until we realize the fully and finally verified denuclearisation.
The Security Council unanimously reinforced the sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with a view to setting up funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly and later said to visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, after a few hours in North Korea criticised for making requests like gangster.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes corresponding measures.
He said that Kim had told him that the corresponding measures - he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students do a course on taking enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has been able to make all its students who have not yet graduated to sleep more with the aim of fighting growing macho culture to study all night and remain raised by caffeine.
A academic has found that students at the university in the first place in the world often have no idea about real basic things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham Hospital and Women's Hospital, drew up the course, which he believes is his first type in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after he gave a speech on the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
and said: ‘Why are you telling me this now, in my last year?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - that surprised me, - told the Telegraph.
The course, which began for the first time this year, explains to students the essential things about how good sleep traditions help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a psychologist at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after she found that students had serious insomnia during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a classroom where students sleep, where students click on coffee cups, blinds, tractors and books to capture the effects of caffeine and light and on how athletic performance has an effect on sleep shortages, and the routine importance of sleep time.
In another section, participants are told how long-term insomnia may increase the risks of heart attacks, seizures, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with an interactive size, urges participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that students’ behaviour is not going to change immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know - as much as you have the right to know the effects on health when you choose to smoke cigarettes, - added the Czeisler Prof.
The culture that would be proud to be able to keep you up all night studying - still exists, he said, while adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that insomnia was a growing problem.
Ensuring that it sleeps sufficiently, and of good quality, it should be the secret weapon of a student to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to prevent weight gain, as the lack of sleep puts the brain in hunger mode, which makes them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler draw up the course, after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard's first year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to strive for a course all over the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students who have graduated to make a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
The Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider making alarms when they go to sleep, as well as when they wake up, and know about the harmful effects of blue light - which comes out of the electronic screens and LED light, which can balance your circadian rhythm, and lead to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga’s goal hinders the men of Gerard
Rangers suffered another sad period when they played abroad as the striker of Dolly Menga delivered Steven Gerrard's separated side for a loss of 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox side was looking to record their first victory while travelling from February 4-1 triumph in St Johnstone, but Gary Holding's team only caused Gerard's second loss in 18 items as a manager to leave his side eight points away from the great leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership, Harts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half-time and the list of inspirationless Rangers' players never seemed to have met.
While Rangers now come down to the sixth place, Liveston goes up to the third and only after Hibernian on a gowl difference.
And there may be more trouble for Rangers after the linesman Clum Spence had to be treated for a wound in a chair after apparently drunk an object on the side of the supporters of the team who played outside his country.
Gerard made eight changes to the side that passed from Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Harts last week and was pleased to see how his well-trained form constantly obstructed their opponents.
Rangers could dominate the possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They had to pick up only two minutes from the start when Menga's first-time play-off sent Scott Pitttman to a Golder of McGregor, but the mixer took his great chance.
Free-kick's strong Keaghan Jacobs then found the Spyer Craig Halkett but his defender partner Alan Lithgow could only slap from the back.
Rangers got the control but it seemed that there is more hope than belief about their game in the third final.
Certainly Alfredo Molelos felt that he had to have a penalty on the 15-minute mark as soon as he and Steven Lawless fought but the referee Steven Thomason ignored the appeals of the Komobian.
Rangers managed to target only two shorelines in the first half of the item but the previous goalkeer of Ibrox Liam Kelly hardly worried him at the head of Lassana Coulibaly and the light track of Ovie Ejaria.
While the first pursuit of Levi in the 34 minutes might have been when the other team was playing better, no one could deny that he only wanted them for their effort.
Again, Rangers failed to manage the good set-face of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher cast the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga to end the action.
Gerard reacted in the brake by changing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change almost provided an immediate impact as soon as the spell-blower in Morellos but the Kelly-Jere impressives from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors to play exactly the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Hallet that caught a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's side could extend their position in the lead in the final stages but McGegor was well kept to reject Jacobs before Lithgow went to the open corner.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton had a further delay request for a penalty as argued with Jacobs but again Thomason looked at the other side.
Almanac: Geiger Container
And now page from our Al-Sunday Morning's Al-Amanak: 30 September, 1882, like today 136 years ago, and WE GIVE ... the day on which the future physical Johnnes Wildm-Hans-Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, an invention which eventually led to the apparatus known as Geiger Content.
Since then, the Contituent of Geiger has also become a cornerstone of pop culture, such as in the 1950 film - Bells of Coronado, in which those unlikely cowboys scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans appear:
A man: What's the man's name?
Rogers: -Dik Geiger Contituator, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When wearing these cuffs, you can actually hear the effects of the radioactivity atoms in the minerals.
Evans:-Say, sure it's popular right now!
Hens-Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he reached 63 years of age.
But the invention by his name remains alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see - cells with abnormal behaviour
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see - cells with abnormal behaviour and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour as part of the treatment
Method involves the extraction of immune cells by a patient, changing into a laboratory
These can then be seen - a protein common to many cancers and then re-injected
Trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A vaccine-treated woman, who teaches the immune system to recognise cells with abnormal behaviour, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells by a patient, changing in the laboratory to be able to see - a protein common to many cancers called HER2, then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a highly promising vaccine -
HER2-stimulating growth of various types of cancer, -including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells by patients and how they are taught - how to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of leukaemia.

This Is Not Good
Kanye West was booked in the studio at Saturday Night Live following a confusion performance in which United States President Donald Trump commended and said he will be released for election in 2020.
After singing his third night song, called Ghost Town, in which he was wearing a belit of Make America Great, he began to say against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
Many times I talk to a white person and say: ‘How can Trump, that racist?’
If you were concerned about racism, I left America, - he said.
SNL initiated the programme with a commandeer who appeared to Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star rediscovered the Burt Kavanawagh declaration before the Senate Judicial Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.

West has deepened many with the performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West has been supported by the president of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter:
But the presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply the one that he and this is a great thing.
But I did not choose to reward someone (by buying music or his clothes or supporting his art) who believes that he is embracing and spreading an ideology that is detrimental to my community.
It's free.
So much so that we have, ” she added.
Prior to the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that it was now the one previously known as Kanye West -

The star of Game of Thrones Kit Harington speaks of toxic maculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role to swipe the sword as John Snow in the series of violent medioval fantasy of HBO Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor spoke about the stereotypes of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that the young man often feels that he wants to be violent to be respected.
Speaking with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believed that something had gone wrong - and had doubts about how to address the toxic maculinity problem in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his curilla of Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he had strong interests - to address the issue.
Often, I feel that I have a strong interest, right now - where did we go wrong with masculinity?
- What were we teaching men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we now have?
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through its very male characters.
He continued: -What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes the young man feel that they want to be this certain side of a man?
I think this is one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because it's very clear that something went wrong for the entrant -
At the interview he also admitted that he will not make prequels or Game of Thrones' series when the series comes at the end of next summer, by saying that as such wars and horses -
Since November Kit will appear in the new True West production of Sam Shepard which is the history of a film producer and his brother, a link.

I met my wife on this programme, so in this way he gave me my future family, and my life from here on, he said.
Rose interpreted the part of Ygrritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, John Snow, in the fantasy series that won in Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in the land of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, say health officials.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people taking HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health officers at a conference in the Yunnan province.
However, one year later, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV from sex is an acute problem in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was criminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is said to be common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most transmissions of disease stem from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of staff revealed GOP senator data, says - dangerous lies - and conoffe theories.
The United States Representative Maxine Waters has condemned allegations that a member of her staff has replaced the personal information of three years of the United States of America on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles has ascertained that the claims were being disseminated from foundations and websites of the right-hand side.
For example, in the United States, it is estimated that more than half of the world's population live in rural areas, and more than half of the population live in rural areas.
The information allegedly released included home addresses and telephone numbers of United States Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate board hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against the nomination of the Supreme Court of Katitol Hill.
The disclosure was made some time after the three years of questioning Kavanawagh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the places was associated with Waters' office and released the information of a member of Waters staff, reported the Hill.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and absolute lie, - continued Waters.
-The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - in no way has he been responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and absolute lies -
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticism online, including from the previous press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer.
This rejection is one of anger, - wrote Fleischer.
This suggests that it does not have a delay in being a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he shall not be angry.
It must not be resistant.
The reasons of the accused shall not be questioned.
It should be calm and seren -
Fleischer appeared to have been comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanawagh's Democrats, who was accused of criticism that seemed too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will be issued to take the Waters seat in the mid-term elections, also heard his voice on Twitter.
That's something big if it's true,’ he said on Twitter.
In its statement, Waters said that her office had warned the appropriate law enforcement authorities and bodies about these fraudulent claims.
We will ensure that authors will be identified, - continued, - legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to each and to all of my staff -
Critical of Johnny English Stricks Again - Rowan Atkinson, imitation of healthy spine
It has now become traditional to look for Brexit's meanings in any new British-looking film and this seems to be applicable to the return of the franchise of an action-community of Johnny English - which started back in 2003 with Johny English and took life again in 2011 with John English Reborn.
Is irony self-sustaining the subject of how clearly we are wrong, would it be the country's new export opportunity?
At any rate, the incompetitive Johnny English with great eyes and parts of his face moving not as usual had the renewed licence for the second time to do everything wrong - what his name is more than anything else shows that it is a widespread, harmonious creation designed for regions of non-English-speaking cinema.
It is, of course, the supposed secret agent who, despite his strange claims to his sweet pubs, has a few of Cluseau, a hit by Mr. Bean and a large part of that man who contributed one note to the Milodia of the theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony in London.
He is also originally based on the international travellers and man of mystery who once atkinson had made his part in the advertising of Barclycard TV, today forgotten, after he left a case behind.
There is a nice moment or two in this last issue of JE.
I liked the moment when Johnny English had moved to an helicopter while he was dressed with a medile-co-racted dress and the edges of the cracks caught with his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's gift to the physical community seems, but humor feels rather poor and overly strange, especially since the film marks - such as 007 and Impossible Massion themselves offer the comedian as an ingredient in a confident manner.
Umorism is felt as if targeted at children than for adults, and for me the strange unfortunate incidents of Johnny English were not as effective and focused as the silent film of Atkinson in Bean's person.
The perennial topical assumption now is that the Great Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker filtered the very secret network of British spies, by revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, for the disappointment of the agent who was at work - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the cherries on the cake for the first minister who is an impeccable and difficult figure, which is already suffering from a complete collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson makes her best with this character looks like Teresa May but there is not much in the script to work.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that each active symphony has been compromised, will have to get a retired person.
And this means the incompetitive Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in an elite building, but giving non-official lessons on how to become operational infiltrate: a few good jokes here as English offers a school-of-Rock-type examination academies.
English is returned to Whitehall for emergency meetings and joins his former associate of great patience, Bough, interpreted again by Ben Miller.
Bogh is now a married man, with a submarine commander, a famous role of one interpreted by Vicki Pepperdine, in which she is a little washed up.
The two inseparables that always mix everything in its Order Service of Bibleity, are back in action, when they meet with the character of a woman's generous and beautiful Ophelia Bultova interpreted by Olga Curylenko.
In the meantime, the first minister falls under the control of the freshwater billionaire who insists that he can solve the problems of the British computer: the master Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bogh start their journey of fun farming behaviour: dressed as wipers, fire to a high French restaurant, create caos to climb up on the luxury boat of Volta; and English starts a full anarchy as he tries to use virtual Realty offices to familiarise himself with the interior of the Volta home.
Certainly all stops lead to that last sequence, but as amicable and animate as it is, it has a little idea of a child television.
Something quite moderate.
And like the other films of Johnny English I couldn't think: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really deserves his talent?
Lebanon rejects that it is preparing a plan for British to work for a week of four days but is paid for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is expected to consider a radical plan that will see the British work four-day week - but is paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the company teacher to pass on the residue from the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to workers by giving them another day's savings.
This would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but still take with them the same wage.
Sources said that the idea would be hot - with the economic agenda and plans of the party that the country moved in favour of workers.
The shift to one week of four days was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way of taking advantage of the changing economy.
Senior Officer of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: - Waiting for a policy review to be announced before the end of the year.
This is not going to happen tomorrow but a four-day working week is an inspiration for the party's approach to rebalancing the pro-employed economy as well as the party's global industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to approve such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, the aspiration is currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party speaker said that: ‘The four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it’
The Opposition Facilitator John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to take back power from anonymous directors - and take-overs - in utility firms.
The opposition's trigger plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take their full share back as the Labour government can make a reduction - on the basis of perceived misbehaviour.
It also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Growth Funds to provide 10 per cent of private sector firms' equity to employees, ready to take annual dividends up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells 60 Minutes - whether the Kavanagh FBI investigation can change their understanding
The FBI’s investigation of the charges against Judge Bette Kavanawagh delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court in a week, and raised the question whether the findings of the Bourau could influence a Republican citizen from withdrawing his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, the 60 Minutes correspondent asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would lead them to change their understanding.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague than South Carolina.
Get up, and be sure, ’ said Kennedy.
I said and entered the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanawagh.
I called him after this happened, after having issued that allegation, did you say, “Hold her? ”
He was resolved, determined, inequative -
However, Graham's vote seems difficult to change.
I've already decided about Bert Kavanawagh and must be a very big accusation, saying.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Bett strongly rejected it, - increased Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And every person mentioned cannot verify this.
This is 36 years of age.
I saw nothing new change -
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done something to reduce Poverty?
Next Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an impressive list of stars that will appear and an equally impressive mission; to end world poverty.
Now, in his seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people returning to the Central Park Great Lawn to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Span Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the true purpose of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Government Project, a representative group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless I was ready to pay a VIP ticket), those who were going to the concert had to finish a series of tasks, or actions - such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a call or some other significant ways to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen with the remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
The idea that people are rewarded with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade people to call for action, or is it only another case of so-called \"clicitism\" - people feel that they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a gift?
Since 2011, Global Citizen states that it registered more than 19 million actions - than those who put it, which I stand for a number of different objectives.
This says that these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37 billion which are expected to affect lives of over 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announced its actions, at least $10 billion of which were already distributed or collected.
The group estimates that the secure funds have so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the sick.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementrs committed to help children grow to their full potential, - with the promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 claims from Global Citizens.
- With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens such as you, we can make the social injustice of nutrition note at the bottom of the story, - said the ambassador of the Power of Nutrition Traffic Ulman to the crowd at a direct concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following more than 5,000 actions to invite the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and a child with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequent questions on his website you ask - what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?
Global Citizen replied: “Ser be a long, hard journey - sometimes we will lose and fail.
But, like large civil rights movements and against apartheid, we will succeed, because we have greater power when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Sun Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the artists who will appear at this year's event in New York, who will present it to Debore-Le Furness and Hug Jackman.
United States uses the Navali Fleet for blocking - to hinder Russian energy exports - Internal Secretariat
If necessary - Washington can resort to its Navali Fleet to prevent Russian energy from affecting markets, including the Middle East, reveal US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's enlargement in Syria - especially, where it operates with a legitimate government invitation - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
-I believe that the reason that lies in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern side of Europe, - allegedly said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of addressing this.
-The United States has the ability, with our Navali Fleet, to ensure that sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy did not reach the market, he said.
Zinke was addressing those who attended the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that stands for itself as the energy consumer’s voice - in the US.
He continued to compare Washington's approaches in addressing Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
The economic choice on Iran and Russia is, to a small extent, fuel leverage and replacement, - he said, referring to Russia as someone with a single capacity - with an economy that depends on the fuel fuels.
The following statements as Trump's administration was on a mission to strengthen its export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, by replacing Russia, the much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of the Trump administration, including the United States President Donald Trump himself, try to pre-empt Germany to exit the gas project - inappropriate - Nord Stream 2, which according to Trump, made Berlin the district of Moscow.
Moska has often insisted that the Nord Stream 2 gas of $11 billion, which is expected to double the existing gas capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
In this respect, the Commission considers that the Commission considers that the aid granted by the State under Article 107(3)(c) of the Treaty to be compatible with the internal market is incompatible with the internal market.
In the opinion that we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers, the Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main organisation for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), invited the United States to move away from Europe's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
-I have a major problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply, - said Peter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Canceller Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Ser-Treaty Whether to issue for President in 2020, Says the Senator of Massachusetts
President of Massachustes Elizabeth Warren, Saturday said that he would examine us carefully - whether he would come out for a president after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting of the council in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed to consider leaving.
The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government and this includes a woman in the highest position, saying, according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will examine whether we are going to be presidents -
Warren commented on President Donald Trump at the council meeting, saying that he was taking this country in the wrong direction.
I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy, saying.
Warren was direct in Trump's criticism and his nomination to the Supreme Court Bett Kavanawagh.
On Friday, Warren said - naturally we need an investigation of the FBI before the vote -
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that a majority of Waren's own constituents do not think it should be released for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of voters - likely - of Massachusetts said that the senator should not go to the election, according to the survey of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe's Political Research Centre.
Thirty-two percent supported the election issue.
The survey showed more support for the election issue by former Governor Dev Patrick, with 38 per cent to support a potential election exit and 48 per cent against him.
Other Democratic high profile names discussed in relation to a potential release for the 2020 election include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he officially decided until January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin refers to the PTSD of Track Palin in the appearance of Donald Trump
26-year-old Palin Track, spent one year in Iraq after being registered in September
He was arrested and put on domestic violence incident on Monday night.
In what is being built, what is going on after he's returned, I can relate to other families that feel the ramifications of the PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers return with, - told the audience in a demonstration for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paulin called his arrest as the obvious problem that no one is addressing - and said about her son and other war vectors, - they return a little different, return stronger, stop thinking if there is that respect for what other soldiers and air personnel, and every other member of the military, gave the country--
He was arrested on Monday in Wesila, Alaska, and was put on a domestic violence attack on a woman, interrogating with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennet, a speaker for the Willa Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports a challenge for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District are supporting a legal challenge for a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district, Friday brought a court friend case in Washington to support a politically challenging asylum seeker reported NBC News.
The full name of the actor in the Grace case against Sensions submitted by the American Union of Civil Liberties in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner - and the boys members of his violent gang - abused her but United States officials rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
It was held in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, producing a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, as nations are facing violent problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy lifted a 2014 decision by the Board of Migrant Appeal which allowed undocumented immigrants to escape from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Friday, in a statement, the Attorney-General of the District of Colombia Karl Racine said that the new policy - ignores decades of state, federal and international law -
The Federal Law requires all asylum claims to be judged on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such motivation violates this principle, stating the case of a friend of the court.
The lawyers continued to argue in case the policy that denies immigration income damages the US economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and provide the necessary work -
Advocate General Jeff Seseons ordered immigration judges to cease granting asylum to victims who escape from domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
-Employment is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion, - Sensions said in his policy announcement on 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts deployed in Palu as the number of deaths doubles in fighting the time to find survivors.
For survivors, the situation has become increasingly terrible.
It feels very intense, - said 35-year-old mother Rissa Cosuma, while she was embracing her baby with fever in an evacuation centre in the sad city of Plu.
Each minute ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is scarce -
Residents appeared to return to their destroyed homes, looking in their things burned with water, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, destroyed by the earthquake of a size of 7.5, were too full.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture in his home and shoulder, remained outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to ongoing health shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he reported that he felt the violent earthquake moving the hotel floor on the fifth floor he was using with his wife and daughter.
There was no chance to save ourselves.
I was crushed with the remnants of the wall, I think, ‘Haris told Associated Press, and added that his family was in place for a wedding.
You heard my wife cry for help, then silence.
I do not know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope to be safe -
The United States ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ with propaganda adverts.
One week after an official Chinese newspaper released an advert on four pages in a daily US newspaper trying to sell the reciprocal benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The President of the United States Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to China Daily's paid supplement at the Des Moines Register - the newspaper that is being sold most in the state of Iowa - after he accused China of seeking to enter the US Congress elections on 6 November, accused China of rejecting it.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections marked what US officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in a launching campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to make advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a deteriorating trade war that they have seen passing through tariff rounds on their respective imports.
China's retaliation fees at the beginning of the commercial war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa who supported the Republican Trump Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Brand, the US ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods for China, said that Beijing hurt workers, farmers and American businesses.
China, wrote Brandt on an opinion page on Sunday's Des Moines Register, - now doubles this billing by making adverts in our own free picture -
In the dissemination of its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the precious tradition of America of free expression and the free press by placing a paid advert in Des Moines Register, - wrote Brandstad.
In contrast, on the stand of newspapers down the road here in Beijing, you will find voices of limited dissemination and you will not see a true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people can have on China's problematic economic path, as the media are under a restriction of the Chinese Communist Party, - written.
He added that - one of China’s most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish - its article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are instigating Women Voting prior to the Half-term Elections in the Kavanawagh debate, August the Analysts
As many Republicans of the top are supporting and defending the nomination of the Supreme Court Bett Kavanagh while facing various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that they would see an adverse reaction, particularly during the next mid-term elections.
The views on this were very high, and most of the Republicans are already officially showing that they wanted to run by vote.
These things can't be reversed, - he said Grant Reher, professor of political science at Siracuse University School to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reher said that he doubted that the last minute push of Senator Jeff Fleke (R-Arizana) for an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
- Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or November, - said Karen Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators sang - November! - as they protested to the Senate hall as soon as the Republicans who are controlling the Judicial Committee decided to run with the designation of Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, reported Mic.
The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high, saying St. Rothenberg, a non-partician political analyst to the news site.
The people are saying that they were already high; and true.
However, they may be higher, in particular between female voters who turn votes in subbores and smaller voters, 18 to 29 years old, whereas the president does not like them, they often do not vote.
Former President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
This has become a full join-up to the GOP, - said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
This concerns not only the vote of the committee or the final vote on whether Kavanawagh is placed on the bank, but also how the Republicans managed this situation and how they dealt with it, - indicated to the news station Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect the Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somehow divided over those who believe in the light of Ford and Kavanawagh's statements, with little more support for the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents firmly or probably believed the Ford declaration, while 35 per cent said they firmly or probably believed the Ford declaration.
Moreover, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying during his declaration, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the push by Fake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations brought by Ford as well as at least other accused, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed before the Judicial Committee of the Senate under an oath last week that Kavanagh had attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that the nomination of the Supreme Court exposed his genitals to it while they were in festin at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Inventor plans to start a New Internet to compete against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the operator of the World Wide Web, will launch a new business that seeks to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The final technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company building on the open source platform Bernners-Lee solid.
A solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people are allowed to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Bernners-Lee pointed out that the intention behind Inrupt is the world's domination -
We need to do it now, saying about the new business.
This is an historic moment -
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal data shop or PDO.
This may contain contact lists, lists of what to do, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spofty are all available on one browser and all at the same time.
What makes the single personal online data shop is that it is completely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls this the personal autonomisation using the data-
The idea for Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is that the company brings adequate resources, process skills and skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform brought by IBM, some staff developers who have a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
By starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether they should introduce a complete change where all their business models are turned down from today to tomorrow.
We are not asking for their permission -
On a website published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid.'
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when it set up a World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee was a voice of influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am very optimistic for this next web era, - added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Clerical Celebration of Victoria Cross of the First World War
The only clergy of the Church of England who won Victoria Cross during World War I as a rival was celebrated in his village 100 years later.
Lt Col Il-Reverend Bernard Van won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack in Belinglglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he won the highest British military honor.
The Saturday revealed a commemorative stone from its two Novembers in a pair in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, said that he was - brilliantly symbolic - that the stone had to be revealed exactly 100 years after the achievement of the victory of the prize of nannuah.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt Cur led his battle against the Canal de Saint-Quaentin in many rounds and fire from rifles on the ground and machine guns.
Later he rushed to the line of fire and with the greatest courage - led the line forward before he went to a rifle on the spot alone and lost three of their consciousness from the troops.
Lt Cur was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just one month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72-year-old, said that the actions of Hannah were something I know I can never get there but something very generous.
He and his brother Dr James Vann also put a girlanda after the bulkhead, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was - is feeling very honoured to play a role in this bulkhead - and added - the courage of a genuine hero was being shown by the support that will be given by many people -
AMMA supporters remained awake all night to see Bellator 206, instead of ending with Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you've been awake all night to see Bellator 206 packed to end up denying the main event.
The list by San José included 13 battles, including six on the key card and were being displayed directly during the night in the UK on Channel 5.
On 6am, as the Gegard Mousasi and Roy MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the United Kingdom remained shocked when the broadcast was changed to Pippa Pig.
Some were not impressed after being raised up until the early hours especially for the fight.
One party on Twitter described the change to children's cartons as some kind of crate-
It is a government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was not appropriate so they had to switch to children's programmes, - said Dave Schwartz, vice-president of the Bellator's marketing and communication when asked about the transmission.
Pappa pig, yes
The president of Belator Scott Coker said that he would work on their scheduling to include viewers from the United Kingdom in the future.
I think that when I think about the repetition, we probably can fix something, - Coker said.
-But right there are six mornings of Sunday and we will not be able to arrange until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we are working on it.
From me, when the broadcaster was switched there were many messages going on and not all were sweet.
We were trying to correct the solution, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was not, it was a governmental matter.
I can promise that the next time will not happen.
We will limit it to five battles instead of six - as we do the usual - and we've tried to deliver more to the supporters and instead we've gone too far.
It is a distressing situation -
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly felt - inferior' because of gender
The Olympic Madras Tom Daley says that he felt inferior to everyone because of his gender - but it gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old man said he wasn't realized until he went to secondary that not everyone like me -
Speaking of the first Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the rights of homosexuality to give hope to others.
He also said that when he became a parent he became less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the programme that's been under way, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
While it seemed as a person set aside on the first Laverne programme, Daley said he felt less than others and grew up because - it was socially unacceptable to like you boys and girls -
He said: ‘To date, those emotions that feel less than, and you feel different, have been the real things that have given me the power and strength that I can succeed’
He wanted to prove that he was something - he said, not to question everyone when they eventually became aware of his gender.
The Olympic Bronze Medalist has become a high profile promoter for LGBT for twice and used its appearance in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to describe homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt lucky that he could live freely without ramifications and wanted to give hope to others.
The world winner for three times said that when he became a man - a film producer from the United States, Dustin Lance Back, who met him in 2013 - was surprised to him.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year but said that the difference in age was never a problem.
When passing through so many things so young - went to his first Olympics of 14 years and his father died with cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar beautiful experiences.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his whole perspective - had changed.
If you asked me last year, for me the important was 'I want to win a gold medal', he said.
-You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie-
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 of 40 years after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die and one of the things he had asked was if they had already had tickets for London 2012 - since he wanted to be in the front row.
I couldn't tell him ‘you won't be here to be in the front row, pà’, he said.
“ I was keeping his hand when I stopped breathing and it wasn’t until I actually stopped breathing and it was dead that I finally acknowledged that it was not invincable, ” he said.
The year following Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronchos.
I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - that I was sitting in front of a crowd from countries in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling, he said.
It also inspires the first choice of his song - Proud of Heather Small - that was compatible with him in the march to the Olympics and has yet to start the cold.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday 11:15 BST.
Mickelson who is no longer in shape on the bank in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will make a record on Saturday when he plays his 47 game of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to change his shape to avoid being such an important step as not so much joy.
Mickelson, who plays at the biennal event for a record of 12 times, stayed on the bank from Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's furballs and furours.
Instead of being the centre of action, as it was often for the US, the great five-fold winner split his day between he was fighting and working on his game from the distance with the hope to correct what he was worried about.
One who would never give the ball right even in the mile of his career, the 48-year-old man is not ideal for the difficult path of Le Golf National, where the long distance turned away once after punishing wrong ribs.
And if the course alone is not of cutting the heart enough, Michaelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faces the precise game of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, new for the season, to win all their four games this week.
If the Americans, with four points less than the beginning of the 12 single games, start well, the Mickelson game can show that it is a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
-He fully understood the role he played today, applied me on my backs and put his arms around me and said he would be ready tomorrow, - said Furyk.
It has a lot of confidence in itself.
It is Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I was unlikely to play two parties.
I've seen more, but this is the way it worked and this is the way we thought it would go.
He must be out there, like others.
Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's record for the most items of the Ryder Cup that were played on Sunday.
This can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career which has rather never reached the millions of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halfs, although Furyk said that his presence brought some intangible things to the team.
-It introduces you, serticistic, funny, likes to come in with people, and a very good man to have in the team's room, - explained.
I think the younger players were pleased to criticise him this week, which was something fun to see.
It provides much more than just games -
European captain Thomas Bjorn that the big position in the front can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from the experience that a sizeable front position before the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily be changed into a comfortable journey.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Balsteros held an advantage of five points on the Americans but ended up with a narrow real margin, with a win of 141-2-131-2.
It continues to remind yourself that we had a big front position in Valderrama; we had a big front position in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a few, - said Bjorn, in the press, after seeing Class 2018 win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday to be on a 10-6-day sleeper at Le Gulf National.
So history will show me and everyone in this team that has not finished everything.
Tomorrow you go with your soul and body.
Get out there and make all things good.
It is not yet complete until you have pulled the points on the team.
We have a purpose, and what he tries to win this trophies, and the focus will remain there.
I always said, focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we know well what's on the other side - the world's biggest players -
Content with how his players played on a tough golf course, Bjorn added:-Never go a step oltrè from me in this.
A different challenge remains.
It still concerns the individual performances we see, and this is something different to do.
Very nice to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when there is out individually, then it is tested for your full ability as a golfer.
This is the message you want to pass on to the players, which will issue your best tomorrow.
Now, let the partner follow you and he must leave and leave his best, also -
In contrast to Bjorn, the opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to play better individually than when they did as partners, with the exceptions that they Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have acquired three points from four.
Furyk itself was on both sides of those last days that could change everything, after being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before it ended losing as Europe made the Medinah Memorial.
I remember at least a word from her, saying in answer when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, prepared his players before the last day.
But we have 12 important items, but you would like to give it to him for the first time as soon as you saw him in Brooklyn, as you saw him in Medinah.
When that momentum arrives on one side, place a lot of pressure on those middle parties.
We made our list as appropriate and put those men in the way we felt, you know, we're trying to do a few miracles tomorrow-
Thomas had been given the task of trying to lead the fight back and facing Roy McIllroy in the best game, with Paul Case, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Fuller the other Europeans in the best half of the order.
I went with this group of men in this way because I think it covers all the way, - Bjorn said about his singles choices.
Germany's new war is postponed again.
The newest queue of the German Navali Fleet had to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the ageing war-torn phasers, but there will not be at least until next year due to systems with defects and increasing cost, reported to local media.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the main vessel of the new violent pirates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military speaker.
The vessel had to join the Navali Fleet in 2014, but the post-transition problem issues had led to the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class vessels ordered by the Navali Fleet back in 2007 will be replaced for the old Bremen class framers.
It is understood that they will have a strong cannon, an anti-aircraft missile and anti-ship exhibition as well as some cathelous technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic sireners.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - this should be possible to operate the most new cattle up to two years away from home ports.
However, continuous delay means that the vessels of the last technology - which are mentioned allowing Germany to project power off its coasts - will already be old by the time they enter service, notes Dee Zeit.
The F125 invasion of bad luck appeared last year in news, when the German National Fleet officially refused to commission the ship and returned to Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navali Fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivering.
The reasons for this were little known, but the German media quoted a number of software and hardware defects - crucial to making the vessel useless if deployed on a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessel will be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers - only half of the workers on the older Bremen class frames.
In addition, it appeared that the vessel was well overburdened to reduce its performance and limit the ability of the Navali Fleet to increase future updates.
The Rheinland-Pfalz - of 7,000 tonnes is understood to be twice more heavy than similar class vessels used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it amounted to a sudden amount of €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - from an initial €2.2 billion.
The problems of the most new entrants become especially important in the light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Petter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the National Fleet is currently in a lack of deployment-able ships.
The official said that the problem had grown over time, as old vessels were commissioned but no replacement vessels were provided.
He complained that none of the graduates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navali Fleet.
The National Trust is mentioned on the secret life of the bats at night
New research carried out on the ground in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how the bats use the landscape when they seek food.
It is hoped that the findings will show new light on the behaviour of single mammals to fly and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common pipistrellles and soprano as well as long-born brown-brown bats and Daupinton in the Inverwee June in West Rose.
Special coders will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of the bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-holding detectors.
An expert analysis of the sounds of all the coordinates will ascertain the frequency of the bat calls and which species is doing what.
A habitat map and a report will then be produced which will create a detailed picture of the landscape scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of pastures and how best to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of the bats in Scotland and across the United Kingdom has decreased considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by building and development work affecting cities and habitat loss.
Wind and light turbines can also pose a risk, as can poison paper to capture insects and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
The bats are currently not blind.
However, because of the traditions of their nottorna hunting their ears are more useful than their eyes when they come to catch prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location techniques to indicate insects and obstacles in their passage when flying.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten experts trained, regularly surveying, house inspections and sometimes rescue.
The organisation has even established the first and only reserve for Scotland's overnight bats in the Terreve land in Domfries and Galloway, which welcomes eight of the ten species of the Spaniards of Scotland.
The property manager David Thompson states that the property is the ideal territory for them.
Here in Threave we have a very good zone for the bats tonight, and he said.
We have an old building, a lot of veterinary trees and a good habitat.
But there is much more about the unknown bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about what they need to flourish -
It stresses the importance of checking the bats for maintenance in properties as it is possible that unintended destruction of a single maternity nest could kill up to 400 women and young people, possibly destroying a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, falsify or distress them or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrel, a Scottish officer for the Night Farm Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: ‘We have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we still don’t know how their populations are going.
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations as lawyers are ready to seek a German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo pointed out rape claims against him as false news, - by saying that people must promote themselves - using his name.
His lawyers are expected to look by court at the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The player of Portugal and Juvenus who plays in front was accused of rapeing an American woman, named Kathryn Myorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He alleged that at that time he had paid $375,000 to say nothing about the incident, reported Dr Spiegel Friday.
Speaking on video on Instagram Live with his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, pointed out the reports as false news.
No, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news, - said the winner of Balon d'Or five times while he looked in the camera.
They must promote themselves by using my name.
It is normal.
They must become famous to say my name, but this is part of the work.
I am a happy man and everything goes well, - the player has increased, with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to seek by court Dr Spiegel about the allegations, which they called - inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy, - according to Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player seeks compensation for moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident was reported to have taken place in June 2009 in a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a discotheque, Ronaldo and Myorga allegedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her by the anus, according to documents submitted at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his reptiles after the alleged accident and told her that he was -99 percent - well-informed - disappointed by - one percent -
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that they were both sexually involved, but that this was by consensus.
Myorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of her hospital injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court solution because she felt that she was being seen by retaliation - and was concerned that she would be publicly humiliated -
The 34-year-old woman says that she is now seeking to switch the solution as soon as she is still being treated by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo had come to join Real Madrid by Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer followed the legends of Italian football Juvenus in an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom always regrets losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom always regrets - if it loses its status as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, he said the Secretary of Business Greg Clark.
He added that it was a concern - that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
We need an agreement, Mr Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of a delay at the borders in the case of Brexit of no agreement would cost employment.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Auris and Avensis of Toyota - produced almost 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
-My view is that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March we will see a stop in production at our factory, - said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's management director in Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Mini plant for one month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the case of Brexit of no agreements.
Toyota’s production line today works on an exactly timely basis - with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for cars carried out in order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a border disruption that the industry states could lead to delays and gaps in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep an inventory of more than one day at its Derbysshire plant, said the company, and therefore the production was discontinued.
Mr Clark says that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is -capped precisely to avoid these border controls -
We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement to allow, as I say, not just the success to enjoy at present but to seize this opportunity, - told BBC Radio 4 Today.
The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we need to always be able to continue what was a major success set of supply chains -
Toyota could not say for how long production was stopped, but in a longer period, it warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvlaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the contender of the union Unite at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: (In my experience when these jobs leave, never return.
A government speaker said: -We have submitted a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU -
The Trump meeting with Rossentein can be delayed again, says White House again.
The risky meeting of Donald Trump with the Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rossenstein can be delayed by another week - as the fight on the candidate of the supreme court in Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the White House Sunday.
Rossentein handles the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's aid and Russia and a potential obstruction of justice by the president.
If Trump is to be exonerated by a general lawyer or not, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, he has been forced to flee from Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rossentein discussed wire clothing to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by means of the 25th amendment.
Rossentein rejected the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, although there were reports he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, which was then the United Nations in New York, which was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said that he would prefer not to expel Rossenstein but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid being disappointed with the hearing of the Senate judicial committee containing Kavanawagh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom gave evidence.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh over a period of one week, which delayed a full vote of the Senate.
Sunday, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When asked about the Rossentein meeting, she said: “It has not been set a date for this, it may be done this week, and it may take the following week for all other things going on with the supreme court.
But now we see and I always love keeping the picture up to date -
Some journalists challenge this claim: Sanders has not organized a press meeting in White House since 10 September.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of the meetings was not due to a lack of grace with TV journalists - trying to attract and influence the audience - although she said: “Once I agree with the fact that they try to attract and influence the audience -
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press be added.
The president makes more questions and answers than any previously agreed presidents, - added that she is without quoting any evidence:
The meetings will still continue to take place, said Sanders, but - if the press has the chance to ask questions directly to the US president, this is too much better than talking to me.
We try to do this a lot and have seen us do this many times in the last few weeks and this will replace the press meeting where one can talk to the US president -
Trump rarely answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when he visits the dynamics.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he behaves relaxedly and sometimes strangely before groups of journalists.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about British-related fears
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the gratitude and desire of the country that they remain behind the Brexit.
Jane Freeman MSP sent a letter when it remained less than six months for the United Kingdom to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to entering into the cost of defined status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: - Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue continued, moving towards decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK Government was also increasing its preparations for a possible scenario of no agreement.
I know that this is certainly a difficult time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to insist now on how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from across the EU, and beyond, bring with them valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and to benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we wish you a lot to stay here -
Christation Abercrombe does Emergency surgery After Rasu’s injury
The linebacker Christi Abercromie of the Tennessee State Tagers had an emergency surgery after he suffered an injury in Saturday's head when his team lost against the Vanderbilt Commodores with 31-27, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The main coach of the State of Tennessee Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time.
-He went on the sideline and like he fell there,’ said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff gave oxygen to Abercromie on the sideline before they put it on a stracer and took it back for further examination.
According to the information provided by the Commission in the opening decision, the Commission considers that the measures taken to implement this Decision are incompatible with the internal market and are in line with the internal market.
Harris added that there is still no detail about the type/extent of the injury - and Tennissee State is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in the second year of the suspended university, is in his first season with Tennessee State after leaving Illinos.
Saturday in total he had five clicks before he came out of the game, which led to the total of 18 tackle of his season.
Foreign buyers will be required to charge more toll tax when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged more toll tax when buying property in the United Kingdom with extra money used to help homeless persons under new Toy plans
This change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The tax increase in stamps will be imposed on non-tax payers in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects it to rise to £120 million a year - to help homeless people
Today Aresa May will announce that foreign buyers should pay a higher tax rate of stamp when buying property in the UK - with extra money used to help homeless people.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high pay earners.
The tax increase in stamps will be imposed on non-taxable individuals and firms in the UK, with extra money boosting the Government's efforts to combat road sleep.
The additional charge - which is additional to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second houses and rental purchases - could be three percent.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to £120 million per year.
About 13 per cent of the new building properties in London are purchased from non-UK residents, which are increasing prices and making it harder for new buyers to take the first step in the accommodation purchase phases.
Many rich areas of the country - particularly in the capital city - have become - fantastic cities - because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time abroad.
The new policy was issued just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a tax reduction of the ball so that more young people could help us buy their first house.
He accused large construction firms that were maintaining high property prices by taking and not using land, and urged Ms. May to abandon allowances on affordable housing in order to remedy the situation of housing deprivation - in the United Kingdom.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed house reforms which affect the eye, including checks on rent and the end of removals - without any fault -
He also wants to give the councils great powers to build new houses.
Ms May said: - Last year I said that I would devote my job to restoring the dream of the United Kingdom - that life should be better for every new generation.
And this means adjusting the broken market of our housing.
The UK will always remain open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, find it easy to buy houses as much as the United Kingdom's lazy residents.
For many people the dream of having a home has become too far away, and the dignity of sleep on the streets remains very real -
Jack Roses:-My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland -
The head of Sanderland Jack Rose says that his fundamental ambition - is to become the manager of Scotland ever.
The 42-year-old Skopje welcomes the challenge of re-launching the North-East club, currently in third place in League One, with three different points from the one in the first place.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after guiding St Mirren back to the Iscotish Premiership in the last season.
I wanted to play for countries as a player.
I found B cap and nothing more, Rose told Sportsound of the BBC of Scotland.
But when I was still a child, I often went with my father to see Scotland play in Hamden, and this always remains the thing that attracted me back.
However, this opportunity will only come if I succeed in managing a club -
Those who came before Ross as manager of Sanderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Alardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says that he was not concerned about the fact that he would follow such established names in such a large club, while previously refused the offer by the City of Bernsley and Ipswich.
As of now, will success for me be based on the possibility of bringing this club back to the Premier League?'
In view of the structure and facilities of this club there is no doubt that this club belongs to the Premier League, he said.
It’s not easy to get there, but I probably think I've succeeded here only if I can take the club back there’
Ross has been in his career for only three years as manager, after a period of Assistant Chief in Dombarton and having spent 15 months with Herts' conscription staff.
He then helped Aloa recover from the army for the third category, and transform St Mirren from the edge of the party to the winners of the title of the championship the following season.
And Rose says that now is feeling more comfortable than he was feeling during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkerk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
As regards when he took Alloa in his hands, he recalled that - this was probably a big change -
I thought that the post of manager was the most suitable for me, much more than that of a player.
This may sound strange by going well, having a decent living, and enjoying some reasonable achievements.
But games can be difficult.
There are many things you have to go through every week.
Still I still experience this in terms of work stress and pressure but I simply feel that the post of manager is suitable for me.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I feel that throughout my entire adult life now I'm feeling the most comfortable -

Survey finds that the best time to take a beer pin is 5.30pm of evening
The summer heat wave has boosted the return of the UK pubs in difficulty but has put increased pressure on the restaurants of the same company.
In July, groups of pubs and bars saw an increase of 2.7 per cent in sales - but figures revealed that restaurant earnings decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a CGA of advice for businesses, who collected figures, said: “Sustainable noise and longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar model for the previous month, when sales in pubs increased by 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were even more affected.
The 1.8 per cent reduction in restaurant trade in June further worsened in July.
The pubs and bars the main sales of which are drinks were the ones that did best in terms of financial results compared to the previous period while the restaurant sales decreased.
Pubs whose main sales are food have also suffered in heat, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out drinking.
In the pubs and bars managed the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, while the food fell to three per cent -
Paul Newman, one of RSM's analysts on entertainment and hospitality, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social events or sports remain the largest factors with regard to the market sales of take-aways.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent a year after a year will be particularly burdensome in addition to continuing cost pressures.
The hot and long summer could not be worse for operators whose main sales are food and only time can advise us whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the necessary rest -
The growth of total sales in pubs and restaurants, including opening up start-ups, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow pace in starting start-ups.
The monitoring of the sales of the Coffer Pech Tracker industry for the UK pubs, bars and restaurant sector collects and analyses the performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined revenues of more than £9 billion, and is the established industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts hiding from their parents
Survey reveals that one in five children - some of them 11 years of age - have secret social media accounts hidden from their parents and teachers
Surveys of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the Insta page
News has major fears that sexual content is being displaced
Twenty percent of students said they have a key account - to show their parents
One in five children - some of them 11 years old - are creating social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid growth in Insta’s bills - site reference for the sharing of Instagram photos.
News has major fears that sexual content is being displaced.
Twenty percent of the students said they have to operate a key account - presentable to show their parents, while having other private ones.
A mother who met with her 13-year-old child's secret site found a young woman who was urging others to rape her - -supupponi -
Research, by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters - and Headmistries - Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of young people aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, half of whom admitted to keeping private accounts.
The head of HMC Mike Buchan said: -It is worrying that many young people are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them -
Elidh Doyle will become the voice for the athletes - on the Scottish Atlantic board
He was elected to the Scottish Atlantic Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most athletic of the race and not of the race that won the most medals and the president Ian Beattie described this change as a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from her vast experience at international level over the last decade.
Eildh is very respected in the Scottish athletic community, the UK and the world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by becoming part of the board, - said Bertie.
Doyle said: ‘I am looking forward to acting as a voice for athletes and hope that I can really contribute and help lead sport in Scotland’
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 metres in the 1996 Games in Atlanta among its total of four Olympic Games gold medals and which is now a regular BBC criticism, ended up not moving after having suffered a small stroke.
On Twitter he wrote: “As a month you give me a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors have said that only time can advise us whether or not I recover or to what extent.
It was a tacky job but I recovered completely, I learned how to re-sustain and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thanks to the encouragement messages!
Breast pump advertising comparing mothers with cattle gives rise to different opinions online
A breast pump company has given rise to different opinions online with advertising that compares breastfeeding mothers to fugitive cows.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered to be the first wearable, non-distorted breast pump in the world, Elvie’s consumer technology company has released a broadcast inspired by an iron music video to show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers using the breast pump.
Four real mothers bury in a maw filled with cattle's straw with a disc that includes allica, such as: ‘Yes, I milk myself but I don't have a tail’
The corus continues: -Pump out, pump out, I'm hoping for my babies, pumping out, pumping out, I'm milking my women -
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, the video received different reactions from viewers, many of whom claim that it sheds light on the territory of the dairy industry.
Someone wrote -It was a very wrong decision that cattle were used for advertising this product.
As they need to be pregnant and breast-feeding in order to produce milk, except that their babies are taken within a few days of giving birth.

Someone else commented: “One understands that this is a traumatic thing for both the mother and the baby.
But why do we not use them to publicize a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?'
Someone else added: ‘Reclaming really cut out of reality -
Others defended the discharge, with a woman admittances that found the disc very fun-
I think this is a genetic idea.
If I still drank, I would have bought one.
The pumping had made me feel the same as a cow.
The advertising is a bit or too beautiful but I've taken of it.
This is a gynaec product, - written by someone.
Someone else commented: -This is a fun advert aimed at mothers who pump (often on their workplaces or toilets) and feel like cows.
This is not a advertising that praises or judges the dairy industry -
At the end of the video the women's group revealed that they were all dancing with the non-slip pumps placed in their brains.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their husbands say they feel like cattle.
However, the Elvie Pump, does not make any noise, has no wire or tube and stays in a breast-feeding needle without giving in the eye, thus giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even leave while they are pumping.
Anna Balarin, a partner and ECD in a commented Moher: -The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a courageous and procautical launch.
By comparing women using the breast pump with the dairy cows we wanted to focus attention on the pumping of the breast and all the challenges it brings, showing in a different and related way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump appeared on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the catwalk for Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Masses of Migrant Children Lonely to the Texas Border Camp
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply, although monthly border crossings have not changed too much, partly due to the fact that rhetoric and severe policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to put children together with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and feared that if they presented themselves to take care of a child would endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their poultry would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, witnessed before the Congress that the agency arrested tens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
In the case of an individual who is a sponsor or a member of the sponsor's home, or who is a member of the household of a member of the household of a member of the family, the person who is a member of the household of a sponsor is a member of the same family.
Therefore, we continue to seek these individuals, Mr Albence said.
In order to make the process involving children faster, officials have introduced new rules which will require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, instead of 60 days later, which was the previous standard, depending on the workers of the shelterers.
Many will appear through a video telephony conference, instead of personally, to bring arguments in favour of their case for legal status to a immigration judge.
Those considered ineligible for aid will be transferred immediately.
According to the xelter workers and the reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the more children are kept under custody, the more likely they become anxious or troubled, which can lead to their violent expression or attempt to escape.
The lawyers said that these concerns would increase in a larger facility such as Toronto, where signs that a child is finding it difficult are more likely to be ignored, because of the size of the facility.
They added that the movement of children to the city of tents without giving enough time to prepare emotionally or without telling their friends the strength of the trauma that many of them are already fighting.
Syria tells the occupying forces - the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
While addressing the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moalem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's war now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as a deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on the Syrian territory, with the excuse of the fight against terrorism, and will be properly addressed.
They must withdraw immediately and without any condition, saying to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war against terrorism almost ended - in Syria, where as of 2011, more than 360,000 people had died, with other millions being moved from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight this sacred battle until we have been expelled from all Syrian territories - both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence -
The US has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, many of whom train and advise both the Korean forces and the Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war destroyed country.
With regard to the refugee issue, Moualem said that the conditions were right for them to return, and fixed - in some Western countries - for spreading rational fears - which led refugees to stay far away.
We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return, he said.
They are politicizing what is to be a purely humanitarian matter.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is political agreement between Assad and the opposition in order to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major strong Illib rebellion has created an opportunity to continue the political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces supported by the Russians on the province, where three million people live.
However Moualem stressed that the agreement had clear deadlines - and expressed the hope that military action would target immigrants including Al-Qaida-related fighters, who would be destroyed.
UN dispatch Staffan de Mussura is hoping to call shortly the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the panel should be restricted to the revision of the articles of the current constitution - and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Mandate
With this logic, Mr Trump will win the re-election in 2020 provided that, as they hope, many liberal viewers, denunciation and scandal finish their presidency earlier.
What no doubt is the most dramatic final that has ever been in residence!-
So far, viewers seem to have not been like yet.
As of 2014, time ratings with the largest number of viewers increased by more than double to 1.05 million over the CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on the MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in time with the largest number of viewers, more than 1.7 million of four years ago, and MSNBC’s Rachel Madow Show has increased cable television ratings as well as 3.5 million viewers on key news nights.
This is a situation that you are attracting people because it's not something to understand, as Neal Baer said, a presenter of the ABC drama programme - Deigned Survor - about a secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of the Veteran comedys and author of the Just the Funny Partys: And a Herd Trusts About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys - Club, has another theory.
She recalls in a ride with taxis in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote Mr Trump.
She asked.
He said, “Why did I smoke,” said Ms Scovell.
In this case there is a entertainment value.
No doubt, unlike anything else on TV, the titles of the stories from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can re-unite and the health of the global economy.
To ignore what is happening around you is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And, however, this goes beyond being a informed citizen when in the six months you will be following a panel of experts discussing the use by Bob Woodward of sources - with a deep background - for his book -Fear, - the brain jacket with the skin of the sheep (the clothes reflecting pride, - said The Washington Post) of Paul Manfort with a value of $15,000 and the implications of the descriptions of Mr. Trump's anathem's tactics by Stormy Daniel.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
This is the case in the United States, which is the first of the most important countries in the world.
You cannot afford to lose one episode because you otherwise fall back.
When I contacted Mr Fleiss this week, outside of the weather it was an 80-degree sun on the north coast of Kauai, but it was locked inside to see the MSNBC while recording the CNN.
He could not be removed from the front of television, not when Bict Kavanawagh was ready to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
I remember when we were making those exciting programmes and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilisation,’ Mr Fleiss said.

Large amounts of money received from outside to the most stringent racing in the White House mid-term election
It is not surprising that the 17 Pennsylvania contours are seeing a large amount of money, thanks to the realignment of contemporaneous districts that have acquired two operators in a race for the same seat.
This has recently re-established the peats of the Pittsburg suburban district, Democratic Representative Conor Lambb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is issuing as a candidate against another operator, the Republic of Keith Rothmus, currently representing the 12 old provinces of Pennylvania, which extends much over the 17 new districts.
The maps were re-established after the January Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided that the old districts have been held in an anti-constitutional manner in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the 17 new districts offered a difficult competition for the financial campaign between the finance weapons of the main party, the Democratic Campagign Progressal Committee (DCC) and the National Republican Campagign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennylvania after winning with a slight difference in the special March election followed by much for the 18th Contituent District of Pennylvania.
That chair was a republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political criticisms gave the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered to penalise El Salvador Talli Support to China, and then decided not to do so
The Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little aid from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump held a reception with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and had a hotel in Panama until some partners expelled the management team of the Trump Organisation.
The officials of the State Department decided to re-contact United States heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on recent decisions to stop recognising the Taiwan, said the speakers of the Heather Nauert department, in a statement at the beginning of this month.
But the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which in 2017 received approximately $140 million in US aid, including narcotic controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have weighed the country of Central America and its high unemployment and killing rates.
As internal meetings began to make progress, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year which was considered a step forward in efforts not to go to the US.
But by mid-September, senior management officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with a view to effectively ending any consideration of the penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence was strongly criticised to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the administration has placed on the meeting, said the diplomats.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new and hard message or punishment from Washington.
Speaker of the White House, Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were supported by a foreign analyst who is close to the administration and also spoke of the condition of anonymity.
History Study
The next unexpected negative event could be the report of the Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible disruption of justice by Mr Trump, on which there is now very substantial evidence in the public register.
It is reported that Mr Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr Trump's campaign was agreed with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In the event that the Congress goes to another person, Mr Trump will find himself responsible in that body, as soon as he prepares to go back to the voters, and perhaps a jury of his peers.
This involves a lot of uncertainties, and I do not aim to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - nor his equivalent in Europe.
There are choices that should be made by all on both sides of the Atlantic which will affect how long the fight is to be fought.
In 1938, German officials were willing to carry out a cup d'état against Hitler, which would have the West had they resided and supported the Czechoslovaki in Munich.
We did not succeed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of massacre.
The course of history revolves around such inflection points, and the inexhaustible path of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Today Americans face many of these inflection points.
What will we do if Mr Trump dismissed the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rossenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr Mueller's investigation?
Rossentein has been in problems since this document reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be recorded secretly and that he is not suitable for the post.
Mr Rossenstein said that the Times report is inaccurate.
How will we respond if the investigation of the F.B.I. a new applicant of Bette Kavanawagh is incomplete or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual behaviour and dishonest testimony?
And above all, in half the terms we will vote for a Congress that will hold Mr Trump responsible?
If we do not pass these tests, it will take a long time to move in democracy.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadors' home.
She managed to live, move to America and, 60 years later, on the day of worship of God sent me to light the candles on that table with swaths.
With such heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?'

Graham Durrans of the Rangers is optimistic before the competitive game with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against Austrians, after the impressive equal result they brought in Spain against Vilarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League Group G.
An injury to the knee prevented the midfielder Graham Dorans from making his first appearance of the season into the equal result of 2-2 with Vilarreal but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a catalyst for great things.
This was a good point for us since Vilarreal are a good team, saying the jury of 31 years.
We came to the game with the belief that we could get something and came up with a point.
We were likely to win last but, all of all, an equal result was probably a fair result.
Probably they were better in the first half of the game while we went better in the second half.
Thursday will be a big European night again.
We hope that we can get three points but this will be difficult because they have had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd after us, I am sure we can keep doing our best and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, between everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but despite this, there is currently a sense of satisfaction.
The team is good and the boys are having a lot of fun; the training is good.
I hope we can now do our best, forget the last season and succeed -
Women are concerned about this fear related to retirement savings
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be supervised, a few people were talking to their family members about this.
Around half of the subjects in the Nationalweide study said that they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they spoke to their children about it.
People want to be a family member who notices them, but they are not taking the steps to make a conversation, - said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationalweide's life insurance business.
You should start this way.
Talk with your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes well before time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you will receive treatment, as those options can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Get your financial adviser: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid money-saving policy to help cover these costs or make self-insurance with your own good - provided you have the money.
Take a decision after discussing your legal documents in the long term: Avoid legal battles.
Find healthcare care care to select a reliable individual to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
In addition, consider a proxy for your finances.
Choose a person who trusts to make the financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you are incapacity.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan to be ready.
-Not only are the finances involved, but who are the doctors? - Martin said.

Terremots and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by earthquake and a strong tsunami that hit the city of Plu in Indonesia on Friday, said the officials, with the number of deaths expected to increase.
In addition, the Commission considers that the aid is compatible with the internal market and that the aid is compatible with the internal market.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
These are some major facts about Pal and Donggala, about the island of Solawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawesi, located at the edge of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Suawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit the city, it was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a growth that extends more than 300 km (180 km) of the coast in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
Restitution, administrative region under province, had a population of around 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and farming are the pillars of the economy of the Central Province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mine is also important in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Moorian, on the other side of Suawesi.
According to the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia, Plu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also hit the western side of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Semitic Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a large earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh province of Indonesia on the top of Sumatra triggered a tsunami hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of healthy earthquakes hit the west coast of Somatra at the end of March and early April.
He died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Terremit with a power of 6.8 hit the southern part of Java, which is Indonesia's most popular island, which triggered a tsunami that hit strongly on the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: Terremot with a power of 7.6 struck close to the city of Padang, capital of the western province of Somatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: Armed with a strength of 7.5 struck one of the islands of Mentawai, beyond Somatra, which triggered a tsunami with a height of 10 metres that destroyed tens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: Low earthquake hit Pidie Jaya’s renaissance in Aceh, which caused destruction and panic as people remembered the earthquake and deadly tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunamis were triggered, but more than 100 were killed because of the damaged buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the top of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of temporarily isolated tourists.
Grand Child of Sarah Palin Arrested on a Domestic Violence Accuses
In addition, he is responsible for the activities of the Taliban.
Palin, aged 29, was arrested by Wesila, Alaska, on suspicion of domestic violence, which interfered with a report of domestic violence and which survived the arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when female consciousness tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her the phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su Pretreal Facility and is held on an unsecure bond of $500, reported KTU.
He appeared to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself - certainly, not guilty - when asked to give his motivation, reported the network.
Pauline faces three offences of Class A, i.e. he can stick to prison for up to one year and has to pay a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of a Class B offence, which is punishable by a prison day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that there have been criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veterinary Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of a domestic attack, which interfered with the report of an offence of domestic violence, and which held a weapon in his possession while he was drunk in connection with the incident.
His girl alleged to be her bonfired in her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by the veterinary groups following a comparison between her child's violent behaviour and the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Thermot and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after a earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with a power of 7.5 tsunami triggers and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks do not operate with the number of expected deaths increasing in the coming days.
The earthquake struck only a few outside the centre of Sulawesi located in the north-east of the capital city of Indonesia, Jacard.
Videos that show the moment of impact are circulating on the media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore with great force.
Federal prosecutors are calling for the suspected NYC terrorist attack to be sentenced to a rare death penalty.
The Federal Prosecutors in New York are demanding that Sayfullo Saipov who is suspected of the terrorist attack of the city of New York that killed eight persons is sentenced to death - a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state for a federal offence since 1953.
Saipov, who is 30 years old, allegedly used a rental truck of Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Power Manhattan, by in October pulling the pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov - intentionally - killed the eight victims and intentionally - caused serious physical injuries, in accordance with the notice of intent to request the death penalty, presented in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, these two accused heads carry a possible death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury gave Saipov 22 indictments comprising eight charges of murder with the help of organised recurrence, typically used by the federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
When describing the way in which Saipov carried out this attack - severe, cruel and immoral - the prosecutors said that the attack needed - substantial planning and premeditation -
Notice on intent to declare that-Sayfello Habibulavic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to families and friends of Diego Enique Angelini, Nicholas Celves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Aljandro Damian Pagnicco -
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York that has released a death penalty.
He was found guilty of killing two drug suppliers but finally in September 2009 he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last time that the death penalty was committed in the federal case of New York was in 1953 for Julus and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being found guilty of a conspiracy to carry out a spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were killed by the electricity seat on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remours in the days and months after the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, told the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was eager to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the chief of charge.
He also asked to put an ISIS flag in his hospital room, saying the police.
He replied not guilty to the 22 heads of the charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were certainly disappointed - by the prosecution decision.
We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a ground of guilt for his life in prison with no possibility of release will continue to prolong only the trauma of these events for all who are involved, as Patton said.
Saipov's defence team has previously asked the prosecutors not to request the death penalty.
MP Tory states that NIGEL PARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised to mobilise the people's army.
The former head of the Ukip said that politicians had to feel under pressure - from the Euroseptics - as suggested by one of Theresa May's own MPs that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
The member of the government of the Conservative Party Peter Bone told the demonstration in Birmingham that until now the United Kingdom would have emerged - if Mr Farage had been Secretary of the Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Ms May to reconcile her very shared positions was highlighted by Tories that is not in favour of the Brexit who joined a separate protest against the Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to keep its Chequers compromise plan on track among attacks by the Brexiera, against the Brexit and the EU.
Allieds insisted that despite the negative reaction it would continue to move forward to try to reach an agreement with Brussels - and force Euroseptics and Labour Party to choose between its package and the \"cases\" -
Mr Bone said that he wanted to remove the plan of Chequers.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been given a high social position and that responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he were responsible, we would have been released so far, as he said.
The MP Wellingborg added that it is saying that I will defend the Brexit but that we need to remove the Chequers plan.
When he declared that he was against the EU, he said: “We did not fight world wars to be served.
We must do our own laws in our own country -
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: - The idea that the British people have changed their mind and must remain absolutely not true -
Andrea Jenkyns, Brexitier of Tory, was also present for the demonstration, saying to the journalists: ‘I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
-The Hequers plan is not popular with the general public, the Opposition will not vote for it, not popular with our party and with our activists who are in reality going to the streets and who are first and foremost voting for us.
Please forget the plan of Chequers and start hearing
In a message targeted at Ms May, she said: ‘The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises’
Mr Farage said that politicians should feel under pressure - if they returned from the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
-This is now a matter of trust between us - people - and our political class, - he said.
They are trying to go back from the Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not let you smooth if you do so.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he said: “I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is at the point of returning from the Brexit.
We are mobilizing in the Brexit the army of the people of this country that has brought us success and we will not spend until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud UK -
Meanwhile, those against Brexit moved to Birmingham before they made a two-hour call in the city center.
After the group's launch this weekend, a small number of activists have been driving Banners with writing Tories Against Brexit (Anti-Brexit Tories).
Lord Adonis, who has a high social position in the Labour Party, has set aside the Conservatives for the security issues that they have suffered at the party's disposal as soon as the conference was opened.
This is the case with the people who tell us that they can have all the IT systems in place and technology for Canada and more, for the non-friction border, for free trade without borders in Ireland, he added.
This is a whole farm.
The idea of Brexit well does not exist, he added.

Russia's Grand Prix: Luis Hamilton approaching to get the world title after the orders of his team gave him victory vis-à-vis Sebastian Vetel
On Saturday, from the moment Valteri Bots qualified before Louis Hamilton, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would have an important part in the race.
From the inside position in the first row, Bots had a good advantage and almost abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vetel to attack his partner.
He was the first to enter the stop zones and allowed Hamilton to leave with the others in the last place of the group, something that had to be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in the stop zone after another turn and came out right after Vetel, but Hamilton continued to move after a few bike action with a wheel that led the Ferrara driver to leave the inside free side because of the risk of falling back after a double move to defend in the third corner.
In addition, the Commission considers that the aid granted to VTAN is compatible with the internal market and that the aid is compatible with the internal market and is compatible with the internal market.
It was then in the front of most of the race by not changing its tyres with a view to rapidly completing it and exceeding Kim Rakonen for the fourth place.
He eventually entered the stop zone in 44 turns but could not increase his pace in the eight remaining turns while Rakonen entered the fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valteria did his job very well throughout the weekend and he was a real gentlom said let me by.
The team did a very exceptional job to get the first and second place, - said Hamilton.
That Was Physically Absorbed
President Donald Trump listed Senator Diane Feinstein in the Saturday in connection with her persistence that she did not search for the letter from Christine Blasey Ford who was accusing the nominated person of Supreme Court Brett Kavanagh of sexual assault.
When she spoke in rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly direct the testimony given by Ford before the Senate of the Judicial Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were violent and unswerving -
The only thing that can happen and the wonderful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and violent and unsatisfied, is not sincere, he said.
When you look at statements and disclosures of information and then say no, not I did it.
I didn’t do it. ’
Do You Recall?
Dianne Feinstein, scan some information?
Remember her answer... opened the document -e, e, what is it?
No, you don’t.
I didn't miss anything -
See, wait a minute.
We knew... No, we did not know, - he added, while imitating the Senator.
Feinstein sent her the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanawagh by Ford in July, and it was revealed earlier in September - but Feinstein refused that the disclosure came from her office.
-I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not break her story, - said Feinstein to the committee, reported The Hill.
He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked.
But it seems that her rejection was not well received by the president, who during the Saturday evening's random commented: “You know what I know, that what was really really wrong.
It may be that you did not search, but what is the worst physical injury you've ever seen -
In addition to continuing his defence of the designated person of the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three people, the president suggested that the Democrats were using allegations for their purposes.
-They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see death, disgruntled, they do not care about those who hurt, who make their bicycle sticks to gain power and control, - said the president according to reports from Mediaite.

Air Traffic Supervisor Death to Ensure that People's Mits On Air Plans Can Be Rescued from the Terrestrial
Air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered as a hero after he died to ensure that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people is able to safely land.
More than 800 people died and many were lost after a great earthquake hit the island of Suawesi on Friday, which started a tsunami.
Strong heights continued to rule the area and many are caught in debris in the city of Palu.
However, although his colleagues fled to rescue, the 21-year-old Prophet Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower he was running at the Palu Airport, Mutara Sais Al Jufri Airport.
It remained calm to ensure that Flight 6321 of Batik Air, which at that time was on the route, could leave safely.
He then exceeded the traffic control tower when he thought it was being carried.
He died later in hospital.
The speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision was likely to save hundreds of lives, reported Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately left us this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
When we hear about this, we feel a great sense of relief, as he did.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency says that access to cities of Donggala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
- It is estimated that the number is still increasing because many bodies were still under crushing while many could not be reached, - said the speaker of the Sutopo Purwo Nugro agency.
The waves that reached up to six metres destroyed Paul on Sunday will become dry of the mass.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Cosuma, 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: “Each minute the ambulance is inserted into the body.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being stolen anywhere -
Jan Glfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: -The Red Cross of Indonesia is working cutting to help those still alive but we don't know what to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse -
President of Indonesia Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: “I am asking all of you to work night and day to complete any evacuation tasks.
- report CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Incident of an aircraft in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is lost after the aircraft accident in laguana
The airline operating a flight that took place at the Peace League in Micronesia now states that a man is lost, having previously said that the 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated from the plane that he was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that from Saturday afternoon, she could not give details about where one man was located.
The airline said that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save passengers and other crew members after the aircraft hit the water when they tried to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The officers said that seven of the people were taken to hospital on Friday.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the incident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The U.S. airline and the Navali Fleet have both said that the aircraft in Laguana is a few miles away from the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane exceeded the route.
The American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane came very low.
This is a really good thing, saying Janes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to pass through the water which was high to their superior until the emergency exit on the plane that was sinking.
He said that the flight assistants were screaming and shouting, and that he suffered a small injury in a chair.
The US Navali Fleet said that seafarers working closely to improve the moll also helped to rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport passengers to the shore before the plane was sinking in about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Date from Aviation Safety Network indicates that in the last two decades 111 persons have died in PNG registered airline incidents but no incidents involved Air Niugini.
Analyst presents a life-burning evening schedule
The Saturday prosecution concluded its evidence on the case in the new trial of a man who is accused of burning a woman from Messispsi in 2014 while she was alive.
The Analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlet has been shown for hours as an expert expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described for the jury how he used mobile records to gather together information on the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tallis and the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19-year-old, on the night she died.
Roullet said that he received a localisation data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night that he died, which contradicted his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the phone date showed that he was with Chambers at the time he said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and witnessed that he was not in town at that time.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that that night was in the truck of Sanford, Sanford said that he was--he was lying, since my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Ellis said that he had known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they knew each other only week.
Roullet said that some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
He removed it from his life, saying, \"Hale.\"
The defence is scheduled to start its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the process to pass to the jury later that day.

Another black person?
Nani by NY moves a couple to expel her after a message-racist.
Nay from New York is moving a couple to a discriminatory dismissal after receiving an erroneous message from the mother who was complaining that she was - another black person -
The couple deny that they are racists, and compare the case to an extradition -
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed regret when she learned that the new child-headed person, Giselle Mauritius, was a dark trailer when he arrived for the first working day in 2016.
-LEEEEEEEEEE PERSUNA SWIDEA, wrote Ms Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Ms Morris, twice.
After noting her thick mistake, Plasco-Flaxman felt uncomfortable - and dismissed Ms Maurice, saying that her former African-American grandmother did not do her job well and that instead she was waiting for Philippines, according to New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for her one working day and then sent home in Uber.
Now, Mauice is driving the couple for compensation in respect of dismissal, and is demanding compensation of $350 a day for the six-month live-in position for which she was initially employed, although without a contract.
I want to show them, hearing, you can't do such things, - she told Post Friday, while she added -I know this is discrimination -
The couple attacked the claims that they were racists, saying that Ms. Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable they could do, fearing that they could not trust her after they offered her.
“Martie sent her something that she did not intend to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racist people,’ said Joel Plasco to Post.
But would you trust your child in someone who spoke with a goff, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
And let me ask you, ‘ What is it? ’
When comparing the case to an extradition - Plasco said that only two months had passed since his wife had the baby and was in a very difficult situation.
In what way are you to blame?
It's not nice to do, - added to the investment bank.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly announced to the couple on social media, where she consulted them for their behaviour and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not have related to an ors to talk about
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: -It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who is reading it for the first time before it was published.
The fact that we now know what we know about the great success of Paddington - is truly fun.
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the book of the child from a little game ors, was sure to be optimistic if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication had been very pleasant but had changed a little with grief - after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as a very important family member, - she added that her father was proud of his eventual success although he never would have talked about it.
(He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't full of himself, ” she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child to get something: being proud of them even if it wasn't you that got something.
I think he was looking at the success of Paddington in that way.
Although he was his creation and imagination, he always gave the merit to Paddington’s own -
My daughter was dying and I had to give her last name on the phone.
As soon as her daughter was taken to Nice Louis Pasteur Hospital 2, where doctors worked to save her life but it was all for nothing.
-Nad was calling regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, that he was not expected to live, - said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
- Then I received a call from Nad to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to give her the last smile.
And I did.
I told her,-Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicines prescribed by the doctors to keep her heart beat were decreasing and leaving her system slow.
She had died some of the time before and started to cross everything.
All I could do was sit down and wait, aware that all this is happening.
I couldn't shout or shout or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I should have kept my word. ’
In the end, Ms Ednan-Laperouse, who was so far crying for her daughter's loss, came on board along with the other passengers - who did not know the difficult situation she was experiencing.
No one knew, she said.
-I had a low head, and tears began to fall all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but there was on the flight that I felt a great sense of sympathy towards Nad.
That he needed my love and that we were killed.
I knew how much he loved her.
Place of distressed women's cards to avoid suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost someone dear to suicide are working to prevent others from taking off their hands.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were placing cards on Welsh bridge with inspiration messages and telephone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Ms Davis, was 13 years old when he started to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day, but she said it.
Ms Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew for his smile.
They always said that his smile was lit every room -
However, he had to stop working before he died, because he was in a very dark place -
In 2014, a Tyler brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had killed himself.
Ms Davis said: “I always fear that this will be the cause of another bad event -
Ms Davis created the cards, in order to inform people that there are people with whom you can open your heart or meet, even as a friend.
Do not sit in silence - there is a need to speak -
Ms Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms. Davis for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not much after his mother's death.
He wouldn't say that he was feeling badly or depressed or so, and she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day it was very bad - when the children opened up their gifts with no contact with them with his eyes or something -
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they wanted to fight her:
Do you want to save us?
But all of us must continue with our life and fight ’

The FBI will initiate an investigation on the basis of the information provided by the FBI.
- I said, that if we could get something like what he requested - an investigation limited in time, limited in purpose - we might have brought some unity, - said Mr. Fleke on Saturday, while saying that fear that the committee was inferred - among the partner factions that raised the roots.
Why did Mr Kavanawagh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their withdrawal is fully due for the choice of time.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November - if, as expected, the Republicans do not go well, in that case they will be severely weakened in their attempts to put the man they want to be elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was taking the phone to call the Senators, to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanawagh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through which he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, where they currently hold 51 Republics and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, Vice-President, to vote and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea - under Kim
The number of North Korean deserters for South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, said South Korea legislator.
When quoting data from the Ministry for the Union of the South, Park Byeong-seug, said that last year there were 1,127 party changes - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates requesting human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters are automatically offered South Korean citizenship.
Seeul states that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most of them escape by passing through China, which has the longest North Korean border and is easier to share compared to the highly protected Militaryised Zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often send them back to their country by force.
North-South - technically still in war - relations have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stagnating of denuclearisation negotiations.
This followed the June historic meeting between United States President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards the Korean nuclear-risk-free peninsula.
But Saturday, North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Young-ho has put in place United States sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
(a) Without trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, in no way will we be the first to remove weapons unilaterally, - Mr Ri in speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bret Kavanahgh-steric, - saying that he is not able to work at the Supreme Court
The minority leaders of the Nancy Pellos Chamber called on the person nominated to the Supreme Court Mr. Bett Kavanawagh-steric - and said that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because of his temporary behaviour.
Felosi made these comments at a meeting on the Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in August, Texas.
I could not think of the fact that if a woman would ever behave in that way, they would say -sterical, - said Paulosi about her reaction to Kavanawagh's witness before the Judicial Committee of the Senate on Thursday.
Kavanawagh emotionally rejected the allegations that he was sexually abused by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were young.
During his opening statement, Kavanawagh was very emotional, sometimes he was even crying and weeping when he was talking about his family and his secondary school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats to the committee, calling for allegations against him-assignment of the grotsika and coordinated character - organised by the liberals who are angry that Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pellosi said that she believed that the Kavanawagh witness proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he had prejudices against Democrats.
I think he qualifies himself by those declarations and the way in which he went after the Clintons and the Democrats, she said.
Pelosis moved when a question was asked whether she would try to accuse Kavanawagh if confirmed, and if the Democrats would obtain a majority in the Chamber of Representatives.
I'm going to say something -- if he's not telling the Congress or the FBI, so he's not capable, not only of being at the Supreme Court, but even being in the court that is currently in it, - said Pilos.
Currently Kavanawagh is a judge at the Court of Appeal of D.C.
Paulosi added that as Demokrat she was concerned about the potential decisions of Kavanagh against Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he is considered to be conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanawagh avoided questions as to whether he would change certain Supreme Court decisions.
It is not appropriate for a person with a hysteric prejudice to go to court and wait to say, \"very good\", said Pilos.
And Women Exercise Their Authority.
It is a fair verbal attack, months and years filled with anger, and she cannot say what she should say without crying.
We weep when we grow up, - she told me the rich Steinem 45 years later.
I don't think this is a rare thing, what does it say? ’
She added, “I am grateful to a woman who was reached elsewhere, who said that even she was crying when she was raised, but developed a technique that meant that when she was raising and starting to cry, she would tell the person she was talking to, “You’re probably thinking that she’s sad because I’m crying.
I’m raised -
And then he did not stop.
And I thought it was something brilliant -
The crying is allowed as a way to release his great anger partly because they are fundamentally interpreted incorrectly.
One of my most clear memories of one of the first jobs I had, in an office dominated by men, where one of them once found myself crying undetected anger, was when an older woman led me from the neck thigh - a cool manager who was always afraid of some of it - and carried me to the stairs.
You never let them see you cry, ” she told me.
They do not know that you are raised up.
They think that you are sad and happy to have been able to hurt you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Democratic Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was going out for the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in a relationship outside the marriage on a boat known as Monkey Business and emerged from the election, Ms Schroeder concluded that there was no reason why she did not explore the idea of leaving herself for the presidential election.
This was not a well-planned decision, - she said to me 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates who were going out for the election, and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called it - White Snow and Seven Nani -
As this was at the end of the campaign, she was returning to the collection of funds, so she decided that she would not come out for the election if she did not make $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who were giving $1,000 to the men to her were giving her only $250.
Do you think I'm getting some discount?
When she made her speech, she announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, so emotional - gratefully to the people who supported it, raised it with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters instead of delegates, and raised it to gender - that it got up.
- I thought I had these strong brakes, - she reminded Ms Schroeder of the way the media responded to her.
- I was thinking that Kelenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will you write on my grave?

How the US-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The numbers of air bombs opening the United States-China trade war would crush you, and while the battle remains to end, a lack of understanding between countries could benefit Beijing in the long term, say experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, gave the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exporters including solar panels, iron and aluminium.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting goods amounting to $200 billion ($150 billion), and effectively taxing all goods entering the USA from China.
Beijing has been remunerated each time in the same way, while more recently it has been presenting five to ten percent tariffs on $60 billion of US goods.
China has promised to agree with the US each time, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will surrender in the near future.
The fact that Washington takes a step backward means that it accepts requests, but publicly the fact that China surrenders to the US will be too embarrassing for X Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say that if Beijing works carefully, the pressures of the US trade war could positively support China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions to start an economic chaos in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what the viewers previously acknowledged, said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia at the Centre for New American Security, which is a reflection group.
Syria is ready - to return refugees, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
When speaking to the General Assembly of Unity Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moalem said that conditions in the country are improving.
The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government is continuing to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees in the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and living.
The UN estimates that since the start of the war in 2011 more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moalem said that the Syrian regime welcomes assistance to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the kingdom.
Europe embraces the victory of Ryder Cup in Paris

Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergeio Garcia became the best European toll player ever here with 25.5 points throughout his career.
It is usually not easy to cry, but today I can’t keep up.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed me.
I am very happy, very pleased to get back the cup.
The team is all, and I am glad that I could help, - said Garcia emotionalized after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his partner John Ram who won to the golf legend of the United States Towers 2 & 1 in singles play on Sunday.
The incredible pride that I feel, that I won Tiger Woods, when I grew up to follow him, said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all of his four games in France and now has a record of Ryder Cup 13-21-3 throughout his career.
Strange statistics of one of the best players ever here, who won 14 key titles, only second after Jack Nicklaus.
Tim USA struggling to find those parts of the golf track with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high caliber golf throughout the whole tone.
The US master Jim Furyk spoke after disappointing performance for his team, -I am proud of these men, they fight.
There was a time this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We've hung up.
To Thomas we drop the hat.
He is a very good master.
His 12 players played very well.
We will join again, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
To these 12 young men I love and I am proud that I am a master.
You have to catch the hat and play your head.
Play better than it’
