The evidence, or the ability to see, depends on the sensitivity of the visual system or the eyes.
There are many structures of eyes that change at their complex level according to the requirements of the organism.
The different structures have different capabilities, different wave patterns and different degrees of gravity, as well as different processing requirements to interpret the recording and different numbers to work best.
