Appreciate the situation perfectly.
You were a great crowd.
Consign!
Get trapped, surrender!
You're trapped.
You're being bullied.
You were very good to me.
You were so good to me.
You were so good to me.
You were very quiet.
You convinced me.
You've got a little heat today, right?
You must raise your voice.
You were shot.
You found the right enemy.
You win!
Wait, thank you!
You wanted to tell me about freedom?
You want a beating?
You want to watch a French movie, don't you?
You considered 70 kilos.
You'll be advised.
Focus.
You were mine.
You were my life.
You've never been like him.
You're not being questioned today, are you?
You weren't jealous.
You didn't buy.
You were happy to prove that this trial was deleted, right?
They told you to let go.
You were Tom's only friend.
Be a good diplomat.
You won't even know I'm there.
You'll be talking to such a paralytic man in vain.
You won't be there in time.
You won't tell them, will you?
You won.
You guys won.
You won?
Would you do that for me?
You'll never understand.
You don't know what you're talking about yourself.
My day will use this camera tomorrow afternoon.
