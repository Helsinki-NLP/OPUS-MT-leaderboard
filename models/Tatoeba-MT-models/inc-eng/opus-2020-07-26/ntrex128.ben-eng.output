Wells Ambli members are concerned about their own self-assuming as ‘mapes’
Among a number of assembly members, there are fear of changing their title MWP (the Olsh Park) into a number of members.
This terror is due to changing the name of Assamli and proposed to the Wesh Park.
Members of various political parties are afraid to face the names of the different political parties.
One of the Lebanese Associations said that his group was concerned that "with the Twp and PP of the new term"
To the outside readers of Wells: Olish, Twp means stupid and pup.
As a podcast member, they have suggested that as a group, as a group they are not “not unique” and a choice.
One member of the Wells Conscientious Party says that the group is “seeing the difference between MWP and size.”
In this sense, the English language of Weschew is like the English language.
Ambli commission, which provides the order for the change to begin, said: "The final decision of the members of the Assembly will be to make the details of what will happen."
The Governor of Wells, Oct.17 gave Elish the right to change their name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public agreement that has been a lot of support to change the name of Assamli and support for the Welsh Parliament.
Concerning members of the Assembly members, the commission is supporting the Wellsal Parliamentum, or WMMP, but MWP has increased support for the public.
In light of this, members of the Assembly would recommend different options, but it would be difficult to reach out for Angel Jones, the Society's office.
This system will have different changes in assembly activities, including the ability and development of members of the Assembly members of the Assembly Committee.
After the debate on this law, the Ambly members will receive the final votes on what should be their votes.

Traffic assembly in West Virginia
During the middle elections, the president strongly mentioned the situation around Brett Canana, the president of his Supreme Court.
"All that we have done is in November.
Five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
It's a big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm actually running because I'm running all over the places to fight the oppressed, and he said,
The trip continued, "You've seen these terrible, terrible chemical groups, you've seen it happening now.
And you're looking for this, and they need to use any means to get back to power.
They're hitting the dogs, their power and control, they don't give up everything they want, they don't just want power and control, we don't give them it.
He says that the DMCTs are on the mission to "operate and Resistance" mission.
"And you've seen that for the last four days," he says, "the Decocatts have been called "retriets and naughty" and "disgusting".
He called Dan Festin, the Chief Committee of the Citizen’s Legal Committee, the Democratic Citizen, who received high tickets from audiences.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you break the team?
Ah, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting-- it's the truth that's the worst man I've ever seen."
Labar is no free organization.
Those who remember what's in their mouth are not allowed to endure here.
When the members of the party in my area accused me of being voted, it wasn't surprising.
Because you don't have to be welcomed by Bolla's sense of humor here-- I was the last LP to tell you this.
My Parliamentary colleague Juan Ranny found the same way because he stood firm against Jewish-corruption.
In my case, I was accused of arguing with Jameribine.
Regarding the importance of a responsible economic policy, Europe and national security, and similar issues on which Jamremie didn't agree with the former leaders.
On Friday evening, the notice said that we want to include and build meetings on Friday.
In my eight years as a local LP, this is exactly what happened on Friday.
Sadly, today, it is not the nature of the meeting and the promise of "the Great, Great" politics that has been forgotten if it has ever started.
It has been widely acknowledged that the Lebanese party is not to tolerate differences and that each opinion is justified on whether it is acceptable for the group leadership.
Soon after the German leader, I thought I had the same political outlook with the colleagues that I thought they started looking for me and asked me to take a position that I didn't agree to be a national security or the IO unit.
When I speak in public - and whatever I say - it doesn't matter - it's been called by social media to remove me, the center's politics is condemned, and I'm told that I shouldn't be at the party.
And it's not just my own experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that follow me also become political.
I'm surprised to see all the workers who face the storm of discrimination or racial oppression each day, but never get ashamed of their career and plans.
In this era of politics, how has Galagolili’s lowness become a reality?
Zeremobin claimed that the Liberia Party should develop a culture of tolerance last week.
The reality is that we are not no longer free organization and each allows the change of votes or election policy.
For the past two years, I've been urging many to keep my head down so that I don't be so lazy and that I'm right.
But I'm not in politics to do this.
When I joined the school as a school student in Labar 32 years ago, we were assigned to Moscow by the government's ashes that destroyed our extensive school classes in a literal sense, and I tried to give the necessary public service, whether it was the local Council's minister.
I never hid my politics with the last election.
No one has been confused about my policy and the ways of conflict with the current leadership.
For those who preached the movement on Friday, I would only say that when the country is moving towards a market that would destroy families, businesses, and our peoples, I can't feel loyal to the leaders of Lebar's Party.
However, I don't really have a message for Nathanahmum, it's not for my elections, it's not to my voters, it's either a member or a member: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threat or political right to you will prevent me from doing what I do.

The memory of the island remains clear to Chile in the middle of Bolivia’s country, in the middle of the 19th century to a bloodthirsty-like conflict between Chile and Chile – just as the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes may be greater in the decades since Bolivia has discussed five years after the discussion of the International Court on October 1.

"We're very close to the Pacific Ocean," he promised to the end of August.
However, some scholars believe that the court cannot decide for Bolivia - and if that happens, it will be short.
The Netherlands-based U.S. organization does not have the power to block Chile and report that they will not determine the results of possible discussions.
The verdict that only six months after the final arguments came, suggests that the case was not "not a military", as a senior citizen of the Chile International Law.

John Edward: Language skills are needed for global citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have kept a track record of the Academic civilization, and it has continued with the results of another undisclosed test in 2018, which is strengthened by personal and mutual success in the efforts of art, art, music, music, and other communities.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, the school has tried to put their students and parents in the best position.
For their students more and higher education, their choice is to prepare for their place as a professional and global citizen.
As a educational field that can be designed and applied in a special school, we see modern languages continue as popular and popular in schools.
Nelson Mandela says: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes on to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, he's in his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that if we want to build relationships and trust in other countries, we can't just rely on English.
From the results of this year's recent investigation, we see that the languages are the top of the League table with the highest level of the population in the private school.
Among foreign students who are studying foreign languages have the total 68% of the highest grade.
From the school of the 47 members of the SCISS, 72 percent of students have gained high grade in Madrid when 72 percent of the university studies, 69 percent of the French study and 63 percent of Spanish studies.
It is proof that foreign languages in Scotland support foreign schools as an effective tool for children and young people in the future must be required in the future.
The language is now popular, as well as the education of independent schools and other Islamic topics (such as science, technology, engineering and democracy) and democracy.
In 2014, U.S. commissioner for Amplification and Scullys showed that the organizers were responsible for their ability to cope with the absence of their language skills.
So more than that, language skills have become essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are needed in the world for more potential opportunities.
Anyone who chooses a Kenyan language, if they learn another language, will have the real benefit of having their lifetime skills in the future.
Before being able to communicate directly with foreigners, a prominent person has been competition.
According to the 2013 survey, 75 percent of adults in Ukraine could not speak well in any foreign language during the conversation, and French languages were the only percent of the languages in the country, 15 percent.
This is why investing language education is important for children today.
More languages, especially developing economy, give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, each school must be divided into languages to teach them.
A number of schools will focus on other schools in modern languages, while watching over 2020, others will teach the language that is most important to Ukraine, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest is, there will always be many languages to choose in private schools, including experts.
Scots are concerned to provide a education environment that will prepare children and prepare them with the necessary skill to succeed in the future.
This is not to be denied at this time in the global market environment that languages play a vital role in the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be viewed as “a skill of international communication.”
The schools will provide the love, diversity and excitement for the youth in Scotland.
You must be a single one.

Herverd's students are taking enough rest.
This year, a new course of studies at Harvard University is making it easier for all his students to sleep more for the growing culture of reading at night."
One scholar discovered that a number of students of the world’s university students are often confused about how to care for themselves.
The course of studies conducted by Professor and Briggam and woman Hospital at Harvard Medical School has developed this course, which believes that it is the first place in the United States.
After giving a talk about what had affected the lack of sleep education he received, he received an inspiration to start the course.
‘ At the end of the day, a girl came to me and said: ‘ Why did I say it was so long ago that my senior did come in? ’
He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - who surprised me, "He told the telegraph."
As the first year of the year, the course of the course of this course has helped students to get a good sleep at the Academy and Attica Parkmans and explained the need to improve their normal health.
Paul Barra, director of the medical school at Harvard Medical School and the University’s Health Services Department, said that students decided to start the university after a serious fall in the week.
There's a long course in the course of a course of course.
In a section, students will have a photograph of a student’s clothes, screen, education, and the effects of the cancer and lighting, and the importance of a degree of sleep and the importance of a degree of education.

He says the culture of pride still exists, adding that the lack of sleep on modern technology and students is an ongoing problem.
A student who is sure to sleep with good values should be a ‘white weapon’ to fight for fatigue and anxiety, and he says he even makes the sleeping brain go unexplained.
In California, 19-year-old Ramnd So, professor, helped develop a class at Harvard's first birthday.
He said that the course opened his eyes and made him jealous for a camp-wide course.
In the next step, he hopes that all students of the students will ask to complete a study program before joining the competition.
Professor Szier recommended that students should consider when they should go to bed and when they should be awake and be aware of the impact of the damage of the electromagnetic screen and Eledo Alo Alo, which can lead to the death of your seniors, causing them to sleep.

In any new image with British talent, it is now traditional and it seems to have been applied to the production of the public English Action-Camed Sophanism - which began in 2003, and came back to England in 2011.
Clearly, how many trash communities we're going to be going to have a new chance of rehabilitation?
Whatever rate, pop-ups, unable to create new things for public English is the second time that his name indicates that he's designed for the world of other languages without English.
He must have shared a note of the Olympics of the Olympics of the Olympics in London in 2012, despite the lack of safari Zachmakum.
He was primarily based on the trailer and the people of international mystery at Atkkinson once had forgotten the Barclay TV advertisements.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Casitaric has been seriously involved in the magic of Kabul, who claimed that he could solve the problems of British computers: Jack Lasse Jellalta.
English and Babu started the strange words of their famous high-jesan: they set a fire in a frayed fashion in the streets; they beat Voltsalsululate themselves into the Bisulululous boat; and they tried to make themselves known to the Italian home.

The number of North Korean gangs is "cracked" under the keys.
After Kim Jong-un had been in power seven years ago, the group of North Koreans was reduced to a ruling law in South Korean.
Park Big-Seg, South Korea's Ministry of Association, quoted the report, saying that last year the group had 1,127 - which was in 2011.
According to Mr Park, the main cause is the control of strict limits between North Korea and China and human trafficking.
Pyyteyeyeong didn't comment on it.
A number of groups from North Korea have been allowed to be a citizen of South Korean.
Soul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have passed out illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the Chinese have fled to China, with a long border with North Korea, and it is easier than it could be to be the most vulnerable army in two Koreans.

Kwanf, who refused to report, said that he had sex with Dr. Kristin Blazi when both of them were young.
During his initial statement, Kanvinf was deeply interested in talking about his family and high school life.
He clearly condemned the democrats at the committee and allegedly accused him of being a “virtual and committed character in Libya,” alleged that it was from Harog of the 2016 presidential election.
Paulos says he believes that Kavanif's testimony is not worthy of the Supreme Court because it proves that he's a rival against the DMOC.
"I think he made the statement he gave and the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats," he said.
When she was asked if Kanvanoff was sure that the Democratic People's House and if he's in charge, he would curse her.
"I'll tell you that if he doesn't really tell the Congress or FI, he's not just the Supreme Court, but he's also in the court."
Kwanf is currently a judge of the DC court of the People's Court of Applis.
Pelosy adds that as a decomotive, he is concerned that Kavananf Afrard will oppose him for the latter, since he himself is a Confucistive jesus.

I'm really angry."

Patrick Shirder, then from Colorado, was working with him at the Democratic Congressman, Gary Hart's presidential election.
When Mr. Hart was caught up in a foreign boat on a foreign boat about marriage in 1987, a deep disappointment led to the absence of his own president, Mr. Bine Business, who was deeply disappointed that there was no reason to be a candidate of his own president.
"It wasn't a very interesting decision," he said in laughter after 30 years.

China's decision to fight with its eyes, and the second largest of the world's greatest economy is not at all possible.
In public, the state of Washington would be very insulting to China’s president Zininginging, China's president, Jipinginging out his head to the United States.
