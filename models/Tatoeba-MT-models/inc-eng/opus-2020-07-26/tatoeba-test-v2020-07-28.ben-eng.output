He's walking.
What does this mark mean?
The letter was written.
Stop here.
Tom saw you.
Come with me.
No, thank you.
Wait here.
Am I too late?
Leave him.
I can't be right.
Language is a medium of communication.
Tom knows that.
I've never heard Tom.
What time is the next train for Tokyo?
Tom is taking a big risk.
Are they yours?
What are you talking about?
I'll work.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You're rich.
Will you go to America next month?
I don't want to swim.
I'm not the owner.
Thank you very much.
He hasn't come yet.
I'm sorry!
I want to tell you how much I want to tell you.
The snow reflects the sluggards.
Come out.
They screamed.
I ran home.
We made pancakes for the night.
You don't have a bicycle?
I don't know if he's coming.
You're shouting.
He's Skylene.
He doesn't want to talk about this.
Everyone saw it.
I'll give my cat a lunch in the morning and in the morning.
My son came home.
I'm a student.
I'll be there.
Do you have your passport?
Please fix my words.
Do what he says.
I'm tired of seeing you.
Tom started shouting.
Sit there.
I wasn't alone.
I've learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom always keeps his word.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We saw them.
June 18th and today's birthday.
Who won?
Let's get ready.
We just have to let Tom do this to us, right?
Can I get these pieces in a state of security?
I'm going to Osaka station.
I don't think Tom is responsible for this.
Someone's in Kashlo.
I went to the barracks.
I learned to live without him.
My father is very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Let's wait a minute.
Tom was very busy with work.
I'm not proud of the way I used to.
I kissed you.
We'll work.
He came.
I don't agree with him.
Come to me.
I'm trying.
My hands are not working properly.
Forget Tom.
What courage!
Is it Tom's book?
He was angry.
Who are you?
I could have died.
Are you sure?
Now we have to go.
He ignores his education.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
They eat healthy food.
My mother loves music.
He's gonna burn his head easily.
Wherever he goes, his dog is behind him.
Who is this?
Can I work here?
There's a problem.
It's my boss to collect the old bottles.
I like the painting.
I don't want to go.
When will the next bus leave?
What does that mean?
Don't you have a bicycle?
Do you want to come?
My mother could play very good golf.
He knows where we are.
I know your name.
Tom's not here now.
What did you say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom stopped shouting.
How old is Tom?
Come on, Assie!
Stop kissing.
Is Tom there?
I shed blood in noon.
My back is still suffering.
Where's Tom?
They seem to be American.
You were the only friend to Tom.
I went to the hospital.
I accepted his invitation.
My father can drive a very good car.
I'll be alone.
You need a friend.
Forget about Tom.
I think Tom said his position was Jackson.
You knew Tom for a long time.
I know.
I'm playing football now.
My wallet hasn't reached yet.
Tom hasn't come here yet.
Please wait until he comes.
Tom keeps his word very little.
Eat something.
Is there someone at home?
What are you doing?
I think Tom's good.
Where am I going to get from?
I'm going to bite.
Can he speak French?
Tom might want to take it.
We love our country.
Is he a doctor?
A little more?
And one day he left.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friend.
Stop that woman.
How old is that church?
Ask me tomorrow.
It's still mine.
Where am I supposed to claim my wallet?
We do whatever we want.
Tom is right.
I ran to my mother.
This book is not for the students who are not Japanese.
Tom wanted to be a minister.
Who would you believe?
He's a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I wanted.
No one is necessary.
Are you here?
The rest were laughing.
How many nights do you have?
Have you seen the man in this photo?
I lost my wallet.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want to wake Tom.
My son's got money.
The sky looks like the snow starts tonight.
How much is it worth?
You know what Tom wants.
We'll dance.
I can't stop Kashi.
I want Tom to be happy.
Those who live in the mud shouldn't be rocked.
Why are you shouting?
Stop Tom.
I think I should go to the hospital.
Tom wants his roof back.
Is Tom at home?
Tom always keeps his word.
I'm dancing.
I'm your friend.
How long have you been?
Who's here?
The city is divided into a river and west.
Come see you.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I have to go to bed.
Do you have a car?
Tom is playing the guitar.
Do you have any idea what to do now?
He's missing right now.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
You should ask him for advice.
This tooth hurts.
How much do they do?
How much to pay for extra flour?
Everyone liked Tom.
What happened here?
Here's your key.
Are you Japanese?
Let's wait a minute.
Eat whatever you like.
Take this.
Have you ever broken your bones?
He was angry.
We learned English.
I couldn't move my right leg.
I'm dry.
How old are you?
Can I ask you a question?
What is that?
Here's your key.
We've seen more bad things.
Help Tom.
I'm almost sure.
What's that?
He's eating.
Cherrapunji likes.
You don't understand.
My mother is suffering.
Sit at the table.
She's younger than me.
What's your name?
We were waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
Can I use credit card?
It's too big, isn't it?
This book is available only in French.
Tell me.
I'll take him.
Can I buy you a credit card?
Tom found my bike.
I went home to Jackson's house.
He was wearing a black hat.
Anything else?
Everybody squeezing.
Is there any excuse for students?
I eat noodles.
Tom's in the house.
Don't ask me what they're doing.
Will you come in?
That's it.
We like football.
Will you eat?
Good evening.
He's empty fruit.
I want a new suit for these shoes.
Everyone liked Tom.
Who's that?
I'm still your friend.
Have fun.
Please listen!
He's running.
It's rain tomorrow, but I'm going to go to bed.
I'm hurting my right shoulder.
My father was busy.
Everyone's ready to go.
I couldn't catch that train at 7:00 a.m.
He had two daughters.
This is my wife.
Let's talk.
Do you have a pen?
The class doesn't start every eight seconds.
How much time do you spend in that?
What does that word mean?
How much do I get?
Can you say English?
What they did was wrong.
My son is long from me.
Tom's parents were also a singer.
Here you go.
Tom's alive.
He looks at the factory.
Answer me.
This bag is mine.
Tom was angry.
How much is it worth?
You can eat whatever you want.
Let go.
I'm a little hot.
Can you speak French?
He's a doctor.
Fill it up.
How old are you?
Get Tom.
They're laughing.
You're shouting.
I don't think tomorrow will rain.
I'll be back when I finish.
I like light.
He's grown up in France.
He didn't work on Sunday night.
He taught me to write.
Happy birthday!
It's not your book, it's mine.
The tyres have been killed.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
Tom's father is a pig.
Listen.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
It's time.
I never make mistakes.
Where's the high door on UA11?
I'm fucking.
Why are you staring at me?
Tom wants his roof back.
Which time do you usually go to sleep?
The country has a deal of agreement between themselves.
I'll talk to Tom. Just French.
Tough eyes.
Can you put this on a little puppy?
Tom's in the garage now.
What did you forget?
I don't really want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He laughs.
He hasn't come yet.
It's not mine.
Who came?
He's eating the fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
The terrorists left the prisoners.
I could go with you, but I didn't have time.
I lost my wallet.
He's a good man.
We did it.
The government has made a move.
Get out of town!
Guin until Tish.
He's eating.
How old is that church?
Let's go!
It's Japanese.
Did you see him go away?
Where's the bus for the airport?
Don't fight.
That's my cat.
That bag is mine.
I have an old computer that I don't need anymore.
I've got a fight.
We were walking on foot.
I want this.
I need those papers.
Tom screamed.
Tom laughs very little.
Eat what you want.
Tom is crying.
How much is it worth?
I'm fine.
They're a doctor.
The plane's got the right time.
I don't know what you mean.
Most of the audience were businessmen.
Turn right.
Tom's probably sleeping.
I've got a lot of shit.
Tom has won a lot of running.
He knows where we live.
I learned a lot from Tom.
Tom's messed up.
Everyone was shouting.
I'll stay out.
My mother can cook well.
They're crying.
The research was successful.
I think there's little chance to keep the gold found to him.
Boston is a big city.
I'm 17.
Here you go.
Let's talk to Tom.
Eat your milk.
The name of both of us is Tom.
They were all happy.
Is this your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who broke the flowers?
Tom's hurt.
Go back to Tom's pan.
Is Tom still angry with me?
Tom's stuck.
We were waiting for you.
I'm not perfect.
Do you know what he said?
Listen to me.
We made a lot of mistakes.
Why are you shouting?
What's your father's name?
Look over there.
Let me know if I have to do something.
We tried.
Tom resigned in October.
The market's next to the doctor.
Happy Canda Day!
I'll be late.
What does this mark mean?
Tom got his head down.
Are we ready?
I like Tom's blue Anas.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen carefully.
Would you like to go buy me a shop?
Take it easy.
They're there.
I'll bite.
Everyone's busy.
Don't let me down.
Who was it?
I'm Lazuq.
When I said that Mary left the city, I was really surprised to see Tom left.
I heard a scream.
What time is your plane?
I don't want to talk about this.
I thought my book was interesting.
Tell me what happened.
I've been up for 8:00 today.
Please burn the light.
Tom's hurt.
I'm still your friend.
It took me more than two hours to translate English.
Are they yours?
Who is he?
Is this the little way to get to the station?
Tom tried to kill Mary.
What do you know about him?
It's impossible!
How long does the train reach Yakoma?
What time is it?
The words that don't correct them are not correct, but you can add more common translations instead.
Your shoes are here.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
Has anyone left any news for me?
I want to cook for you.
Listen to me, does this train reach Washington Square?
We failed.
There's Essie in this house.
Did you wear the whole thing?
Tom Boston was playing.
Say it clearly.
Don't open it.
Tom saw him.
The evening snow can melt.
I'm not proud of him.
Is there someone there?
It's wrong.
I'm no longer young.
He's eating.
It's just blood.
Would you like to catch us with the fish?
Just wait here.
I'll be back in a minute.
Just a minute.
Tom got hurt.
Mary explained.
I'm not rejecting it.
Don't see!
End it as soon as possible.
Use it.
How long does the train reach Yakoma?
I don't understand that either.
I've got seven times this morning.
I'm at home.
Take it easy.
Happy Christmas!
I'm in.
Me too.
I'm not too busy.
It's amazing.
Do it again!
Tom started in the sky.
They're kids.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why don't you go?" "Well I don't want to go."
I know it.
I'll be close.
Call me tomorrow.
Tell me what you want.
I'm hurting my legs.
Ask Tom.
I'm thinking about what I'll give you in birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
Nice to see you again.
Why are you shouting?
Stay right there.
Eat the food you like.
We played the park.
I'm busy.
Where can I buy tickets?
I've finished my job.
I'm planning to stay at the hotel.
I finally got my keys.
Tom started shouting.
I'm not arguing.
Can you read?
How old is your father?
Are you okay?
I've never seen Tom happy from it.
Don't get in there.
We're lost.
Tom's laughing.
We can still do that.
I tried.
I'm sick.
I'm empty. Thank you.
Unfortunately it's true.
We were waiting for them.
How old do you think to see me?
Tom's not happy here.
It was angry.
I don't like coffee.
Speak more slowly.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to meet Tom?
Here you go.
We don't care what he does.
I called my best friend Tom.
We'll never play better than it.
We're Lazuq.
The bill will be released today.
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know that it's not right.
Eat what you like.
I have wine.
Why did Tom cry?
