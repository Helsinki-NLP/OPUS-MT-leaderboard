John Edward: Language School for Global Citizens
There is a record of the independent school in Scotland, education performance, sports, art, music, and other outstanding results of the final results of the 20th year of 2018.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, the school is trying to provide a higher level of service to their students and their parents.
The independent school has already begun to prepare its students for higher and higher education as well as for the purpose of preparing their favorite careers and global citizen citizens.
We see modern languages as a subject that is most popular in school as a set of schools.
Nelson Mandela says: “If you speak in a language that you can understand, what you say is going on in his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it's in his heart."
We know that we cannot depend on English when we need to maintain relationships and trust in other countries.
In recent years, the results of recent research have shown that the average number of languages in the world has risen at the highest level in the world’s schools.
A 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages have received that number.
The data collected from SCISA by the students at school 74 percent revealed that 72 percent of the students received an additional number of English, 72 percent of Germans, and 69 percent of French languages.
These show that the high school schools in Scotland provide support for children and young people in the future.
The STM issues of the University of STM (VM, technology, engineering, and mathematics) have been observed in schools and in other places as well as in other places.
In 2014, a survey of the Ministry of Health and the Association of Health in the United States revealed that 17 percent of the patients ’ efforts to fill the needs of the patients were involved in the use of the language.
So young people need language skills to prepare for their future careers.
These skills are necessary in the global world with increased ability to speak ability.
Whatever the case, if someone is raised in a second language, such life will be very rewarding.
The majority of people in foreign countries will be able to communicate directly with the people.
In an interview with adults in the United Kingdom, a survey of 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013 saw that 75 percent of the population could not speak a foreign language, and 15 percent spoke French.
It is important that parents teach their children language.
In developing countries, there will be a greater opportunity for children to find suitable jobs in a variety of languages.
In Scotland, the language is different from the school class.
More than a number of schools have been focused on foreign languages, and other schools, such as Mandelin and Japan by 2020, will be taught in the United States as important to the United Kingdom by 2020.
Your child’s desires may be limited to what he can choose in public and will be useful to teachers who are involved in teaching it.
Steel is dedicated to producing an environment that requires training for children to prepare for the future and to perfect the needs of their children.
This needs to be seen in education, since a global business community cannot be denied the importance of the language for the future.
Of course, modern languages should be considered "Jao or international communication skills".
The independent school's choice, variety and excellence will lead to a young king of Scotland.
It must be done.
John Edward is the director of the Scotland Council for a public school.

In the United States, the athlete played a five - story game instead of playing a soccer game in the United States, eager to impress him with the reason for his suffering.
Although he was at the top of his game, this 48-year-old athlete was not a good master to attack directly.
If this road doesn't follow him so much, on Sunday's New Year's New Year, Milcson B will meet with François Molinai and face the face. He has joined the team to win four games in this week.
Mecalson's game will be very decisive to give the Americans a warm start from 12 to four points below.
Führer’s confidence in this man was not because he had to do something else.
"He's fully aware of the work today, he's locked up my back and said he'll be ready tomorrow," said Farik.
"He's strong enough to believe in him.
He was a good player in the past and has done much for the team this week.
I didn't see he played two games.
I expected more than that, but we thought that this was what we should do.
He wanted to be there, like everyone else."
Michaelson's record will be broken down by the more than a hundred Rydor cells.
This may have been the last chance to play in his single story.

The European Leader Thomas Borgan, the final day of the release of the Radder Council, is aware that these points have been pushed into the gap in the final phase of the contest until the end of the day.

Friday and yesterday's 2018 team was watching the five-three points of 5-6 in Valdramam yesterday, and we had a big gap in Brooklyn, but we broke in Brooklyn, and we won't win the day in Valdrama," which was very small.
So it will be to me and to all those who are in this group.
You'll be in full water tomorrow.
Go ahead and do the best you can.
This is not the last time you've marked your score.
Our goal is to win this verse and to keep it in its place.
As from the beginning, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side but on the other side-- we know that the best players in the world are the players."
Happy to see how hard-playing the game was, Borgan said: “I could not have done this on my own.
Tomorrow is a very different challenge.
The day will come when you will have a change of mind.
It's a pleasure to be with a partner when everything is well done but when you're alone you'll be able to check your skills as a golf Player.
That's the message you need to carry to the players tomorrow.
Now, let your partner come in your footsteps and he will act with his best.'

Führer, a member of the British team who played the last day of the match, before he was removed from Europe.
In 1999 when leader Ben Renshaw heard how his deaths occurred to the last day, he said, "I remember all the words," he answered.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you've seen in Brooklyn, you'd like to get to the beginning of that fast.
In one direction, it makes a huge pressure to compete with the middle of the race.
We're going to set up our pre-school and we're going to set up a game that we feel we're going to meet, as you know, we're trying to do something tomorrow's miracle."
The goal of facing the face of other Europeans, Rori Michael McCoy, and other Europeans at the top of the game is to lead the fight.
"I went forward with this order because I thought it would cover everything I thought was about the selection of Bronx.
The New Year’s War — A Turning Point in Germany
The local press reports that instead of the old warship of the German Navy, the new ship was to be joined in 2014, at least because of the lack of damage that has been experienced by the wrong systems and hundreds of millions of tigers during the next year.
The New Bedden-Verginberg's chief ship "Rainland-Falls" is now running down to the first half of the 20th year of 2019.
The boat was to be joined by the Navy in 2014, and there was a great shock at the end of the project.
In 2007 the Navy was ordered by the Navy to go to Bendan-Vurbert, four old Bremansmans.
They have a time of energy, airplanes, and airplanes as well as less-relative warheads and less radios, as well as less radio, radio, and the Red Sun.
Other important organs include long - term boundaries — new ships must be able to keep their feet steady for two years from the initial portals.
However, the ends are the most recent years that allow for German powers to protect the power of the country, as well as when they are in service.
When the German Navy refused to use private transportation and returned to the Blodom and Voice dock in Hamburg, unfortunate F125 was a major news story in the past year.
This was the first time that the Navy sent a ship back to Rome.
Although knowing the reason for sending back, a military mission was assigned by the German media for a number of serious "virtals and hardware weaks" that could not be useful.
By the age of half a million ships in the Bronmburg class, some of the old brree class of the Ra's School, which has ruled over 120, the software is important.
Similarly, the boat is extremely heavy, and it reduces its activity and limits the ability to add growth to future growth.
Ten thousand weights are believed to be twice as heavy as the German ships used by Germans in World War II.
When the bug hardware is turned off, the crew is making a price of training, including training the project.
It is said that from 2.2 billion to 3.6 billion (U.S.) in Europe, Europe has reached a very large level.
It is especially important to take care of the latest navigational warnings in Germany.
In the beginning of this year, the Navy accepted Hans Bartle's Chief Committee of the German Parliament.
The officer said that the old ships had been removed from the old ship but that the problem had not yet been developed with time.
He was sorry that the ships in Beddon-Weberg's class could not be connected to the Navy.
The national responsibility is to listen to the secret of the bats ’ secret life
The aim of a new research project in Scotland’s mountains is to reveal how the bats use the sky in search of their food.
These findings have provided a new light on the behavior of Anan Jegan, who has been known for his behavior and has been able to help the future research.
A study by the National Institute of Sciences for Scotland found that a public and Zoppo Rapaist’s park in West Rhodes will be observed on the common and far north coast of West Rhodes.
In order to monitor the vanilla activity around the winter, there will be a special recording machine in the main areas around the property.
The NHS's crew and volunteers will be able to use mobile tracking by hand.
Specialized audio analysis of all the recorded audio analysis will find the number of bats and what to do.
It will then be presented with a map and a report on their behavior.
Robert Deved, a genetic instructor in Entebbe, expects the most important settlements to be carried out and the result is the result of the resulting effect that they are being used by specialized people in Entices.
This information will help to counter the effects of local management’s management activities, such as the design and the construction of the dams and other related properties.
During the past century, the bats ’ tree has grown to be considered to be the most important part of the world.
They are threatened by building and development that affects resources and property.
The spider's paper and building can be a chemical treatment and a chemical operation of carbon dioxide and petals, but the winds can pose risks by air pressure and lighting.
The bats are not blind to the truth.
However, their silent hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes to catch prey.
They use modern fishing technology to detect signs and obstacles in their flight route.
More than 290 historical buildings throughout the country, more than 370 square feet [8,600 m] of important interest, and 76,000 square miles [76,000 sq km].
There are about ten trained experts, who have been trained to investigate four lines of evidence, and they may also be involved.
This organization has established the first and the same veterinary model in Scotland and in the rest of the town of Dumfres and Gallos, and it has been built in 10 other species of bats in Scotland.
David Thompson says that the garden is the ideal place for them to live.
"But we have a large territory for the vanilla plant," he said.
"We have old buildings, old trees and good homes.
But there are still many things we still don't know about livestock, so we will help to understand what they need to grow up here and other property."
He points out the importance of checking the soil before the destruction of an entire planet by killing 400 animals and young animals as well as the whole population.
It is illegal to kill them, harass them, or destroy their dinners.
The Scotland Officer Elizabeth Ferrrril, in charge of the farm archives, has been subjected to the assistance of the public.
She said: "We have much more to learn about our forest and we don't know how to grow up for many of our species."
Rolfnado’s refusal to publish corruption has resulted in the arrest of the German newspaper
Christophoro Rolando was described as "Worlddondo", and using his name, says that people need to be "tweeted."
His lawyers are ready to protest against a German news magazine published by Dr. Spigal Hull.
In 2009, a American woman named Kathryn Magoga, who was in a hotel room in Las Vegas, complained about corruption.
In order to remain silent about the incident, one of his charges was accused of being charged with $ 375,000 in charge of the case.
A few hours after the charges were reported, his followers took 142 million of them in an issue of Instegram live video and watched the report as "Worlddo's performance".
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today, what they said is a fake news story, "Blan De Oro," says the winner five times in the camera.
"They want to use my name to build themselves up.
It's normal.
They want to be known as my name, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy person and everything's gonna be fine."
Rotter's lawyers are ready to file charges against Dr. Spigal, and they are called "a "intuitive of personality" to report on the charges.
The lawyer Christian shirts said that the player was “the most serious person in the year of the death of the human rights violation of the crime that could be committed to the serious moral damage. ”
In June 2009, the trial took place in Las Vegas, Vegas, and California.
After meeting at a night club, Rolando and Mariga went back to the park and found that he had been raped by her and was allegedly filed in the writings of Clark Quartttttier, New Delhi.
Margara says that after the incident, Rolando fell down on her knees and said that she was "good man under 99" below the ground.
It is not surprising, therefore, that some couples who have had sexual relations with their mates have committed adultery with each other.
Margara says she went to the police and took photos of her wounded in a hospital, but then she agreed out of the court that she felt she would be “pulled ” and“ scared of shame in public.”
A 34 - year - old girl says that she is now trying to cancel the repair process because of the shock.
At the time of the riot, Rolando Macintosh had been preparing to join Rail Madid from Yuntyd, U.S.A., and moved to the port under a 100 million euros in this summer.
The United Kingdom will be remembered by losing the motor producers.
If the U.S. government has lost its place as a world director after the BCCS, then the United Kingdom is said to be “will be sad forever.”
If the British continue to leave the European Union, Toyota, in the United States, has been able to say that the production of his factory in Duran, near Darton, has been temporarily restricted by the British.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese motor industry said that the effects of the slowing down of traffic accidents in the country will be increasing.
By the last year of the service of Oresans in Tokyo and Avases, some 150,000 motor vehicles were produced, and 90 percent of the European Union's population were condemned in other countries.
"If the British leave the European Union at the end of March, we will see how our industry will be able to stop the production of our industry" is my idea that the director of the Berlinans in Tokyo.
Other motorists in the United States, including Hong Kong, were afraid to leave the country’s commercial system without an agreement on how to go through the border.
For example, BMBLW says that a month after B recallCs, they'll close their factory at Oxford.
What car manufacturers say is the key to the safety of the car’s maintenance supply in an uncomplicated bacterium.
Every 37 minutes for a motor car in the United Kingdom and the United States each time, a "national time for Toyota's production" will be set in the basis.
The U.S. state of the United Kingdom says that if the U.S. government is removed from the European Union on March 29 without a deal without a deal, there may be a barrier under the border, and it could cause the delay and the loss of parts.
The Toyota company may not be able to keep more than a day's repairs in Darby's camp, and it says that the product will be stopped by the company as the company says.
Mr. Clarke said that the plan for the future relations with the European Union was "in the direction of the drawing of this dam in the border" was fully applied.
"We need a deal of business agreement. Not only to enjoy the success of present success but to say that this time we need to make the best deal to earn the planet."
"Not only from Toyota but also from other producers, the evidence is that we should be able to keep up with the most successful supply.
Toyototototota is unable to say how long production works, and additional workers are expected to lower the industry’s competition and increase the job at the end of the job.
The 24 years have been serving in Berlin, and Peter Tswana, a member of the U.S. Ministry of Health in the camp, said that it would be more demanding for its members to be anxious: “My experience has not been saved.
A government official said: "We have made a right and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Roussein and Trump of the White House reveal that the meeting could be delayed
Since the Supreme Court won't allow the battle to continue in the war against Yinita B.C.E., Donald Trumza was called the decisive meeting to meet Rod Rosestenin, the judge "after a week".

That is why the exporter Chris Wallace asked for it.
Sananders said that the media didn't get involved in the debate because of the lack of respect for television reports, and she added: "I don't agree with the fact that they are dancing to the devil."
Then she suggested that there would be more direct visits between Trump and media.
"The president will hold questions and answers more than any president before, and he says, "We'll count it."
The media discussion continues, but Sanders said, "If the president of the United States has a chance to ask directly questions, it is better to talk to me than to talk to me."
We're trying to do it very much, and you've seen it happen many times over the past few weeks, and it's going to get you to talk to the President of the United States."
The answer will be answered when Trump goes out of the White House or when it comes to open windows or open windows or news.
They've discussed the press's in a lot of trouble.
In New York City this week, the president would have explained why the conduct of public reporters and at times taking a weird look at themselves.

The Scotland government has already agreed to raise the funds for the repigments of the European Union to serve its public services.
“In summer, ” says Miss Remnman, the article, “the discussion between the United Kingdom and the European Union and the United Nations is taking an important decision in this season.
However, the government of the United States is preparing its own time for any uncomplicated business.
Surely I know that you will have a long time together.
I wanted to resurface how much I appreciated their contribution to each member of the staff.
During the European Union and its Allied countries, people have had outstanding experience and skills to build and enhance their health skills, and it has benefited the sick and the kings we serve.
In fact, Scotland is your home and we need you to stay here."
