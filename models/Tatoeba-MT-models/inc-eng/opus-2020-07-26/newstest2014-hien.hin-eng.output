Black box in your car?
While the U.S. road designers are struggling to improve the low-technology system, there are a lot of people looking at it in small black box, which leads to the debrief boarding of your car.
This device, which tracks every mile by motor driver and communicates the information to authorities today, has become a controversial attempt to destroy the old system's main roads in the United States to resolve the loss of the old system and the Kingdom Office.
In general, like the high altitude, the work has become a matter of sudden deep and life-diversity.
You have to keep the record of the drive saved, and then use this information to prepare the taxi Bill - to support the government on the side of using these black box groups.
The tea party is braking.
The American citizen freedom organization too is very concerned with the various forms of confidentiality.
While the Curres does not agree that the future is to be done, there are many Kingdoms waiting for.
They're searching for how they can go to a system in the next decade to pay for every mile set on the road.
Thousands of motor drivers have already taken black box for test drive, some of which contain GPS.PS. Monitoring.
It's actually an essential object for our country.
"It's not the subject of being selected or not," says Hasan Ikkata, who is working for the Southern California government, who has been planning to start track by motorbikes in California for the year 2025.
We're about to change our way of paying.
It's professional to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's high-techfund has been nearly abandoned, which is due to the payment of the citizens of Gasp by American citizens.
American people don't buy any gas anymore.
The car goes more than before in a Galen Gas.
There's no increase in the last 20 years in Federal Texas, which has been 18.4 cent perlet.
Because of the high value of gas, the emperors try to increase a money in Texas too.
"It's not possible, it's not possible, it's not.
Their kingdom has recently started tracking devices in 500 cars to examine the daily cost system.
They say, "In the past it will work as the most logical option."
Wax it is called a multi-based user-based Spectacle.
It's not surprising that the idea of urban generosity is good, since it can be changed to work as a car-to-trade for example, which can help to reduce and reduce Granhas's gas.
California's planning plans are eager for this system while they are developing lessons to meet the specific goals set in the state's Great Global Voices laws.
But the president of the Home Transport Committee, Rep. B.B. Shuster, also believes the Black Box is the most relevant option.
The independent vendor in the restaurant is also on the side of each mile payment by the driver.
Adrian Moore, who is going to the blind, said, "It's not the only thing that's going into the darkness."
People are actually paying more for what they are getting.

It is the most interesting and most interesting one that has been listed by 5,000 drivers in the country's largest use.
The driver will soon pay the Miles Shuulk instead.
Nevada has already completed the initial investigation.
The New York City is also heading towards this direction.
Ilinos is trying with trucks on limited basis.
And I-95 Glaucin, with 17 state transport departments with East Sieward, including the 17 Kingdom Transport Department (with Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), are studying how they can operate in the process.
This idea was not found on all places.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were already trained on this device, the driver was very tired to think that the government could monitor every step.
Allan Khan says was a major problem with Bangdun and other things in the Nevada Transport Department.
It's not something people wanted.
In addition to taking the test, the NVADA's A.L.O. warned on his website: "To convert these devices into a complete tracking device is much easier."
There is no need to develop the vast, uncluttered technology framework, which must be spread to every person’s daily passing-time record.
Navada is one of the many kingdoms who are trying to achieve that potentially successful promotion, to find out how many miles the car is going every day, but not where and where he is going.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for the project led some state agencies to the small California, called Tru Milesz, to start-up.
It wasn't in the business of helping drivers basically ruled.
This was trying to get into the market outside the auto insurance market, which drivers had to pay on the basis of their miles.
But the device that is testing it was good, since it does not use the GP.S and provides a limited information on a specified time-up.
Tu Melez's head said, "If you don't drive the people away, they will probably be more inclined to drive them away."
These early events of the Kingdom have made some serious mistakes.
There are also very few costs and less interventions to do this.
In Organan, the organizers are using different-dimensional options.
They can choose your device without GP.S. or not.P.S. devices.
Or no device can be selected, but may choose to provide a fixed amount of money based on the average set by the inhabitants of the state that are set up by the inhabitants of the state.
Other places hope that the device can ruin citizens by providing more and more facilities than by providing more.
In New York City, Transport authorities are trying to develop a taxiing device that will also have access to paying the parking meter warning, "The payment of your drive will provide Bam, and other drivers will build real time data from the driver's truck.
In the city planning document, "Morators are attracted to participation because of the benefits they receive from it."
However, some travelmakers wonder that all discussion on payment according to miles may be a big investment.
In San Francisco, Metropolitan Passeng said that the Kangrets can easily deal with the problem by increasing gas tanks in gas tanks.
Other time or annual estimates may also be placed on the drivers of Hybrid or others, who do not use too much gas to pay their proper share.

They don't have any confidence in death as described by Sherif.
Komp said that they believe it's the same thing as physical laws and common sense."

"They sent their son to school with a book-back, and he returned to a bottle bag."
The U.S. vice president Michael Molere told the Master that he was checking an official investigation of Johnson's death, seeing there are a lot of important questions.
What was the cause of death?
Was his murder due to some crime?
And he said these things unto the governor at noon.
I will follow the truth, and they shall bring us to every place.
My purpose is to bring the truth to you.
He said, "I think there's an understatement cause."
Mura told the reporter that the death of Johnson was a result of “the death of the former white creature.”

C.D.C. found that 18 percent of children between 1997 and 2007 have increased in children between the ages of 1997 and 2007.
In this direction the colleges have been instructed how teachers and employees are to be shown how to be informed about children's food allergy, and how to handle it in the case of any electronic reaction.

Interpreters' parents can choose their children's 'sexual 'intercesss '
Germany's first country in the European Union has become a country that has been recognized for the third gender for children born with countless denominations.
It will no longer be specified by man or woman.
According to the new law, parents do not need to announce sex to such children, this law allows them to declare the “unclean” or “unintellectual” or “unreasonable” on child birth.
The purpose of the new law is to reduce pressure on parents and children who can quickly take the decisions related to gender-synthesis for newborns, and to fight prejudice against the Internet children.
According to B.B.C., an Internet man said years later, "I'm man, not woman."
I'll be made by medical doctors.
According to estimates, every year a child in two thousand children is born without a child.
They are Internets, part of the group of about 60 cases, which comes from a series of tests of sexual development that are used for an unusual attribute, genetics (dedical or synonym) or an unusually developed gender.
Maybe Wallace Simmons's inexplicable.
The gender identity is not still considered well, but most experts in the United States believe that it is better to use the best information available to describe sex when it is not possible to be sex-cool, and if this is done, then the child's mental development and physical development of physical development should not be considered.
In New York City, Dr. Jack Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Darder-Prunch, who is an expert in the gender-based affairs of Germany, he said that the new law of Germany seems "good"."
Internet children create moral unrest.
He said, "Some people are in a state of life that needs medical attention, but not with most children."
You can specify only the gender without a science-based program, and then see how the identity is developed.
The science of learning is not very precise in a child’s development.
No one can answer the right answer about it.
It's a kind puzzle that people are gay.
In the report of the European Commission in 2011, the Internet has been described differently to people because their position is not related to gender, but is not specifically related to physical structure, which is not clearly male or female or both.
These features can be displayed by the second secondary sexual structures, such as weight weights, hair distribution, strokes, and length; such as precipitous sexual activity; or the subsidiary structure and hormones.
The report also provides lionswagenans about the discrimination and discrimination of employees who have been faced by the Internet and transversive men, and also about violence, violence, and discrimination.
Now there are special camps for non-used girls.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed older people to mark men, women or "the third gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Australian May-well, for life, the first official "unidned" person became the first "uningless" person in the world after a legal appeal was won by the legal appeal of "uneducated" synthesis.
According to the internal transport, there will also be a third exception for the Internet people except M or F in the German passport.
According to the news report on the 24th of France, the points connected to gender in France are still controversial.
In 2011, the French rule from the Catholic country has signed up for the "ding doctrine" to go back to college books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed this law in Germany, saying, "As the world is going to be in a state of affairs where sex is being chosen, but not the current actions, we are heading towards two other pillars and two columns."
The mother of a newborn baby in Ireland also told Baby John that she would like to see the girls being married at birth.
He said on the website "There's a lot of stress, especially if you don't even know what your child's sex is."
Children need stability and order.
Historically, the children born with men and women were called Hermfriths, who were in the name of the beautiful Greek god.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered sex as a stage that could be removed and re-read.
But now many people are challenged by the moral values of physics, they realize that sex-operative work, and sometimes even medical doctors, may also be wrong about what they don't know about how to express their gender when children grow up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called "Municide".
When these children were born, you didn't call me a psychologicalist, you were calling for a professional-school.
The current principle about the treatment of innocent newborns was presented by Dr. John Mani at the University of Washington, U.S. university.
He created the word "ding identity" and argued how social and environmental sign - parents are raising the child - and determines how the child's genes and hormones are reacting to him as male or female.
But in a matter of 1966, as “Jon/Jenan,” their principles became controversial.
They advised their parents to get out of the egg and get her eggs like the Red-Palestine girl.
He said, “The governor is free from any wrongdoing, but he has made it innocent, and I am innocent.”
At 15 years of age, the child changed himself as man and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
The director said that there are still some doctors "following her image".
But in the years following the year 1990, with the Internet coming from these sex-chuckers who started to come in front of "not happy."
That was the case with 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce, who was born with X.V. man with property, but his population was unusual.
Doctors didn't clearly understand that his neck was young, or his body was big, but they were sure he could never live as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's invisible body and the egg-chickish-Chitsa were removed from him, and he was taken as a baby girl.
She was given to women Herrmon in her age 12.
He told ABCNews.com, "I knew I'm not a girl."
I wasn't happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At the age of 18, he had to be an Evolutionoplatist with him.
But when he felt confused and some confusion, he asked for medical archives.
That made him aware of the dangerous truth.
When I was born, I was married - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with D.D., who prevented his body from producing testerogenin, which caused his population not to develop properly.
After knowing the truth, he turned back to a man, he took teststone's secret and removed his breast.
He was left alone because of the advanced-school.
Today, he explains that in the organization called the Internet project to make people feel normal.
However, the method of California-based group Advocates Forr of Unfailment for Human Rights suggests that the law of German law "the law of "law and reproach" is called a "law and shame."
He says, "Many activists think that the law of Germany will move the parents to make immediate decisions and to assign the child "unionized" to the children."
We fear it will encourage intervention.
Instead of waiting for us, it's a better process to specify man or woman gender than we think.
But we don't know how the law works, so we can only guess.
Tom-Mattis said that their organization supports Australian law because "this is permitted to identify the elderly in the third gender."
He said, "The adults should be able to make their own decision about sex."
The law of Germany is related to it to specifying the time of birth.
It's not a battle to fight with newborns at this time.
While growing up, they can take their own decisions related to their body.
But St. Erlen Bart, the St. Petersburg's Center for Women's Development, with a daughter who helps hundreds of other people in the Support Group, said that Germany’s law would give both parents and children "give power to both parents and children."
Bartji's daughter was born with men of property, but she was called the full-departionless anti-d.
Because her intelligence was wrong in the area, so women in Kata was developing awareness.
There's Johnny in his body, but there's no abortion or DDI.
Now 29 year-year-old Kati is married, and the child psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania University is in the Child Psychology Department.
Although she's drunk, she hopes to be a mother through taking a bullet or through a public survey.
"This law allows parents to make their own decisions quickly."
It gives them time and time to understand and apply some tests before they write, ‘man’ or ‘human’.
In this way, you stay well - raise your child, love the baby.
You have a dear child and enjoy him.
We don't need to do any medical-school indiscriminately that can't be returned.
He says, "It brings children into the process and frees parents from fear that they do not believe that they're right."
Finally, the child will determine which gender he is more easily with -- and it's very good.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.

George Kirwin: Ur Wihlton gave the option to Scott
Another day, another story of fear of freedom.
This time we are warned that as the condition of the E.U, free Scotland will need to join the independent travel area in Europe as the condition of the E.U.
On Beirut, the passport control and the thresholds of the Continental of the Contiguments of the Continent.
The truth is that the streptilide paper described the possible economic benefits of freedom with the rest of Europe, although not widely described in Hadidentins.
No one described the E.U.S. members in most of their time, changing their basic rules according to their requirements.
Because there is no Scotland Shadow area, so Bruce's actually going to leave for the non-nursal bridges instead of what he really wants from Scotland.
So, then, A-Khani.
And the thing that has been so long has come up. First, I heard the word "freedom of freedom means passport control" about 40 years ago.
Still the rock point was lost to hearing this fascinating old story again.
Why should free Scotland expect Europe to break?
Why would you like to be the cross-visses of London's crew, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the great, the war-time plan to organize Europe has stopped at the end.
With Euro crisis, the project has been officially dead.
dedicated groups are getting strong enough strength to resist E.U.S. or to close Euro as similar currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroscal altechtist Alterov for the German Party that was founded this year - suddenly received about half a million votes in September, and thus the free demographics of our Liberators (the equivalent of our Liberty demases).
The plan to build the Union Europe is always against domestic violence.
The present economic crisis, however, proved to be a fundamental change.
As with the harsh rules of Berlin and European Central Bank, many people have to think that the project has been so far away from Europe.
There was no greater role in the loss of Euro's crisis in the biggest budget of the national governments - such was the only truth in Greece.
In fact, the Euro system established its members to seal up the seal rate on German Exports - something that the German political party wants to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestication, South Europe finds itself in a state of potential damage in the internal loss of production compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce Vietnam and public addiction - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
On the fast budget and currency problems, the high European producer is a patient who suffers from serious health problems.
As for French and German energy companies, the "light" energy policies that are set up by the "high" U.S. government are paid for double and four times for electricity in comparison to the United Nations.
It's a loss to do, which we've already seen in the Grangamau.
Even in the world, the European Petrooclasts can't avoid the effects of the S.S. Shell gas.
As a result, the spirit of rebellion in the people is creating, especially in France, who was the main fancier of the E.E.
After Greece, French top politicians saw the UN control of Germany, and Paris was the solution to the loss of property in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political justice, and it has applied its own financial policies on Europe, which has caused France to collapse.
The result is: The South Asian National Front recently won the Royal Society's victory at the third place, Mary Lee Lee Pan, the southern part of the E.U.N. National Front.
At this time, the most popular group in France is with 24 percent votes – it's time for British labs to not run to the left that they can't believe they can't walk to the left.
What are you doing with your new reputation in the work class?
The group is using the E.U.S. choices that will be the next year to make E.U.O., anti-sectant, anti-corruption charges.
If, as most possible, the E.U.T. forces show good in these choices, this kind of type can affect the European Parliament first.
My view is this: In Europe, the E.U.P. and the most popular anti-corruption feeling will soon end up with Euro.
Euro will not be completely complete, but it will be back in some form of " Europe of the nations" that will support General De Galil.
Germany and some of its privatizations can keep Euro, but France and South Europe will resume their currency.
I hope that U.S. will keep the U.S. itself away from this project.
However, the growth growth growth in the Pacific indicates that British will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What about Scotland?
We can choose to stay in the area of Little England (Irrawaddyally).
Or we can protect our own own financial interests - which includes telling Berlin and Bruce to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better work in the loose European system, but I guess we'll keep our own seal.
It would be easier to work with other countries of non-religious nations in Europe.
Otherwise we should think about keeping our financial freedom on the way to Norway.
In Scotland, S.P.A. - the most successful military activist in Europe - the most successful political campaign in Europe, who was opposed to the proposal by Laser Eliser Darling of Labbling (The Action of Religions), and after his victory-Develing in 2011 was a marvelous year.
For Scotland, it would be wise to vote for freedom at this time, for in that case it would have to accept the law of the Mittinger and Brasss in that situation.

Researchers indicate that African-American and Hessic girls are at a lower age than their age group.
Physical change does not mean that yawn is equal
There are no evidence that hormones or other chemicals can be blamed
Experts believe that the condition may be a cause of osteoporosis in a lower age
Before time, the matter of sex is not as effective as boys
According to CNN's former negotiationist Patit Ethrie's health and family issues, there are experts on the health and family issues.
Should the mother be concerned if her daughter’s development and development of breast cancer should begin at the age of 7 or 8?
This week, this week, the child's medical doctor Dr. Paul Kaaplought, at the dedication of the U.S. Child College of Child Child Medicine in Florida, Florida, made it clear that these early physical changes are common among American girls.
Caploitz says, "I spend a lot of time to make sure that it does not reflect a steady progress in the direction of the full-time channel."
The actual symptoms of development, such as breast-feeding, are showing the time between the hair and the skin and the skin.
But in the past four decades, there has been a very radical change in the life of Rasam magazine-Tari.
In United States, average age 12.5, which was 1275 in 1970.
"When the breast starts to grow, the first look goes at at at least three years in the vision," Capoolvit says, "the time-e-first issue is: to deal with this problem is also the author of the author."
It's the most accurate test time of biodiversity.
What's the origin of Javan, but when the breast grows with breast development before 8 years of age, it's called it "ba-birth".
In most cases the process will be slow or stop - those with the child doctor who can look closely.
In the case of more confused progress, it may need to be tested by the anesthesiological level so that the chances of such serious problems can be solved.
The time-old journals and other consequences are treatment for delays: old age-time growth, which may lead to unsatisfied growth and old age.
Cigarettes for drugs or hormone treatment depend on children's age, growth rate, rate, and emotional age.
Mental aspects are also important.
The capsulets are about drugs, but accept, "Driving can increase emotional points, and girls may feel different from their peers."
The second big problem can be understood: the motivation is not just their lack of income to the daughter of the young girl.
"They worry about the risks of pregnancy, or how can they keep clean?"
A woman who had started a monthly religion when she was 10 years old recalls, "This was a shock."
Although there were signs of this, we talked about the monthly-time, but she wasn't emotionally ready.
She was afraid of her school and came back to trouble that she had been the first magazine religion in her colleagues.
There are many practical principles about the causes of psychiatry.
Yet, there is no constant witness that there is no constant witness that hormones in milk or other food items could be charged with in hormones, chemicals, or media in the environment.
Boys too are receiving time-of-the-time genes.
Caploitizes this rule determines that its most major reason is the extension of the environment.
He helped study studies on girls over 6 to 9 years in 2001, which connects the body to the age of yawn.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are also many other dangers that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Hindu girls have the tendency to get out before their life girlages are born.
There are a lot of explanations.
On the global level, time-on-East yawn is affected by the effects, from economic conditions to weather and genes, all things are affected.
Other statistics: although children are getting older in the age of face and gender, they are not completely clear among the girls.
Other doctors who were attending the A.P.A. conference supported the subject of the subject.
It is so common for children and children to see the hair of the wild beast.
“We need to be careful about how we really know how we really know the real origin of yontton, ” says Dr. Lawrence Schillerman at the University of Washington, New Jersey, U.S.A.
The characters should not be reluctant to take guidance from their child doctor to talk to their children.
Caploitz advised, "This means it could mean conversation before expected."
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond properly.
In time, girls who grow up need to be assured that even if it's already in the past, it's part of normal life.
The giant took place at the temperature of 3.1 degrees Celsius.
On Wednesday morning the rain and the cold wind made the people feel better.

And in the morning the people saw the sun.

The debate for the seat width on the big Order of jet producers.
This month's dispute has been a struggle for Dashasharo for long-term flights between the front-class flights for flights.
The debate is focused on the height of the Economy Class in the long flights of the Economy class, not always given by Erline, but by St. Airlines, which claimed to be the key.
The largest seat of Econonomy in the Econominy Cabein this week has hope of such an Instrument standard, but it must be determined by Argentines.
The debate comes between the production of the airplane when the potentially high - speeded Air Force in order to sell the company’s largest weight connected by 17-21.
How is the previous segment of the plane built -- especially if the seating is 9 or 10 is equal to 100 or 10 of the more capable ones, the design of Minie Jabo Zets is being developed in mind?
Bogg says it's made "777 X", which will place 406 people in 17 inches and 10 in a row.
Airbes says that with the A350s, it will take 350 people to be held in 18 inches by 18 inches.
The plane speed is often on business matters through advertising in business press.
Now, with Airbes 777 X, there's hope to have more than 100 yards on Sunday, like this to appeal to the public.
It's recently seen that the video began at the beginning of the war, would you accept it with three in a restaurant together?
The Airbes Bank, the chief John Leiyi, also offers long flights from the Bang area Tarbo.
As a change, people are getting better, but the plane doesn't change the way to sit down.
During the 1970 ’ s, the Boing 747 - 10 - year - old U.S. tour of the U.S. health department, which defines modern - day Turkey, and the U.S.A., an average 40 - 49 - 49 - year - old American Navy, according to the statistics of the U.S.A., declared that I had a 10 percent increase in weight.
According to American Health Statistics, the average U.S. man's temperature is 39.7 inches, according to the U.S. health statistics of the 21st century.
Airbes says that it has been sloppyed with a seat in the 1950s when the new name was called "Jet Set," was the average member of the group.
Airbes says that they have set up a research staff that suggests improvement in the quality of an additional 53-year-old sleep level in the height of the seat.
Boeing argued on the underlying issue of the Erebus’s seat measure, and said that it does not depend on the decision of the creators how the Irish Kyrenia makes a balance between the sale and facilities.
It also says that the research reveals that a seat’s experience depends on the experience of a cabin more than the width of a seat.
Bogging Kevin Kraveer said, "It's actually a fact of providing wires and belief that they need to do what they need to succeed."
"They don't want to tell us what they have to do."
They know better their business than anyone else.
It's about the cervix room for the Flyseers, but it's a quick point for visitors to have it affected.
After the debate, at least 700 billion dollars of business is estimated to be in the decades following the debate, in the decades following the debate, sufficiently.
Rita's report said the first time in July, what seats can be found in July, actually the battle between new jet planes.
Airbes and Boeing claimed 20 percent of their new set of seats in Engeny, compared to 365-CCT Bogging by 777-300 Aar.
The claim of Boeing’s presentation depends on the comparison of 777 x 9 original with design.
10 times 10 is now used with profit in the cost.
Kevin Konstantin, from Europe's Airlines Travel Service, says, "It's going to take control of their planes, along with our products, to control more seats."
On the other hand, scholars say that the whole 10-Cit-Cline cabin has suggested that some passengers are at the side of the Danner Leout, which can go along with Stella.
The cabin expert called my Corbin expert, author and editor's daughter, the network of the Akranese, said, "It would be very nice for the seats of the Akreys, but the reality is that it's the business of Airbes is handled by the threat of the event of 777."
Airbes and Bogging seats don't communicate with seats but are providing a list of users to select from the Airlines.
The jet vendor around the world will also be careful to check this layout.
With a lot of rest, all buildings are also offering high densitys for jet plane services and field travel.
The Airbes is giving you a 10 equals A350 but says it's not sold right now.
But recently, as soon as the Airbees insisted on some of its jet planes to need more cabin access, some of its special cable sites were on the Internet.
A new industry is not likely to fly on a standstill without the support of modern jet planes, but it can turn off the glass of 77 XD.
The New Anti-Nintenine Vincinene can finish the joy of smoking.
Scientists have developed an anti-intentionive vaccine that can end the life of smoking.
One of the only killers of Vinxin was able to protect the rats for a whole lifetime of life.
Man needs more tests before testing, which may take years, but the professor of the Royal Medical College of New York said that there are positive symptoms.
Professor Cornel said, "We hope that this kind of vaccine can help millions of people who have attempted to quit all forms of smoking in the market today, but they found that their present power is more powerful than their current power."
New Vicin is a harmful virus that has been prepared to bring genetic information to the purpose of making anti-incombatable anti-incombatable information.
This enables the virus, selectedly rehydration the cell that then begins to form a permanent drop of antibody.
The Entebbes search for any protein molecule in the blood, and prevents them from rising under nicotine before they reach the brain.
In a test, the vaccines were given that later stated, they continued to perform their normal activity.
Researchers say, but the rat that was not sold to the vaccine seemed "very good," it was a sign that Nikotan had arrived to his brain.
The use was described in the Spanish transliteration Medinian journal.
The vaccine of the former tobacco vaccines failed because they were anti-Boddiz.
It would have to be a regular interval, so that the antibody's level of antibody could be made, but it proved to be expensive and illegal.
But the new vaccine prices are expected to be too much, since it will make the cell a factory of antibody.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccines remain completely secure, it could be given to children before they could be saved from nicotine's addiction.
But it will probably be used to avoid smoking by people who smoke.
He said, "They will know that if they start smoking again, they will find no joy in smoking because of Nikotan’s addictions.
British scientists complained about the result, but warned of the need for more research.

Triddy Obeid refused to be impressed by us.
The former NSW minister who will be tested by the State Capsson Watchug on the Triedi.
The former NSW minister, who has refused to uphold the policies that his political leader, Eddy Obidde, has refused to comply with his policy's wishes on the wishes of the former New South Wales, who was responsible for three landlords.
On Friday of August 2005, after his release, Mr. Obid's trial against corruption, was it widely known that Mr. Obidd's policy against many state governments has been violated by two retireds and Cafia, without permission of Obidari and Caif, in August 2005, after his final trial in 2005.
Linsupal, a former sub-softifed witness given to Thursday, was known by Mr. Vauddy, Mr. Obid, after the witness given to Thursday?
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government forced the public bar to begin.
The guards were against it, and they wanted time and time.
In 2009, OBWD was released from the TED $55 million, without any shoes.
Mr. Trikudy, who had been the minister of the porters from February 2006 to November 2009, was at the side of the public bar.
But they refused to change on Mr. Obid's request, Mr. Tikpudi requested a change in government policy.

The Israeli has failed to attack the missiles within Syria at least twice a two years ago.
In 457 foreign workers on Vija can be detected by a test of the "patientity" test.
The government is being considered to be a "consistent" test for foreign workers on V 457 by the government, because its purpose is to extend a harsh act.
If this is done, this experiment will be applied by a combination of a set of values that will be used by the work of 457 to prevent the use of block 457 in Australia.
A government discussion was released today, before M.M.M.M.M.M.M., against the government's word of foreign workers against the government's word-reference, said Max McKuw today that it could disrupt Australia's neighboring the country.
He told the U.S. India Int today that "the foreigners are coming to the end of Qatar" and "Estalian people have been very unhappy at a time, while Greece has asked for a secure market."
Historically, it was the intent that white workers should have been provided protection - and if some in the region had seen a rejection of that historic witness, I would not be surprised.
The discussion shows the focus of 12 measures, which was previously considered by former Prime Minister Chris Bowan.
The minister Braden O'Conner who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met the authorities about the people who were forced to move, has initiated five contracts, while there are other concerns.
If the term "diverity" is taken, the Vija Amin can be described as "what is true in circumstances such as the person, the person who is known as the owner of a person or the individual who is a person or a person who is a person of authority.
Businesses may need to count the number of V 457, since the first business worker who wanted to be employed in less than a number, has kept hundreds of people at work.
Meanwhile, 35-year-old Sri Lanka refugees died from a heart attack after the arrival of a refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The only nine-year-old son of that man had come with him on his journey to Australia, and after his father's death, his older brother had buried his old brother, who was on the same spot.
Australian authorities brought the man to the hospital, after which he died.
The study has been announced to increase the benefits of Scotland by the British government by the HS2 railway project.
The work by HS2 is directed to high speed services in the north part of Scotland and England, which will soon begin with the first step in 2026.
Transport minister Barons Kremer told that this project would be one of "Brenen".
The Ministry of Transportation in Scotland said that they are very “relative” by working with the British government on this project.
The first step will include a new high speed line between London and West Midlands.
When the second step is completed, the lines will reach to Maine and Lids.
In June, the government measured the high speed link between London and North England by measuring 240.7 B.C.2.26 B.C.E.
The British government, who was communicating with Scotland Transport, directed to consider the possibility of building a railway capacity and travel time for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a possible travel period from Glossgo and Edinburgh to London for three hours or less.
According to Barons Kramer: "Our goal is to have the real national network, which will bring closer to Ukraine and its cities."
We're moving along with HS2, because its benefits will be too much.
Without this, we will face problems related to our railway network's capacity.
But it is also about the connection between 18 cities of Golasgo and Edinburgh, which will be connected to the 18 cities in Britain, which will be better added because of HS2.
According to Scott's secretary Aliist Carmic: "Today’s declaration is good news for Scotland."
For the Scotland government, Kit Brown, Mr. Carmic appealed to the "fashion" of Scotland on the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high speed is likely to benefit Scotland from a lot of financial benefits, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the whole of Britain.
So we are excited to work in the British government's shares so that we can test the options to create high speeds in Scotland, to create benefits for all, and to fulfill the Glasgo-Adenberg line that has already been planned.
I'm ready to review the report with the British government's ministers next year and make decisions along with the next action.
Airspace device rules will be effective in Australia right now.
In US, a soft step going down the runway in the device stations, Australia Airlines will have to continue to shut down your tanks and smart calls when the plane is down.
US International Airlines Administration has left the option to change its processes to the American Air Services Company, to read e-book, to watch and play games on its devices, and to stay in the "time" mode.
The passengers can do this right now, but many people don't seem to be unable to reach their E-book when they blow and blow up the plane.
Australian Air Force Service Committees are thinking about this decision, according to which US Airlines service companies will have to do much more work to meet this need, but they indicate that they have no plans to change their processes.
Citizen Airport Security Authority also said that he is thinking about the announcement, but insisted that there are restrictions on the use of electronic devices in Australia still in the main stages of flight.
"In the current CASA, there's no specific design that controls air pollution in the plane," said the chairman, "this point comes to the conclusion that the plane's service companies have always been fully established, and the security system has to ensure that the security system has always been fully established by the team.
Vervin who is already communicating with CASA about to extend the use of his in-flat-free-free entertainment system, he is already ready to follow this change, but he asked for the direction of Wikipedia.
"We will welcome the review by CASA in the case of the use of electricity tools, because we really think it will provide better experiences, since we have (residelets) in our airplanes now.
Katniss said it would follow the current rules.
He said, "We can't be used with air tools while we're driving and down the plane, and we have no plans to convert it."
FAA decision, applies to American Ellines.
Well, we are always interested in the commercial development that can benefit visitors, and we will surely consider the reasons behind FA and the reasons behind it.
The decision will affect every US Air Services Service Company and will depend on their planes.
Computer service companies will need to prove that their plane service companies can endure radio abuse with their airplane mobile devices, as well as their rules, training materials, programs, programs, and marketing facilities.
FAA said, "After the death of the Airlines, he will allow the passengers to use all the high-ranking tools, such as satellites, e-readers and smartphones to use."
In low vision, the drivers will command to shut down their device while they drop the plane.
The group has also suggested to place heavy devices safely under seat or in upper rooms during flights.

325 million free dollars package for Tuji's health
The organization has stressed that the health system has also been associated with the protection package for 325 million dollars that will ensure that the State’s government cannot destroy the government's regime.
The Federal Health Ministry of Health announced that the United States, the island’s older population, the high rate of disease, and the current crisis in the system is being dealt with by the limits of the system.
During four years, the decision of the Wi-positor-positor decision to have been made after the government's release with the freedom of conscience from the government's freedom of conscience.
"Critically, Mr. Pessserkar today, has brought a package of emergency safety packages, which we believe will satisfy special challenges facing the state.

The blast of the bomb blasts in Bali
In 2002, 202 people who were killed in Bam threatened by 202 people and relatives, crying at the time of the bomb blast, saying that the Amara Tuc should face the firing team.
To Tuk, who was part of one of the most interested people in South-East Asia for about 10 years, was told 20 years of his role in building the explosive device in the bomb blast.
He can be released in 15 years when he is released.
At 45-year-old Umira, two military murders were found in the capital city of Kuta, where 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many were injured.
He was also found guilty of several other accusations related to terrorism, including a series of series of deaths held in the church in Indonesia on the eastern Christmas Eve in 2000.
The organizers asked for the life of life, although they could demand that it be said that this person was the victim of the "superious man" who was called "unsurpassed by the mutiliary man."
This decision has republished the painful memories of female June Cortin, who lost their 39-year-old girls in the disaster attack by the female woman who lived in West.
When he stopped his eyes, he said he should have been put to death.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other terrorists.

FA: Airlines can now use the gas in air (can not call from the cell phone)
Air travelers will be able to read from the aircart to get off the gate, to work, to play, to watch, to listen to music - but not to talk to their cell phone system - this is the most-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-day new approach.
But the passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference in F.A. Michael Harta said how fast these changes are to be handled, it would be different in every airport.
Airlines will indicate how their planes complete new directions, and how are the rules of members of their team's team training and collections to show directions.
F.A. said that this has already been achieved by some agencies to extend the use of the portable electronic device on the plane.
Delta and Zetblue are from those Airlines who have already presented plans.
In a statement, F.A., he said, "On the condition of the design, we can accept the extended use of electronic devices very quickly.
Meanwhile, the passengers need to close their smartphones, toilets, and other devices when the airport is closed.
They are expected to reach 10,000 planes' heights and not be allowed by Captain.
The passengers are expected to turn off their device while the plane is down, and don't start until the plane is completely off.
F.A. said, "In the end of the new direction-lines that are full of Airlines that are full of air electronic wastes, they can allow their passengers to use flights, planes, planes and taxis."
Most of the new Airlines companies and other airplanes that have been updated in this way are expected to fulfill these standards.
Laura Gladinging, president of the Association of Social Flight, has welcomed these changes.
Glading said, "When the policy becomes secure and we work together with the Air Forces, we'll win the both sides."
When this point comes to the point, we've been burning like "Hol Montentouss" -- they're warm.
Eggsy said, but it would still be banned to connect Internet access to at least 10,000 feet high by connecting, broadcasting, uploading e-mails, sending messages, or downloading data.
The passengers will be asked to keep your smartphones, the internet and other devices in the Airlines mode.
So there will still be no conversation with friends, online Scabbel, which is the famous event that was associated with the game, when Eric Baldwin was playing on his smartphone during the year 2011, and when he refused to stop the device, the American Airlines removed from the plane.
And still need to store the laptops, such as a large device, because they'll be concerned about the other person in the cabin to get hurt.
Celon calls will continue to be banned during the flight.
The United Nations Human Rights Management Organization (FA) has access to the phone call, not with F.A.
Some electronic devices can be blocked during flight and down the plane.
Last month Mark Rosen of the National Transport Security Council, the National Security Council of the C.B.S. News Specialist, said that the cell phone is still considered responsible.
Every day he said, "Sel phone is really serious, not just because they can create a barrier to the navigation-related device, but because they can also create a mobile phone tortose when they are in air."
In order to examine this point, the chairman of the underground industry at F.A.A. stated that the government should allow personal electronic devices to be used.
In recent years, pressure has been increasing.
S. Claire McKick, like D-M, has said there is no valid security reason for condemnation.
These restrictions are also getting more difficult because the device is being used.
Some studies also indicate that about three third passengers forget the direction to stop their device or ignore it.
F.A. began to ban the use of electronic devices by private users in 1996 when the passengers were received a report in Venezuela and communications reports about the use of F.M. radio and the high-sharing gas at the time.
New Airlines companies, compared to the previous generation of planes, have been more dependent on electronic systems, but they have also been designed and approved to resist electronic intervention by F.A.
Airlines have been proposed by passengers for years on the crossing height.
The latest planes for the Y-Fi system are even more resistance to the abuse.
Horttara said that most Airlines companies should agree on the qualifications of the candidates to use more electronic devices in the end of the new direction-relation device.
Today's electronic device of today, generates a lot of power transmissions than the previous generation's electronic device.
For example, E-Radders, for example, is a total transition of a uniqueness during the transfer of the page.
But transitions are generated by the device or by the device while the device is downloaded.
The device used by passengers is also one of those who seek to reduce the ban.com.
In 2011, the company's officials loaded their entire band of E-Raders in the Airlines and threw him to test the problems but no problem was found.
The FF.A committee has highlighted the risk of using the device.
Dags Kid of the National Air Force Department said that he believed the drug is real, even if it's the case.
Other member of the committee said that only pilots have been described in support of the device in the Air Software System, most of them old.
However, the committee members of the committee allowed the F.A. pilots to stop the device when they dropped off the plane in less detail.
The journey industry group has welcomed changes and has also had a general knowledge of people traveling to the latest tour of the summer.
The C.E.R.O.R.D.D.D., said we're happy that F.A. is not going to be unmanned with the joyful tourers, security and security.

Are Europe’s top class of Europe ready to work with Britain?
In April, business was launched, and it was promised to bring the business together and determine what change would be in our relationship with the U.K.K.P.P.P. and the rich producer E.U.
We asked them what they think about the British's business with E.U.
Yu-Gove has thought about 1,000 business leaders, representing the commercial shape of Britain, areas and places.
The conclusion of this survey can be surprising for many people.
We found that a large part of business wants to export out from Europe now, and focus on the countries that are becoming modern and increasing, while E.U.S. members are going to be unsatisfied.
They want the government to give priority to new commercial relations with nations such as China, India and Brazil, not to the long and bitter process of reforming the secret institutions of E.U.
When asked about the specific policy fields, such as the product from a copyright license to the product, most business leaders believed that these regulations should come back to Westminster.
Business said that the value of Brazil’s economy is far more than the benefit of the profit of the commercial field of Europe - and even the vast business that is generally associated with European companies, 40 percent agreed on this.
At the end and most clearly, our survey of secular leaders found that a large part of Britain wants clearly to move on the way to the way of business and political change.
This conclusion, which was seen in the standards of major business groups, pointed out that business is inspired by a "international change", which would give back power to UK.
It's a high price - the point of a change for Britain and a better deal for Britain has changed 16 percent in the E.U.
The prime minister should not be in doubt: The survey shows that Britain's business, E.U.
It also pointed out that businessmen expect to change a positive change in the current power balance to support the UK.
A better deal for British businesses is possible, and very fast it is being necessary, since Eurojan, related economic and political organization is moving forward.
The priority must be to increase jobs and increase in Britain, as the conclusion of our survey shows that business means that business means a new policy on business and a new economic process.

Scientists have put light on the matter and what is the relationship between the cemeteries of the dog's legs and his trap.
The previous research shows that the happy dogs are much more powerful than the dogs (with the eyes of the dog), while Bean dogs are usually more bold to the left than to the left.
But scientists now say that partners can recognize this tiny mystery of the tail and respond to it.
This study has been published in Journal County BOOYG.
From the University of Trent, a neurologist George Vallerita explained: "All of humans know that the left and right parts of the brain are involved in the inspiration that produces positive or negative feelings."
Here we have tried to see it among the nations.
He pointed out that in dogs like humans, the right part of the brain was responsible for the works and the opposite order, and two bullets played a different role in feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the flight of other dogs, researchers looked at animals in the eyes of other dogs.
They measured the hearts of pet dogs and evaluated their behavior.
We probably don't have much time to understand why their doubles sometimes move on the other side.
P.. Vallerta said: "We have introduced dogs with the movies of dogs - in photographs or other points to deal with in a positive version of the West and we can see the results of the hole, and the tail's left or right to the left."
When the beasts saw a young dog lying on his right side, they were very quiet.
But when they saw the arrow turned toward the left side, their heart was stirred, and they looked at it.
They don't think dogs were trying to communicate with each other through these acts.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience about what they should be worried about and not on whom.
He said: "If you've met the other dogs many times, and if they always move their tail, it's related to the more friendly behavior and the right part looks at the same experience."
Researchers say that these conclusions can provide better information about the feelings of animals.
John Bradshaw, director of the University of Bristol School of State, explained that it is not the first study for dogs to examine whether it is important for dogs or not.
Last year, the team of University of Lincoln found that when dogs look at an American dog, they turn their head to the left and turn their heads toward their knees.
In other researchs of the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "The opposite of the study was that when the robots were forced to move to the left of the dog, the dogs were more likely to have more access to dogs than the dogs."
He said it was because it was because in various studies, dogs were not fully understood by animals or robots in movies.
He explained that it can help study ways to respond to real dogs by dogs.
"Since various cells have been found to be evidence that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still there - and there are no dogs in this case."
However, the way their behavior can be adjusted seems to be more likely to be able to understand why they're ever going to be on the other side.
The Arctic Macizi waited for Glasgogues because of Alex Turner's disease

Pope Francis will announce the name of the cardinal in February
Vatican announced that Pope Francis on February 22, the first time the Catholic Church will become a new cardinal of the Catholic Church.
The cardinals are priests in the Catholic Church, their position is only down to the pope, and they choose the pope, so Frances will determine the first group of people who will eventually help them choose their rights.
There are 201 cards.
Well, after arriving at 80 years of age, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the pope's choice of the pope - it comes into the group of 120 "consistencies" group.
According to the Vatican's official Fedrico Lambard, in an event announced that before the meeting of the new cardinals will be held, all present cards will be held.
Lombardy said, "Pap Frances has decided to make his decision to organize the pope's Pope, so that it would be easier for us to plan other meetings in various countries to share cards from different countries."
Jack Valerio of Catholic Voice said that the number of cardinals was potentially low by February.
He usually declared that the pope’s number is less than 120, as far as the number of cardinals is from 120 to 80 years, and proclaims the name of more than 80-year-old cardinals, and according to their wishes.
Valéro said, "The next year the pope will be important, because this year is the first pope after the election of France in March.
Currently there is a kind of preity to Europe and especially Italy.
He said, "It'll be interesting to see what the new Pope, even from the rest of the world, has to do with the cards.
In South America, 40 percent of Roman Catholics are Catholics, but their number is very small.
The cardinals Council of France, which is a group of eight cardinals around the world, will be the first to be selected after the operation of the Church's reformors.
Before that Pope took the decision of all things personally.
He said, "But Francis has chosen these eight cards to help himself."
He's asking French cardinals for advice.
But we're not first in this situation - it's totally new.
Valerio said that the Pope usually appoints the bishops of large places, but French "We don't know who they are about to declare the name."

The Joy of Obama’s Adolescence
I voted Obama twice in expected of change
They say that Omaha's great efforts have failed because of the G.P.P. policy of the G.P.P.
Distractions of Obama’s website can’t prevent drone attacks
The 2008 cry of Obamah Year 2008 reminds us of what could happen to those things.
Nethilal P. Morris is a second-year-old student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading very painful books today.
It is a book that I think it'll make me excited during the second year of medical school and expect me to live in hope.
The name is "the courage to win," and it is the president of the 2008 President Obama Assembly.
When I blow out of my patients by night and go to bed, it takes me to a period of time that politics inspired millions of people and could hold your breath.
The election was a single one, and news speakers were allowed to show the historical significance of that time.
The eyes of my classmates were tears of joy, and my parents saved the news they received.
A group of young dissidents were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
In 2008 they had 82 percent approval ratings while being president of Obama's president.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a hard truth, as to the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to remember a distance, a painful memory of past times.
It really changed after I first voted by me.
In simple words, there was no idea of it.
I'm crediting Obama with a lot of available sources, from the Fordbebe River, back to our army, "Don't tell us" and "Do not tell Osama bin Laden to kill him.
Besides, I believe that the policy of opposing parties has prevented many efforts to advance our country: the public option to improve, health care, and other things.
But a number of times I take myself to take care of the Obama administration as well as with fellow workers and partners, and I have to end the answer to that which I can give them.
I've reached the point of political disappointment.
Replican's opposition is not the answer to foreign leaders, neither is the answer to drone attacks on children in foreign lands.
This is not possible by national security agency to collect data about the personal life of American citizens nor can answer the actions of those who have the government's mismanagements.
It can't tell the cause of the murder of American citizens without a truck, nor the lack of public rights and tax limits during the President Campan.
The report cannot answer the conclusions of the report, which says that the effort to silence the media has been the biggest "international" attempt to silence the White House.
And most recently, it cannot give a simple website to design a simple website after three years of being signed in the Federal cable Act.
I don't know what I expected.
If, in the age of 18, I should have thought that the regime system could block the political campaign that led to it.
Apparently the unpredicted office is not an anti-constitutional way, since opposition political parties and or open-handed events, such as the neutron massacres, our public discussion.
Nevertheless, the examples I've considered above seem most likely to be selected by the administration.
It bothers you most.
I re voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was romantic with him.
The Peace Romanian presented a confusing and unequivocal option that did not appear to be the same as their policy or their position.
I thought there was another second time for Obama, free from the pressure of the choice of future choices that we have been listening to long times.
However, while Obama's application rating is less than 45 percent of this week, it has become very difficult to return through that book in 2008.
Seeing him reminds me of his past promises.
This week was reading a part of the book, which was described as a very serious loss in Pennsylvania's prime minister.
In a post-Martam Campan meeting, they told their servants that they needed to return to the bar, and they need to remain honest in their purposes.
He said, "I want to get my numbers back."
We should remember who we are.'
I can't agree with you any more than five years ago, Mr. President.
The thought expressed in this comment is the Nathal Morse.
Cleiv Palmer claimed that P.M. Tony Abbott has a positive conflict with the plan of the penal holiday plan.
The Arabic M.P.C.C. reports that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a positive struggle about the financial holiday plan because their daughters may be pregnant, and may benefit from it.
The princess of the Dinn region, who has been in debate with the bill's payment of six million dollars, claims that he has tried to answer questions about the conflict.
The Panamanized party can control four votes in the seat, which may be important to determine how to get lower prices.
But Mr. Palmer claims that only the ministers can have a positive conflict, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters can personally benefit from the principles of principles.
Mr. Palmer said: "The wife of one of their (true) women can be specially tried if she has a child. If she is pregnant, let her alone or if she is able to find some release."
Two months after the election, the choice Ayogi has officially announced Mr. Pyr’s victory from 53st seats.
Mr. Palmer asked for the selection count to move fast.
The daughters of Tony Ot are Franz and Britts.
Should the choice affect us two months later?
He said, "We should have a better system."
Why can't we have a system that we've got to have our release on the computer, immediately vote, and have the results at 6:30 p.m.
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the texts.
Because if anyone does not like him, can he be removed?
Using pencils in today’s roundabouts seems to be quite rare.
The selection is studying options for electronic selections, and recently has released an online interview with New Zealand.
The 59-year-old Mr. Palmer said their policy is to be built a international airport for Sanjan Kost, and they're taking their new job “very seriously.”
Public status is for public service.
They said: "We shall certainly serve as its stewards at this time, and we shall have no other awards."
That's why the critics had to deal with.
On this occasion, the president of the Association of Assasion, Ramesh Naji, expressed a strong shock on the violation of the laws of the country.
He proves that the criminals are being disloyal to the politicians and their communities.
They have no fear of police and administrative systems.
He recently referred to such events in different locations as when Islamic society is not safe, and the safety of the common man can easily be calculated.

The case has also been reported to the HSBC, Citygroup, J.P.M.M., and credit Susi has also received an internal investigation, or the release of media.

News about the test-dotal, which has been in the Trends of a region that has been the most useful ones in the training units of investments for years, but they have to face this challenge, because they have to face the challenge because the lower-sis due to low-terrorism opportunities.
Some bankers tried to press the case by saying that it was impossible for the vast and highly educated foreign currency to be released in exchange for the market, but the above ones said that it is not necessary to be true.
The director said that despite the vast majority of the number of foreign currency-relating platforms, the cycling platform is used by people who use their own platforms and bankers to affect the market, "You can start a little bit of the market."
The news came the same day on that day, the news of the event was announced to his Xinz Trends in London to announce this week to the Trender, who lost almost $6 million in the end of the year.
The bank immediately verified the compatibility authorizations and was supporting with its vendors.

The vine and its crew observe hundreds of diseases each week
In West African countries there are no more doctors; only for 5,000 people
Give your vote here or drop through your mobile.
Dr. Georges is one of the ten rulers of CNN.
You can vote for them or for someone other top 10 to make CNN a hero of the year.
The winner will get $50,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father come to Hosse in and without hesitation, going to the hospital, not fully satisfied to help them.
Jamal Val, in 1981 the closest car accident in Cameroon’s capital Yinda, Cameroon.
They had only broken their hands at first, but a stroke spread to their brain, and he built blood, which affected the rest of their lives.
Georges Well says, "There was no neerologist in Cameroon."
If we had the money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, he took his father and a very great multitude of people to the clinics and hospitals, and got whatever he could.
He said: "This is easy.
At 5:00 a.m. you get out of this hope that you will be the first person to visit the hospital, but not so.
There are many patients.
Some people can meet in the face of death.
There was no change in position since Vale's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5000 people in Cameroon.
If you compare, there is a doctor for every 413 people in the United States.
And if there are doctors there, many Cameroons can't afford it.
Two in the country live under the poverty line, and about two thirds of the abuse of health services in the country are private areas.
Says Well, "They're just poor one problem."
And because they are poor, they cannot enjoy their life.
And when he saw the affliction of his father, and of his people, he made sure of it.
Dr. Georges and their crew of volunteers have spent the last 700 Free Medical Center in the past year.
They also became medical doctors, and they began to work as an active surgeon at the Center of the Yvonne hospital.
And they started the non-profit organization Ecovaim, who went to rural areas to provide free medical services.
For 2008, they and their volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday they and about 30 people sit in the van, bind doctors and go to rural areas where people need medical attention.
Sometimes it doesn't even happen to them.
They have to drive more than one more time and push through rivers and dust.
But when they arrive, they receive a real honor: feast, singing, and dancing with the community.
The free medical service in these villages is actually a reason to truly celebrate, and Vale - with her great smiles and an endless amount.
The next morning, their crew starts to meet hundreds of diseases.
He said, "We're meeting 500 people every trip."
They come from the village about 60 miles [60 km] away, and they come to Pilde.
All week, they provide a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, diabetes, malaria and genetics.
Others can find the money, the money, or the free product -- the need for this document goes to school but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team has a simple social-sharing program with the local term.

He told them that it is their second job that promotes 60% of their non-actal work; the rest of the share is fulfilled in private contributions.
"I don't know when they sleep."
They're always in the hospital, or they're trying to make money for their organization to keep them running.
This is an interesting opportunity for students of medical and nursing students who come from the United States and Europe to join in Vala's campaign, which they can never get in their country.
O'Malley said, "In genetic medicine we help Dr. Well, we are capable of obtaining professional experience."
You will never have an opportunity to do this as a second-year medical student in the United States.
Volunteer students usually use them to visit Cameroon, and they often come with the medical professionals.
But after the Yendans arrive, they spend the cost of living, and the instructions.
O'Malley says, "There's no doubt they're the hero."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help Cameroon's people will never end.
For Well, almost one kind of work's not hard.
Help others to live a happy life, fulfill the promise made to their father. These are things that give them great joy.
Says Well, "I'm very happy when I do this."
And I think about my father.
I hope they're looking for what I'm doing.
I'm laughing people, it's to reduce their pain.
