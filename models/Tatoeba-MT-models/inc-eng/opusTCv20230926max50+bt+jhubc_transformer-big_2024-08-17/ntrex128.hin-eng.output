Welch's AM (Assembly Member) is concerned with 'images like Muppets'
Some members of the Assembly have objected to the suggestion that the title of their post should be changed to MWP (Welsh MP).
This is because it is planned to change the name of the Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
All AM associated with the scope of politics is concerned that this can make them laugh.
A Labour AM said his group was concerned that "it should not be linked to Twp and Pwp."
For readers living out of Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means dirt.
A plaid AM said the entire group was "not happy" and has suggested other options.
A Welsh political party said its group was "independent" about the name change, but noted that the MWP could be manipulated by making small changes orally in words.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced exactly as in the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Legislative Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a legal name change, said: “The final decision of any deponent in respect of what is called the members of the Assembly will certainly be their own matter for the members.”
According to the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission reported on the results of public consultation on proposals that received considerable support for renaming the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the title of the AM post, the Commission supported Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the most support in public advice came from the MWP option.
Obviously, AM is suggesting a number of other options, but while presiding officer Elin Jones is finding it hard to get a consensus, she hopes to present a legal draft for the change within a few weeks.
The law making for the changes will also include other changes in the working methods in the assembly, including the rules for the disqualification of AM and the format of the committee system.
At the time of arguing on law-making, AM will get the last vote on the question of what they should be called.
Macedonians are going to gather to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was held to settle a decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, a province also named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name speaks for its province and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids in the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, a rival of the referendum on the name change, says he will ignore the vote.
However, Prime Minister Zoran Zeve, as well as supporters of the referendum, have argued that the name change is only a means to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are ringing as churches in Harlem are dwindling
"The elders I spoke to about history say that earlier there used to be bars and churches on every street," Mr Adams said.
"Today, everything is going to end."
He understands the need to reduce the number of times.
He said, “Today, people’s society is being formed differently.”
“Bars are no longer like neighborhood living rooms where people visit every day.”
For the churches, they are concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders expect, "and soon these money will run out or later those leaders will come to where they started."
He further added that the churches may have been converted into proprietary apartment buildings with a variety of people who would not help in securing the remaining places of worship in the vicinity.
"These buildings will continue to grow in the number of people who are buying houses built in them as ownership rights, and thus there will come a time when these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of these people who are coming to own them will become members of these churches," he said.
A decade after St. Martin's, in 1870, both churches were built by the white people of religious society before Harlem became the Black Metropolis - the Metropolitan Community.
The original whites of the Methodist religious society moved in the 1930s.
These buildings were occupied by the black people of the religious community who used to worship in the nearby places of worship.
St. Martin was occupied by a black religious society under that clergyman John Howard Johnson who led the removal of retailers on 125th Street, the place that was the prime place for shopping in Harlem, opposed to hiring or promoting black people here.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but bells began to ring after Father Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it.
Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, Pastor David Johnson, proudly called the clockwork "opening the doors of fortune for the poor."
The expert who rang the bell in July described it as something like this: it is “a cultural heritage” and “an invaluable historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world's first bell played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who played a huge bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that no other person was put in his place in St. Martin.
Whatever happened in St. Martin over the past few months became the complicated story of craftsmen and contractors, some of whom were appointed by the common leaders of the church and the rest by the provinces associated with religion.
Parishes (priests of the area) made up of common leaders on the Vestry (where the items of worship are kept) became the authority - in July the province raised concerns that the province would "demand to meet the costs" for the Vestry, regardless of whether the Vestry was involved in hiring craftsmen and contractors employed in the province.
Some pastors in the area complained about the lack of clarity on the part of the province.
A 13-year-old boy was injured after being attacked by a shark while diving to catch crabs
Authorities say a 13-year-old teenager was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday while he was holding a crab while diving in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place near Beacon Beach in Ancinitas before 7 a.m.
Chad Hummel from KSWB-TV in San Diego said he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, at the same time he heard a boy screaming for help and then he reached out with a group to get him out of the water.
Hummel explained that at first he felt that the boy had made a sound in the excitement of grabbing the crab, but then he realized he was shouting, "I'm cutting something!"
I'm cutting something!"
Hammel said that when he saw the boy, he found that the boy's entire cane had burst.
Hammel said, “I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: there’s a shark in the water!”
The teenager was admitted to the Ready Children Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is said to be critical.
The species of shark that attacked has not been identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Gills said in a conversation with the media that a shark was detected in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found that it is not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles further stated that the upper part of the victim's torso is seriously injured.
For the purpose of investigation and security, authorities have blocked beach access for 48 hours from the Ponto Beach of the Casblad to the Swamis Beach of the Asinitas.
Giles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to go to the UK beauty market
The department is going to include boots, superdrugs and Debenhams in the store style by hiring expert assistants with Sainsbury's beauty products.
With fashion goods and home goods continuing to decline in sales, it's going to join the UK's 2.8 billion pound beauty market with good volume, with these massive amounts of beauty products to be tested in 11 stores across the country and if the plan succeeds, the business will expand to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty is being made in the supermarket, which aims to find its place in the market after bringing TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it will double its offerings by bringing up to 3,000 products for the first time, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing products from L'Or<0xC3><0xA9>al, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more opportunities with branded products found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique makeup products, so that most of the products are vegan-friendly—this will boost its demand for smaller shoppers to a certain extent.
Additionally, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will also check out the special feature at Sainsbury's' two stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second is set to open later this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
More and more efforts are being made to increase people's visits to online shopping and local convenience stores, i.e. supermarkets, in the shift of the amount of food sold every day.
Mike Coop, Sainsbury's chief executive, said that people will come to the outlet much faster than department stores because the supermarket chain is trying to compete with Aldi and Lidl, the discounters with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has been setting up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened several stores since it brought the two chains two years ago, suggesting that grocery sales have been boosted and the deal made more profitable.
A previous attempt by supermarkets to re-introduce beauty and pharmacy products to the market had failed.
Sainsbury's did business with Boots in the early 2000s, but this mixed business had to end because of the way it split revenues from drugstores in its supermarkets.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's sold 281 stores of the pharmacy business to Lloyds Pharmacy chain owner Celesio for 125 million pounds, followed by new tactics.
It was informed that Lloyds will play a key role in the plan by adding La Roche-Posay and Vichy as well as many of the best luxury skincare brands in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s’ Commercial Director, said: “We’ve changed the look-and-feel of our beauty products to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also specially engaged trained colleagues who will help us in giving advice.
We have built our brand’s scope to suit every person’s need and attractive surroundings and convenient places, which means we’ve reached attractive destinations for beauty products that challenge the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones expresses displeasure over Holly Willoughby's exit from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
To focus on his new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, when TV presenter Holly Bilubi decided to part ways with Dragons Den star Peter Jones’ lifestyle brand business for <0xC2><0xA3>11 million, Peter Jones appeared ‘inconsistent’ on it.
Bilubi doesn't have time for her homewear and accessories brand Truely at all.
The business of these two was being compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This 37-year-old morning presenter announced her separation on Instagram.
Holly Bilubi distanced herself from her lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute with Dragons Den star Peter Jones - so that she can focus on her new best-of-contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources revealed that when TV’s Golden Girl admitted during a tense meeting at Jones’ business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that she was falling apart from her new deal – which is worth 1.5 million pounds – that Jones was upset over, meaning that Bilubi no longer had enough time to give her homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business was being compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and it was being considered to double the estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million offered by Willoughby.
The 37-year-old announced on Instagram that she was separating from True, after which Jones left the UK to go to a holiday home.
A source explained: "Holi was truly at the top of the priorities ever.
This was supposed to be his long-term future, which made this brand very much ahead in the next few decades.
His decision shocked everyone involved in this business.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to starting.
The warehouse at Marlow headquarters is full of goods that are to be sold."
Experts believe that the separation of the UK's richest star from the morning presenter could cost the firm millions of dollars because it has invested heavily in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewares, and it is likely to be delayed even before it starts.
It can also lead to a long friendship.
Bilubi's three children and husband Dan Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for the past ten years.
Willubi made his real-life debut with Cap in 2016 and was joined by 52-year-old Jones as chairman in March.
The couple and Jones have a 40 per cent stake in Baldwin's TV production firm.
Bilubi has now become the brand ambassador of M&S and will be replaced by Ant McPartlin to host I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
"We don't want to talk about their business case," said a source close to Jones last night.
"We've had a lot of discussions, and we've agreed."
He ridiculed the criticism, saying that the news media would continue to comment on him, that some would consider it "a different job from the presidency" and would be much more positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump done so much?
Trump told in his appearance "News Anchor" voice.
"I didn't sacrifice anyone."
He said Kim is interested in the second meeting after his first meeting in Singapore in June, a major step taken by Trump in the first meeting to make North Korea nuclear-free.
However, the nuclear-free negotiations were called off.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not waiting for a "consistent response" from the U.S. to North Korea's initial denuclearization moves.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues to press for sanctions to be maintained.
Trump's rally speech saw a much more optimistic view of him.
"We are engaged in building good relations with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to fight with North Korea.
In which millions of people were killed.
Now our relations have become very good.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - including completing a rocket test, helping to free the hostages and bringing the remaining U.S. troops home.
At the same time, he defended his unusual approach in negotiating relations with Kim.
Directly pointing to the crowd in front of him, Trump said, “It’s very easy to remain president, but 10,000 people from outside the country are trying to get into the area, we’ll have about 200 people to stop them.”
An island in Indonesia has been devastated by a tsunami and an earthquake, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed for the event.
Despite more than 10 percent of Lombok's population being devastated, no national disaster was declared, as well as a condition to provide international aid.
"In many situations, unfortunately, it was clear to them that they weren't asking for international help, so it became a bit more challenging," Ms Sumbu said.
Still, Save the Children teamed up with a team to visit Palu, but it is not yet clear whether employees from other countries can come to help.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials were taking stock of the situation in Palu and were looking at whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Given such situations that occur repeatedly in Indonesia, it seems that the country is not preparing at all for the outbreak of nature.
Although shelters have been built for people affected by the tsunami in Aachen, they are not like shelters on other beaches.
Palu has seen a decrease in warning sirens for tsunamis, no matter how harmful the warning may be, which is likely to lead to an increase in life damage.
Whether it is the best time to visit, it is challenging to get to the middle of many islands in Indonesia.
Managing employees and goods from natural disasters is always complicated.
The quake victims are being brought to a hospital in Lombok, which is far from Palu, and it takes at least three days to reach here from the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's very bad infrastructure an issue for his election campaign and he spent a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration was torn apart by a lack of funds as elections are due again next year.
Joko is also under pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have made religious ideology more conservative.
More than 1,000 people died and more than 10,000 were left homeless, as Christian and Muslim gangs fought each other on the streets using knives, bows and arrows and other dangerous weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge mysteriously equalled Chelsea by bending over
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute at London's Stamford Bridge on Saturday to keep Liverpool out of the Premier League.
Sturridge got a pass from Zerdan Shakiri from a distance of about 30 yards, at the time his team was trailing 1-0 by Chelsea goal.
He hit the ball with his left foot before making the Far Post shot.
His effort went towards the right top corner of the net with the height above the box.
Eventually the ball fell out of Kepa Arizabalaga's grip and went into the net.
“It was just an attempt to get to that position, to get in touch with the ball and to take it as far away from players like Shaw as possible, so I just tried to take as much time as possible for myself,” Sturges told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and touching once and didn't think too much about it and just hit the shot."
Chelsea were leading 1-0 in the halftime after Belgium's best player Aiden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
Before the ball reached near the midfield and Liverpool reached the half game, the Blues striker gave Matteo Kovac a pass in that game.
Kovacic delivered the ball very quickly in the midfield.
Then, they beautifully shot the ball, moving it into the hazard box.
Hazard got out of the defence and sent off from the net with a shot from the left leg behind Liverpool's Alison Baker.
Liverpool will now take on Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 pm on Wednesday in Stadio San Paolo, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 pm in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The country's disaster agency said Sunday morning that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that a 7.5-magnitude earthquake and a 20-feet-high tsunami that hit Friday were reported to have trapped many people in the wreckage.
The town of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, had several buildings collapsed, filling the city with debris.
Police detained a 32-year-old man, who is suspected to have stabbed a woman to death
An investigation into the murder was launched this morning after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman's body was found at 7.55 a.m. in John Street of Grayson Muse, with stabbing marks on her body, in reference to a 32-year-old man suspected of the act who was taken into custody.
The police questioned the people living in the area and tried to find out if anyone had seen or heard anything in this regard.

I would also like to appeal to those, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured anything on the dashcam footage to contact us because they may have information that is necessary for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed the woman whose body was recovered from the local area of Birkenhead and found inside a property.
This afternoon, the woman's acquaintances reached the spot and asked where her body was found this morning.
The police are investigating the matter and said they would soon inform the family of the deceased.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Muse is trying to empty his flat right now, but police have reported that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
When he came to know about the incident, he remained silent.
It is now being told to the people living nearby that it will take a few hours to get back to the old situation.
A police officer heard from a person that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the spot crying.
She kept saying over and over again that "it's terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans went inside the enclosure while another was standing outside the enclosure.
Several officers were standing inside the enclosure built for surveillance on the block of flats.
If a person has any information, he can tell the DM at <0x40>MerPolCC, or call 101, or contact anonymously at 0800 555 111 by referring to the log of 30 September 247.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament recently became the most famous monument, re-recorded in history
Its exile would be the ideal justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts created by his radical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "foolish" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the ongoing debate over the removal of the statues, there was a great deal of apprehension that the statue of Oliver Cromwell would be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
There was neither an order for the symbol of the English Civil War nor was it made by Cromwell.
It could be wrong that Cromwell would have sacrificed for the works of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
According to Sir William Hemo Thoracroft, Cromwell's finest representation is evidence of the idea of the 19th century and part of the history of a statue that many still admire.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is respected by many, perhaps for this reason most people still know him as a protector of Parliament standing against external pressures in the late 19th century monarchy.
Yet, they are considered to be absolutely accurate representatives, which has historically been a subject of debate.
It is obvious that our nation has been developing since the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, and the statue of Cromwell remains a personal identity that reflects one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are laudable and memorable.”
Deadly pig attacks Chinese farmer, killing farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked a farmer in a market in southwestern China, killing the farmer.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that only the man's nickname "Yuan" has been identified, his body was found with serious injuries, his body was found in a blood-soaked coffin near a pig-battle in the market of Lipansui in Guizhou province.
On May 30, 2005, a pig-breeding farmer in Xining, Qinhai Province, China, was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig-basket.
He reportedly came to the market on Wednesday with his cousin living in nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, her cousin died and it was found that a pig-fence door was open nearby.
He said that a very large male pig was seen in the boar with blood on its mouth.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds attacked the farmer and killed him.
According to Guyang Evening News, her cousin, nicknamed "Woo," said, "My cousin's legs were soaked in blood and completely injured."
Security camera footage showed Yuan coming to the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was recovered about an hour later.
The pig that attacked the person and killed him was not of Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was kept locked so that it could not attack a person, although police took stock of the scene and gathered evidence.
Yuan's family members and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
However, there have been rare cases of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016, a boar in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband on their farm, seriously wounding the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig attacked a Welsh farmer while he was on his tractor, attacking the farmer until his wife drove the animal away in fear.
In 2012 a farmer in Oregon was attacked by his pigs and killed by them and made his own food, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are generally not aggressive, but they can be "dangerous" when they get a taste of blood.
"They're just playing.
They bite through the teeth and are very exploratory... they are not meant to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remaining parts of Hurricane Rosa caused heavy rain in the southwestern U.S.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves to the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the ROSA will cause flooding in northern Mexico and southwestern America in the coming days.
Rosa recorded wind speeds of 85 mph at 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, a Category 1 storm, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving toward the west coast of the United States. Since Rosa is about to approach the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, much tropical moisture will begin to subside in the northern parts of the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will receive 10 inches of rain due to some parts of Mexico.
After that, the moisture coming from the trough in the coming days will combine with tropical moisture bringing heavy rainfall to the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, debris drifting and landslides in the desert.
Very high tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to be 2 to 3 inches in some places, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is likely to be 2 to 4 inches in most parts of the southwestern part, especially Arizona.
Due to the sporadic nature of tropical rainfall, there may be a lot of flooding with poor conditions.
In view of the risk of tropical rainfall, it will be advisable to stay out of the low-lying desert.
Due to heavy rains, the valleys can become riskier rivers and along with thunderstorms, strong winds and dust will blow in the local areas.
Due to the approaching trough, some parts of the Southern California coast will receive heavy rain locally.
The total rainfall is likely to be more than half an inch, which could lead to some sort of debris drift and cause slippery conditions on the roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the season in the region.
There will be some sporadic tropical rains in Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning before the rain becomes more widespread on Monday and Tuesday evening.
There will be heavy rain in the four corners on Tuesday and it will continue till Wednesday.
Temperatures may change rapidly throughout the U.S. in October as the Arctic weather cools down, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes there are strange changes in temperature due to this short distance.
The unusual change in temperatures in the Central U.S. on Sunday is a great example of this.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is about 20 degrees.
In the next few days, due to the heat, the weather will start getting hot and the heat will increase.
Weather is expected to warm in most parts of the central and eastern U.S. from October, which could range from the southern plains to some areas in the northeast in the mid 80s.
On Tuesday, the temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees, which will be about 10 degrees higher than the average temperature.
According to our long-term climate forecast, we are indicating that in the first six months of October, there are plenty of opportunities for the eastern U.S. to stay above the average temperature.
More than 20 million people have heard of Brett Kavanaugh.
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched the Supreme Court trial of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who has accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse, allegedly carried out in the 1980s, the woman's name is Christine Blasey Ford, the hearing was shown on six television channels.
Meanwhile, political deadlocks were also seen, with broadcasters halting Friday’s regular program of Last-Minute Twist: An Agreement Engineered by Arizona Sen. The lawsuit was filed after the FBI’s Jeff Flake investigated the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was "absolutely sure" that Cavanaugh at a high school party had drugged him and tried to strip him of his clothes.
Kavanaugh defended himself, saying he was absolutely sure it didn't happen at all.
More than 20.4 million people are expected to see the Nielsen report on Friday.
The company was counting average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Statistics for PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, as well as other channels showing it, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty calculating the people who visit the offices.
From this point of view, it is equal to the number of spectators in a playoff football game or academy award.
Nielsen reported that the Fox News channel, which the thought-provoking host has overwhelmingly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was ahead of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearings.
The number of viewers on ABC was 3.26 million and it came in second place.
There were 3.1 million viewers on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 2.89 million on MSNBC and 2.52 million on CNN, Nielsen reported.
There was a lot of interest in the audience.
Fleck was the central figure in the drama that took place on Friday.
The liberal Republican office issued a statement after the term, saying they would raise their voice on behalf of Kavanaugh, who appeared in front of the cameras of CNN and CBS on Friday morning, when protesters were shouting to oppose the hearing of the judicial committee.
When he was being abused, at that time he stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes, it was seen live on CNN.
One woman said, "Take it, I'm standing right here in front of you."
“Do you think they are telling the right thing to the country?”
They were asked, "Have you been brought to power to make a lot of women powerless?"
Flake said a statement was issued by his office before the elevator was shut down and that he would be able to give his full statement at the committee hearing.
While the Judiciary Committee was pushing Kavanaugh's nomination for the vote to the entire Senate, cable and broadcast channels were still showing everything live several hours later.
But Flake said he would do so with the full understanding that the FBI would look into the allegations next week against the nominees, which are being urged by the minority Democrats.
Fleck talked about this with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After negotiating with Coons and several senators, Fleck made his decision.
Flake liked power because it was clear that allowing the Kavanaugh without investigation would not allow Republicans to vote.
US President Donald Trump has approved an FBI investigation into the allegations.
"British Prime Minister May accused critics of doing ""politics"" over Brexit."
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May asked critics to stop playing politics with Britain's future by making it a "game" in the European Union and to focus all their attention on the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is likely to attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
Just next to her interview on the front page of the newspaper, an interview with her former Secretary of State Boris Johnson was published in which Boris Johnson tried to suppress the attack on him because of the so-called Checkers Plan of Brexit, his statement that Britain and the EU should keep pace with each other is "completely meaningless."
Mad Sims shot at: Police detain a suspected man for the death of the LSU player
Police detained a suspect for shooting and killing a man on the Crazy Sims, the 20-year-old Wade was a LSU basketball player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said that 20-year-old Dayton Simpson has been detained and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder.
The video of the encounter between Sims and Simpson was released by authorities, and police reported that Sims' glasses were lost at the time of the encounter.
The police have recovered the glasses from the spot and said that according to the WAFB report related to CBS, it was found that the DNA is of Simpson.
Police questioned Simpson and said he fatally opened fire to kill Maddy.
The lawyer's report said that for this, he has been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office released a preliminary report on Friday, which said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police's Fugutive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police, and those in the area who cooperate with the investigation for detention.
The LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the law in force in the area for its "hard work and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 6 feet 6 inches tall, he grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He received 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade reported that Wade's death has made the team "scattered" and "very sad."
"Who will replace him now will always be a concern," Wade said.
Volcanic ash found in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has been found in the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano and reported that 183 gas and ash discharges had been recorded in 24 hours.
The center was monitored on several tremors and pulsations.
Photos posted on social media showed thin layers of ash coating car windshields visible in the neighborhood of a Mexico city such as Exochimilco.
In September 2017, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit Central Mexico, since then geophysicists have noted the rising activity of the volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the Capitol.
The volcano "Don Goo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on Independence Vote Anniversary
Six people from Barcelona were detained after clashes with riot police on Saturday, and thousands of rivals joined protests on the first anniversary of Catalonia's independence.
A group of masked pro-separatists threw eggs and powder paint on riot police, making the road dark, causing inconvenience to commuters.
Police used batons and batons to control the clash.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "no forget, no apologies", while federal protesters chanted "Spain remains immortal".
According to the local press report, fourteen people who were injured due to the demonstration were treated.
According to Madrid, the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal, has been escalating tensions in areas with independent views for a year, but Catalan separatists have been celebrating it.
Voters opted for independence in a great way, though there were fewer people who overwhelmingly opposed segregation.
Catalonian officials said about 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop people from moving to polling stations in the area amid clashes.
Groups supporting independence stayed overnight on Friday to help the National Police to stop the protests.
The demonstration was carried forward, but she was forced to take a different decision.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcissus Terminus, who arrived with his wife to take part in the separatist protests, said he saw no prospect of Catalonia becoming independent.
"We had our best year last year.
I saw my parents cheering by voting, but it seems like we're now stuck," he said.
Despite a small victory in regional elections in December last year, Catalonia's pro-independence parties struggled this year with many of their famous leaders to maintain influence, whether it was in exposing themselves or in waiting for the referendum to be blocked for their role in organizing and continuing to declare independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on her phone to help police, said the clash between politicians on both sides had been prevented.
"It's been very stressful," she said.
On Saturday, Orol Junqueres, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trail jail since the end of last year, announced that they would fight in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Fighting European elections as a candidate is the best way to return to democratic values and condemn the return we have seen in the government of Spain," he said.
LondonDerry: Man arrested for car attack at home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested for repeatedly attacking a Londonderry home with a car.

Deputy inspector Bob Blamings said the doors and buildings of the house were damaged.
In some places the crossbow may have been attacked by a car.
Menga beat Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal ensured Livingston's victory
According to the manager of the Ibrox club, the fast-moving Livingston surprised the Rangers, so Steven Gerrard only had to take responsibility for his second defeat in 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's strike made the difference that was equaled by Gary Holt's side move with Hibernian in the second half of the match.
Gerrard's side stayed one step away from winning this season's premiership and will face the leaders Hearts who are eight points behind next Sunday.
Earlier, on Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston has been consistently winning in the six-game division by bringing in head coach Holt in place of Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed out on showing off his game to the visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead long before scoring, plus, their great game caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson broke the record, but trailed by an effort to score, then Alan Lithgow was able to keep his best effort straight after slipping to complete the goal in Craig Lightweight's header.
The hosts got a chance to play against the Rangers, they knew they could put the visitors in trouble on the set piece.
And that's how he got the important goal.
The Rangers got a free-kick and Livingston opened, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson working to set up the Menga, which took a touch and scored from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had strengthened their position, but missed home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was left largely behind,
This pattern continued into the second half as well, although Alfredo Morelos insisted on Kelly being a save.
Scott Pitman's shot was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor from the legs and Lithgow fully captured the game by flicking from the second livingston.
In the Livingston box, the crosses continued to come and go until the goal was scored, while the lightweight challenge was followed by two penalty claims, one on bringing Glenn Middleton and the other on handball.
Analysis of Livingston's 'extraordinary goal'
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont joins Tony McCaroni Arena
The extraordinary performance and results of Livingston.
For any individual, they were excellent, they have continued to raise expectations on this growing trajectory.
His style of play and personality have changed dramatically since his return from top flight, but the most credit goes to Holt's manner in which he has given the team a new look since his arrival.
There were a lot of good players.
Captain lightweight was the best player, he saved brilliantly, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warl behind him.
However, there was a lack of learning in Rangers.
The kind of good performance he has done under Gerard many times, he was less than his standard.
They lacked the final ball - they were only able to cut towards their home side open once - and it was like some wake-up call for the Rangers, who kept themselves in the mid-table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an was given a warm welcome in Cologne.
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday, smiles were scattered but to no avail.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations with NATO allies.
He has been embroiled in controversy over a range of issues, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After that, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an spoke on the construction of a very large new mosque in Cologne.
Outside of Turkey, the city is one of the most populated areas in Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, citing security reasons, but many supporters flocked to nearby places to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters protesting Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an - some of whom were Kurdish - also raised slogans, condemning Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Two-way protests saw a divide between those who welcomed the visitor, some of whom regarded him as a German Turk hero and others insulted him by calling him a voluntary ruler.
Road accident in Depford: cyclist dies after being hit by a car
In London, a cyclist died after being hit by a car.
The accident occurred at about 10:15 BST in the south-eastern area of the city, near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a bustling street in Deptford.
The driver of the car stopped the car and took first aid, but the man died on the spot.
Another cyclist died a few months ago due to a hit-and-run at Children's Street, about a mile away from the crash site.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and inform his family members.
Due to the diversion of the road and diversion of the bus, such incidents are taking place and motorists have been advised to avoid going to such areas.
Long Lartin Jail: Six officers injured due to disturbance
The jail office said that six jail officials were injured due to disturbances in the jails of high-security men.
Something went wrong at the HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still going on.
The specialist "Tornado" authorities have been called to fix the disturbance, this disturbance is in a wing in which eight prisoners are kept.
There were minor injuries on the face of rights at the spot which were treated.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to repair the accident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our jails at all, and it is obvious that those responsible for the violence will be sent to the police and they may be imprisoned.”
More than 500 prisoners are in HMP Long Lartin, some of them the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor was attacked by a prisoner, after which the prison governor was treated in a hospital.
In addition, riot officials were called to the jail in October last year to fix a serious dislocation, during which an employee was attacked with a pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Dried areas can benefit)
The danger in tropical areas remains after Hurricane Rosa hit Arizona, but it is very likely that this is the same one that could affect the remaining capacity of the storm in the coming week to the Desert Southwest, which poses a high risk of flooding.
On Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service had already announced that cities in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, as well as southern and eastern Nevada in western Arizona, southeastern California and Utah, were expected to experience severe flooding.
The rain on Monday evening is expected to leave Rosa directly through Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service, based in Phoenix, tweeted, “Ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have sustained tropical storms or depressions since 1950!”
Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the hurricane AZ border."
The recent National Hurricane Center model has predicted that Arizona’s Mogolon rim could receive up to 2 to 4 inches of rain, as well as up to 6 inches of it.
Central Rockies and the Great Basin, as well as other areas of Desert Southwest, are likely to receive up to 1 to 2 inches of rain, as well as up to 4 inches of it.
Outside areas at high flood risk, Rosa's rain may prove to be a blessing as the area is dry.
Although the floods remain a serious concern, there is still a drought situation in the Southwest, which is likely to benefit greatly from the rains.
According to the U.S.Drawout Monitor, only 40 percent of Arizona is too dry, this is the second-highest category of drought," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.
The maximum wind speed of Hurricane Rosa was 85 mph on Sunday morning, at that time it was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and it is now moving northwards at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
This storm is currently in the cold water of the Pacific region, due to which its power is decreasing.
Thus, it is expected that the power of the tropical storm may cause landslide conditions in Mexico in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Heavy rain is likely in some areas of Mexico, which could increase the risk of flooding.
According to a report by “weather.com”, “it is expected to rain from Baja California to northwestern Sonora by 3 to 6 inches, as well as, it is likely to be 10 inches.”
After that, Rosa became a tropical storm and will move across Mexico before reaching the Arizona border in the north on Tuesday morning, after which it will move southwards into Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The highest risk from Rosa or its remnants is in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest, where heavy rain is likely,” the National Hurricane Center reported.
It is estimated that these rains are likely to cause severe floods in the deserts and landslides in the hilly areas.
Attack in Midsummer Norton: Four people detained for conspiracy to murder
A 16-year-old minor in Somerset was found to be in an injured condition, attacked with a knife for which three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been detained in a conspiracy to murder.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital for treatment where his condition is stated to be "well."
Avon and Somerset police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were detained from the Redstock area overnight.
Officials have also appealed to people to contact them if they have any mobile phone footage of the incident.
Trump calls Kavanaugh's problem 'Democratic Party's anger'
At a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, Trump pointed out, “Justice Kavanaugh is a man who has been rejected by the Democratic Party’s ruthless and abusive tactics.”
Trump says the trouble Kavanaugh is going through is the result of the Democratic Party's anger during his nomination process.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh cleared Congress of what Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexually assaulting Ford several decades ago as a teenager, while giving the cleanup a stark and emotional rebuttal.
Ford also gave his testimony about the allegations during the hearing.
On Saturday, the President said, “The American people saw the quality and courage of Kavanaugh to be the best human being that day.”
Speaking to a crowd of supporters in West Virginia, he said, "Voting Justice Kavanaugh means voting for a man who is the most accomplished jurist of our time, he can confirm the law and do justice with the real record of public service."
Talking about the importance of Republican votes in the midterm elections, the President referred to Kavanaugh's nomination.
"There are only five weeks left, from the election that is the most important in our lives.
I am not involved in it, but in reality I am involved," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for all the candidates who are really worthy."
Trump said Democrats are on a campaign to "oppose and block."
A senior GOP aide told CNN that the Senate's first counting of Kavanaugh's nomination is set to begin on Friday.
Indonesia earthquake, tsunami: Death toll rises to 10
When a huge earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday, high-altitude waves began to rise in the sea and at least 384 people died, officials said.
On Friday, a festival was being celebrated on the beach of Palu city in which hundreds of people gathered, after the evening when waves of six meters (18 feet) were raised, it had caused havoc, due to which many people died and everything around them was also destroyed.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“Yesterday, when the tsunami was at risk, people in the middle were engaged in their activities and were not in a position to leave immediately and got trapped,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB in Breifeng in Jakarta.
Nugroho said, "The tsunami not only caused the deaths of people, but it also dragged cars, logs and houses to the ground, wrapping them up. Before attacking the beach, the tsunami traveled at a speed of 800 km per hour (497 mph) over the open sea.
Some people climbed trees to save themselves from the tsunami, he said.
16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centres in Palu.
Photos posted by the disaster agency from the plane showed several buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges turned and collapsed and a mosque was also surrounded by water.
The subsequent tremors continued on the rocks in the coastal city on Saturday.
2.4 million people in the area experienced a persistent earthquake.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It pointed out that the geography of the city, settled at the end of a long, narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho elaborated on the damage, saying it was "very terrible" and caused thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels to collapse.
He said the bodies of some people were trapped in the debris of the collapsed buildings and 540 people were injured while 29 people were yet to be identified.
The damage and loss of life is likely to be much higher in the Dongla area, 300 kilometres (190 miles) north of Palu, near the epicentre, Nugroho said.
Nugroho reported that the communication system in Dongla was "completely damaged."
In a statement, the Red Cross said more than 300,000 people were staying and its staff and volunteers were visiting the affected areas.
“It’s a tragic event in the past, but it can be even more terrible,” it said.
On Saturday, the agency criticised why the tsunami was not reported earlier if it was about to hit Palu, though officials said the warning was about to be issued but the waves had already gone.
An amateur made some videos and posted on social media by a man who could be seen standing on the upper floor of the building with a man screaming on the street below and can be heard a frightening warning.
Within a few minutes, too much water started coming out of the middle and also dragged buildings and cars with them.
Reuters was not able to verify the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages in Palu and cut communication lines, making it difficult for authorities to link rescue efforts together.
Taking help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities have begun sending cargo planes, officials said, adding that there is still a need to evacuate people and meet other requirements, including food.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will close in October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
Its very scary.
Doseba said that the World Vision staff at Donggla made every effort to make Palu city safe, the employees are living in the tarpaulin shelters in the courtyard of their office, they have seen the devastation with their own eyes.
“Talking to them, they found that they saw many houses being destroyed,” he said.
Its very scary.
While the relief groups started taking up the task of bringing relief material seriously, some complained that external aid workers with specialised expertise were not being allowed to come to Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, money, goods and staff from abroad can only be taken if a disaster zone is declared as a national disaster zone.
But that has not been done so far.
"The disaster is still at the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, a Red Cross spokesman based in Indonesia.
“After the government said it was okay, this is a national disaster, only then can we include international aid personnel in the rescue work but this has not happened yet.”
Even after the second night of Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members in Palu, whose whereabouts were not known, had hoped that their loved ones would be miraculously found as they did after natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was found trapped in a sewer.
Rescuers pulled out a woman from the rubble on Sunday and found her baby lying in the rubble for two days.
The coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, Gandan Subando, trained two paragliders of the Asian Games to locate the missing people, who had been dedicated to it since the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, along with his students, was among those stranded at the Roa Roa Hotel.
“As a senior in the paragliding field, I am also emotionally suppressed,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that the Paragliding community started their work after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, they had sent messages via WhatsApp to the Palu competitors participating in the Beach Festival.
However, only gray marks are visible on his message, do not show blue marks on it.
"I think that means the messages couldn't reach people," he said.
Thieves loot $26,750 at ATMs in Levi's Newport
According to a news release issued by the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning, an employee of Brink was pouring money into an ATM located in Levi's Newport, in the meantime the thieves stole $26,750.
Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report that the driver of the car was vacating an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to pour more money.
While he was busy with his work, "someone ran from behind the Brink's employee" came and ran away with the bag of money kept for putting.
According to the report, many people present at the spot are suspected, but the police are yet to ascertain the total number of people present at the spot.
Anyone who has information related to their identity should call the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper has changed his name to
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name to this.
He tweeted on Saturday about the change, tweeting: "Formally his name will be Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has kept his name for a while and will use the name for the title moniker of his eighth album released in June.
This change is being made in his presence at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to debut his new album Yandy.
The producer of the show revealed that he has removed singer Ariana Grande from the show who had refused to join the show due to "emotional reasons."
Along with shortening his existing professional name, West had already stated that the term has religious significance for him.
Speaking on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy earlier this year, West said, “I believe the word ‘yeh’ has been used many times in the Bible, and according to the Bible it means ‘you’.”
“So I am you, I am we, this is us.
This word is derived from Kanye, which means the only one, which is just this - it represents our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is about who we are.
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs also has many names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has kept his name Love and Brother Love while announcing for the name.
An old friend of the West, Jay-Z, also changed his name with or without hyphens and big letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed that the military force will never be used for civilian purposes.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador on Saturday at Teltelco Plaza promised that “military force will never be used to put pressure on the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful protest in Plaza, killing more than 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were spreading throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has promised to support Mexico’s youth, grant students every month, and open more and more free government universities.
He said that due to unemployment and less opportunities to get education, youth become involved in crime.
U.S. should double funding for AI
Kai-Fu Li, a reduced investor and AI practitioner for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said, "As China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of money spent on research in this area."
The AI made the comment after several actions by the U.S. government, adding that the U.S. lacks an overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China launched a plan: it aims to reach No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget will give a great start, taking a look at all the other countries, so the U.S. is far behind in this matter, and we’re making efforts for AI’s next success,” Lee explained.
“Doubling the fund could double the likelihood that AI’s next major achievement will be in the U.S,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, is an investor in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, one of China's best AI companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that left behind the highest-ranking American Othello player, and later he was appointed executive at Microsoft Research and president at Google's China branch.
Lee improved the technical capabilities of the previous U.S. government, including the robot-related challenges of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and said he would be the next government that would recognize the next visionary.
Lee pointed out that researchers in the U.S. often face a lot of difficulties in getting government help.
“It’s not China removing academic leaders, it’s corporate,” Li pointed out.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired giants from the university to work on AI.
Lee said that by changing the immigration policy, the U.S. can help its AI efforts.
"According to me, the permission to do a PhD in AI through a green card should automatically be obtained," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
"The National Natural Science Foundation of China gives financial grants to researchers from the National Science Foundation and other government organizations in the U.S. in the same way that the people of the Academic Institute are funded, but the quality of teaching work in China is not very good," Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense opened a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center that aims to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month, DARPA launched an initiative called AI Next that talked about investing $2 billion.
For NSF, right now this investment is more than $100 million per year in AI research.
In the meantime, legislation was enacted in the U.S. that the demand for creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence would be ignored for months.
Macedonians voted to change the country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a work that would resolve the decades-old dispute with Greece that led Greece to block its membership bids in the European Union and NATO.
Greece also has a province named Macedonia, saying its northern neighbor is named after its territory, which has two names for a single bid and is already in NATO and the European Union.
The two governments struck a deal in June based on the new name suggested, but nationalist opponents opposed it and said the renaming of Macedonia would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority people living in Slavic.
President Georg Ivanov said he would not go to the referendum and boycott the campaign, raising doubts that a minimum of 50 percent of the vote needed for the vote would be valid.
The question would be written on the voting ballot: “Do you give your approval for the agreement with Greece for membership of NATO and the EU?”
Supporters of the name change, along with Prime Minister Zoran Zev, say it is important for Macedonia to become a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries that have emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, this future is for young people in Macedonia, it will allow them to live freely under the EU umbrella because it means a safe life for all of us,” said Oliviera Georgijevska, 79, who lives in Skopje.
Although not legally pushing for it, most members of parliament say they will work according to the results of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority is required for a name change in the Parliament.
According to the State Election Commission, there were no reports of irregularities till 1 pm.
However, when the last parliamentary elections were held in 2016, the turnout was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent, with 66 per cent of registered voters voting.
“I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gojo Tanevsky, a 62-year-old voter living in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zeev, along with his wife Zorika and his son Dushko, cast their vote in Macedonia for a change in the country's name, so that the country's name will join NATO and the European Union in Stromica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, who lives in Skopje, was preparing a small stage in front of parliament and placing chairs in front of the tents of those who were protesting the vote.
“We definitely want NATO and EU membership, but we want to join it by raising our heads, not through an agreement,” Kavdarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we also have our own self-respect.
If they don’t want to give us membership in the name of Macedonia, no matter what, we can join other countries like China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asia integration.”
Prime Minister Zev has said that membership in NATO will provide much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
After casting his vote, Zeve said, "I think a lot of the votes will be positive because more than 80 percent of our citizens agree to join the EU and NATO."
He explained that the "yes" result would "confirm our future."
The survey, published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research, showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the required voting.
A second survey conducted by Telema TV in Macedonia on Sunday showed that 57 percent of people were planning to vote.
Of those, 70 percent agreed to vote yes.
More than 50 percent of the vote is needed to be successful.
If the vote fails, the Western government's policy, which was set to take effect in May last year, will be the first serious setback.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero forced the whole Brighton to defend to score
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling had a 2-0 win over Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester City, England.
Ironically, Aguero scored his easy goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker was given a pass in the midfield early on.
As soon as he landed in the open field, he got three Brighton players to defend.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four opposition players.
He pushed a player defending before moving forward from the corner of the Brighton box.
Then, finding Sterling, he sent a pass to his left.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, Aguero beat Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan using his left boot, and the ball went into the net from his right.
“Aguero has had some problems with his legs that bother him,” city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked for 55, 60 minutes on their game.
Thats what happened.
We were lucky that they scored at the same time."
But, it was because of Sterling that brought the Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League encounter.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In that game, Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's area.
He pulled the ball beautifully from Leroy Sen's left side.
Sen did a couple of touchdowns before sending Sterling away playing well.
The Sky Blues tapped the ball forward just before the game slipped by hand.
The Champions League group play will now take place at 12:55 pm on Tuesday against Hoffenheim in Sinsim, Germany.
Shaffer wants to beat him by playing against the Rockies.
After the playoff feud with the Nationals ended, there was no major reason to push for another start.
But, the always-competing Scager is hoping to make big scores against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but the playoffs for the Rockies still remain the only possibility, having won the game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies gained a wild-card spot by winning the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, but they are still looking to get the first division title.
"Even though we're not playing very well, we can at least play to know that Denver's environment with crowds and other teams will probably be for the highest level game I'll face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate in that game?"
The Nationals still have to tell about the starter for Sunday, but there are rumors that the shaker could be included in such a situation.
Shaezer, who played for his 34th start, took the risk of a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch at his normal on Sunday.
Washington's right hander finished 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 innings of this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
Talking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm election, the President referred to Brett Kavanaugh as referring to the situation around his Supreme Court.
"All the work we've done will be at stake in November.
There are only five weeks left for the most important election of our lives.
"It's a big election - I'm not involved, but I'm really involved, because I'm fighting for all the great candidates," he said.
"You can look at this very, very, very terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see everything that's happening right now," Trump said.
Moreover, they are trying to grab power by using other essential means, which you know is futile and useless.
To get power and control, they don’t care who is sad, who is capable of it, they just want power and control, but we won’t let that happen.”
The Democrat's campaign, he said, is "opposition and obstruction."
“Also, you can see what has happened in the last four days, you saw the anger of the Democrats and you also saw how mean and bad they are,” he said.
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee as Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein, who was strongly appreciated by the audience.
"Remember his answer?"
Did you get rid of the document?
What.
No, no, I'm waiting for something - one whose body language was really bad - to see such a bad body language for the first time."
Working is no longer a broad church.
It is not acceptable for those who speak their mind
When the activists pushing my local party voted to elect me, it was a huge surprise to me.
After all, I am the newest among the Labour MPs whose importance is far less - we cannot say all that we have in mind.
This is what happened to my MP colleague, Joan Ryan, because she too had raised her voice for anti-socialism.
In my case, Sensor Motion condemned me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, Europe had logistically similar problems on which Jeremy disagreed with senior leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Meeting said on Friday that "we wish that all things should be included in the meeting and that it is beneficial."
During my eight years as a local Labour MP, most of what I saw here was the Friday Night GC meeting.
Sadly, many meetings today do not agree and or promise that the politics of “kind and gentle people” are really forgotten, happened here too.
It is obvious that in the Labour Party, if the views are different, they are not tolerated and for every consideration it is decided whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This is where it all started immediately after Jeremy became leader, the colleagues I had already thought of having political opinions like mine, began to expect me to turn my back on what I said and work in positions I could never agree with – whether it was on national security or the EU’s single market.
Whenever I raise my voice for the public — and it really doesn’t matter what I said — there are bad words on social media, there are sharp comments on it, center politics is condemned and I’m told I don’t deserve a Labour party.
Besides, it’s not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because my comments are political.
I know the way businesses work and am dedicated to colleagues who always face sexual or racial abuse, but don’t hold back from raising their voice.
In today’s political era, there are many frustrating aspects, one of which is how to normalize the levels of abuse.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that it was important for the Labour Party to promote a culture of intolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad church and every proposal of "no-confidence" or change in the party's selection rule has been greatly reduced.
Over the past two years, many people have advised me and urged me to keep quiet, not talk too much, and then "I'll be right."
But I didn’t come into politics for that.
32 years ago, when I was engaged in labor as a school student, I was instigated to oppose the Thatcher government, I was told to give up my school-wide class altogether, I demanded better public services for those who needed them the most – be it as local councillors or as government ministers.
I have never hidden any of my politics, including the politics in the last election.
There is no one in Nottingham East who has any doubt about my policy position and any area that disagrees with my current leadership.
To all those who promoted the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that as the country moves towards a Brexit that will damage homes, businesses and our public services, I do not consider it necessary for the Labour Party to waste my time and energy in showing its integrity.
But, actually, I have a message that is not for Nottingham Momentum, it’s for my supporters, whether they’re Labour members or not: I’m proud that I’m serving you and I promise that my work can’t create any kind of unselective risk or political campaign barrier, I’m only interested in things that are in everyone’s interest.

Iron 38 – 17 Melrose: Undefeated Iron Reaches the Top
The two late attempts may have some bearing on the final result, but there's no doubt that Iyer deserved to win in this great entertaining match of Tennant's premiership.
Now they are at the top of the table of just ten undefeated sides.
In the end, his defence was excellent, he found the best opportunities he could, which gave him the opportunity to take the home team forward and make coach Peter Murchi happy.
“We thoroughly investigated our game and we’re still undefeated, so it makes me happy,” he explained.
Robin Christie of Melrose reported: “The credit for this goes to Iyer, who capitalized on his opportunity as much as possible.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute effort put Frazier Climo in front of Ayres, but Varriers gave a yellow card to Scotland's Rory Hughes for the game, which gave Melrose a chance to score and Jason Bagen capitalized on a very difficult effort.
With the help of the penalty just before half-time, Klimo extended the Ayre, scoring the goal and then tried to unify the match 17-5 for the Ayre at break time.
But Melrose was better in the second half and Patrick Anderson's effort was converted into a goal by Baggot, reducing Levy's five points.
After that, Ruridih Knott suffered a serious injury that caused the game to stop for a long time, he was stretched, then after the start of the game, Ayre went ahead and tried through Stafford McDowall, which Clemo converted to goal.
At that time, Iyer's team captain, Blair McPherson, received a yellow card, and then due to too much pressure at the end of the game, Melrose gave an attempt to extra man Bruce Colvin, who failed to capitalize on it.
However, the hosts were left behind and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card after facing Billa Ball's Clemo from the penalty line-out, McPherson took the touchdown by pushing the Iyer from behind.
After gathering David Armstrong's box kick by Kelly Rowe and sending Flanker Gregor Henry away for a fifth attempt on the home side, Clemo converted it into a goal, as they could when the game resumed.
The star of the game is still looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
Game star Ford Kieran is still exploring ways to get into the hospitality industry, with some time ago it was revealed that he was selected for a director of a licensed restaurant company.
Jack, 56, is associated with Jarvis' famous BBC show, in which he writes and has long supported comedy partner Greg Hemphy in his acting career.
The two have revealed that the upcoming ninth series will be their last in the show world, and it appears that Kiernan is planning what to do after Craiglang.
Based on the official record list, he is the director of AdriftMorn Ltd.
The actor declined to comment on the story, yet a Scottish Sun source pointed out that Kiernan wanted to join a "great restaurant trade" based in Glasgow.
‘We have a right to the sea’: Land-restricted Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way for the Pacific
Military-navies are patrolling extensively at the Naval Headquarters in La Paz.
Ocean-blue flags are being hoisted on government buildings.
Here is a slogan of the naval base stretching from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon: “We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to get it back."
Bolivia, which lost to Chile in the terrible struggle for land in the 19th century, is still desperate to get its land - they once again want to wave their flag in the Pacific Ocean.
He now has this latter hope of regaining his Bolivian land decades ago, as it awaits a decision from an International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia now has a lot of enthusiasm, a sense of unity and peace, and the hopes of the people here are going to have a positive outcome," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Callajila.
Many Bolivians, who will see the ICJ's big decision on the big screen across the country, have high hopes that the decision that will come from the Hague court will be in favor of Bolivia - which has been in negotiations for decades - forcing Chile to return Bolivia's land to the sea through negotiations.
Bolivia's best-known President Evo Morales - who is set to face a controversial contest in next year's re-election - also expressed his optimism in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to getting the Pacific Ocean back," he said last August.
But some analysts believe that the court's decision will not be in Bolivia's interest - and even if the decision is in its interest, there will be a lot of conditions.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the authority to reward the Chilean province, and it has decided that the possible outcome of the talks will not be determined.
Chilean expert Paz Z<0xC3><0xA9>r<0xC3><0xA9>t told the International Court of Justice that the ICJ's decision is set to come six months after the final talks, in which what was heard indicated that the case was "not complicated."
Also, aside from the conditions in Bolivia, for the past four years it seems that it may be back to the old position again.
"The issue of access to the sea has been blocked by the current government of Bolivia," Jarrett told the BBC.
He suggested that Morales' controversial statement ended Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate on certain conditions, but this time it will be very difficult to negotiate once the decision is made.
Since 1962, the ambassadors of the two countries have not lived in each other's country.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, who is in The Hague, has denied that the court's decision was unusually high speed.
He said Monday would be a "great opportunity" for Bolivia to "open new avenues for new relations with Chile" and "end 139 years of disagreements on mutual benefit."
Callazila has denied that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - was politicizing the maritime problem.
"Bolivia will never retreat for its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he said.
“The decision is a chance to let go of what we needed to do in the past.”
North Korea has said it will not stop its nuclear tests until it has confidence in the US.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that his country will not destroy its nuclear bomb unless it trusts Washington.
On Saturday, Ri gave a speech at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to fulfil the promises made during the summit between the leaders of other countries in Singapore.
He commented that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo looks like he's about to resume nuclear diplomacy after more than three months of North Korea's Kim Jong-un's promises in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "pipe dream" that would lead to sanctions and US objections to the declaration of an end to the Korean War.
Washington is wary of the consensus of an important disarmament campaign already underway without Pyongyang's announcement.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump wish there to be another summit.
But, it is entirely sceptical that Pyongyang is serious about dismantling the inspection of the nuclear bomb because they do not want to risk the security of the country.
Pompeo is planning to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit of both Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion show showed a variety of new design headwear for your nearest high street
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely protect your head from sunlight, then there is no need to wait any longer.
Both Valentino and Thom Brown designers have created a series of great headwear for their SS19 collection on the runway that appeared at the famous Paris Fashion Week in particular style.
The best benefic hats have been made to avoid this year's heat and these designers have sent their beautiful creations to show off on the show.
The best hats made by Valentino were quite large, decorated with a wide winged brim that hung around the model's head.
The second accessory with a much larger side included bezel-designed waterlamp hats, wizard hats, and pineapple-designed hats - but they're not designed to protect your head from frost.
Thom Brown also showed masks with special designs - and they can only be used in time for Halloween.
People were surprised to see many colorful masks, and things like the Hannibal Lector were seen more than the Haute Couture.
One creation saw all kinds of goods for scuba diving, including snowballs and glasses, while the other creation saw a design with a melting ice cream cone.
Also, if you've seen a bigger fashion - you're lucky.
Style-seeing enthusiasts estimate that this great collection can soon reach the fine shops around you.
The very large-sized La Bomba will be equipped with a design heel, a two-foot-wide-brim straw hat that will be available to everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Behind the best-influenced hat was a cult label that looked pretty, with a second creation catwalk posted on social media - featuring a model wearing a swimsuit on a straw beach bag.
The Bernt Orange Rafia bag was trimmed with Rafia Fringinge and fitted with a white leather handle, it was the best attraction of Jacquimus' La Rivera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Fashion celebrity Luke Armitage told FEMA: “I hope big hats and beach bags will arrive in stores soon for the coming summer season – because designers have been so impressed by this that it will be hard to ignore the demand for big-sized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for citizens of foreign countries
Scotland’s private schools keep track of the best education records, and since 2018 it has continued to deliver excellent test results, strengthening individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland affiliated with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), these schools are striving to provide the best possible service to their students and parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare their students for better and higher education, their chosen careers and places are benefiting the citizens of foreign countries.
As an education sector that can build and implement school curricula, we continue to see schools choose modern languages as a choice of popular and desired subjects.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you become great at it.”
If you talk to him in his own language, that speaks to his heart.”
When we want to build a relationship and trust people in other countries, we feel that we can rely more on English.
In this year's exam results, we can see that the languages with the highest passing rates in private schools are at the top of the league table.
68 per cent of them are students who have obtained the highest grade A in foreign languages.
As can be seen in the data collected by the 74 member schools of the SCIS, 72 per cent of the students achieved the highest grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of the students achieved the highest grade A in German, 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish.
This shows that Scotland’s private schools are collaborating in foreign languages, giving children and young people the skills they will need in the future.
Languages are now taking up courses in private schools as an optional subject and, among other things, STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that employers struggled to hire employees in vacant positions, with 17 percent of candidates lacking language skills.
Therefore, it is becoming imperative for young people to have more and more language skills to prepare them for their future careers.
These skills are essential for working anywhere in the world because of the high potential employment opportunities that language needs.
No matter what career option is chosen, if people have learned a second language, then such skills will definitely benefit them in the future.
If you are able to talk directly to foreigners, being a multilingual person will automatically get you ahead in the competition.
In 2013, more than 4,000 adults in the UK participated in the YouGov survey, according to which 75% of people were not able to speak enough in a foreign language, and only French was the subject that 15% could speak, and it was the only language to reach double-digit percentage.
This is the reason why it has become necessary to invest in teaching language to children today.
Having knowledge of many languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will enable children to have better opportunities to find the right jobs.
The languages taught in every school in Scotland will be different.
There are also many schools that will focus on more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that have a 2020 outlook and are considered most important for the UK, for example, Mandarin or Japanese.
Whether your child is interested in learning any language, they will always be able to choose that language in private schools and will also find staff teaching it to them who are experts in this field.
Scotland’s private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children for the future and give them the skills they need for success to thrive in the future.
For the global business environment, it cannot be ruled out that learning languages in the country is very important for the future, so it should be given a better place in education.
In fact, modern languages really should be accepted as “international communication skills.”
Young people in Scotland will continue to be given this choice, diversity and excellence to choose from by private schools.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
On Sunday in San Diego, LeBron started as part of the Lakers
Now the wait for LeBron James fans is about to end as they are going to play their first match for the Los Angeles Lakers very soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James has been named as the preseason opener for Sunday's game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be seen how many minutes they will play.
"They'll play at least a minute and a maximum of 48 minutes," Lakers told via the official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t have to be ready for a preseason game,” he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump held a massive rally for the campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump has scheduled five more rallies next week, including in Tennessee and Mississippi, as well as other favorable venues.
With the Supreme Court barring the scheduled vote in his election to a vacant post, Trump aims to seek help for the upcoming mid-term election because of the risk of Congress being out of control over Republicans at the time of the vote count in November.
When will Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how will you be able to watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online through a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is expected to deliver a speech at this week's hearing for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been barred from a week-long Senate vote during an FIT investigation over allegations of sexual misconduct.
But the main goal of this tense rally is to help Republicans face the November elections.
“The goal of these five rallies next week is to energize volunteers and supporters as part of a Republican effort to protect and increase their blocked majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Trump told Reuters during the campaign.
According to Reuters, a spokesman who has been removed from Trump's campaign said, "Congress control has become so important to his agenda that the president will only visit states where our campaign season is very busy."
“Set in Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, tonight’s rally could bring the attention of Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters to Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, where he received more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is coming forward to help trailing candidate Patrick Morris in a West Virginia Republican Senate survey.
"If the president is trying to give Morris a lead in the election, it's not a good sign for him,"" Simon Haider, political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters."
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showed willingness to compete to keep their hopes of staying on top in the Sunday Singles
After three one-sided sessions, the fourth session on Saturday afternoon will give the result of what is going to happen in this Ryder Cup.
The passage of time cycle is a completely new concept for players, but it cannot be predicted in competitions like this, when a player goes ahead and which player to trust.
So, what will they say about this momentum now?
“They had a six-point lead that’s now down to four, so I think we have to increase our pace a little,” Jordan Spieth explained while walking around the day.
Of course, Europe took advantage of the situation, taking 12 points in the game to four points.
According to Spieth, the American feels they have little chance left and much to encourage, not only from the form of Spieth but also from the form of Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both of them got three out of four points from their game.
Spieth is deadly to everyone from T to Green and also the best in the game.
As their game progressed, people cheered loudly and cheered, as they and Thomas went down two more points after two, putting up a crucial putt to complete four all-squares.
It was because of his put that his team came in 15th position with the same scrim, the sort that tells you that you don't believe the American team out of it.
"You just have to play really well and make sure the win is yours," said Speith.
That's what they say to all the players who have been out of the game.
18 holes to make a mark.
There are only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days, whose names are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, they are making a new history in the Ryder Cup.
Europe's different-styled but better couple have scored four points in four and are at the forefront.
On Saturday afternoon, "Mollywood" was the only pair who did not shoot any bogie, but they stayed away from bogie until Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning before nine o'clock.
On Sunday, he got that run and the way to get that run in this strong crowd and this strong crowd as if they were beaters, and there is no player who could turn the possible victory of the European team into a defeat, it seemed that Le Golf National's sunset would be earlier than Fleetwood or Molinary.
It's good to be able to combine the two in different ways.
However, the dignity of the Europeans has been talked about for a long time.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it a little easier for Foreball hero Sergio Garcia in the morning, at the time his pairing was made with Alex Noren.
In front of nine Dougs, a bogey and two doubles were holed up by Spaniards and Swedes, before which they had never even reached.
However, there was no person present on Sunday to help you reach your hole.
On the watch, Foreball and Foursome were great because the interaction between pairings was great, they advised that they did not need advice and that they were well-versed in how to change tactics.
As a team, Europe played very well and took a significant lead on the last day, but this four-day session also showed that Team USA has the ability to counter what is suspicious, especially in the stateside.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe took a 10-6 lead
Europe will take advantage of this on the last day of the Ryder Cup after a 10-6 lead over the United States on Saturday.
The best pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead over Tiger Woods, struggling with two wins so that they could go far beyond their four points of the Le Golf National in Milan.
Two years ago, Thomas dominated the European side of the morning foreball in the European side to avenge his defeat at Hazeltine, giving him a 3-1 lead in the series.
The U.S. showed more resistance in fours, winning two matches, but they could not avoid losing.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches to maintain the trophy victory.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari started with "Mollywood" after the sensational weekend, the second pair to win four points in their opening four match in Ryder Cup history.
After losing to Woods and Patrick Reed in the foreball, he again beat the best player Woods and American rookie Bryson Deshambu by 5 and 4 points, putting up a much better show than before.
Woods, who put himself ahead by two games on Saturday, showed his best, but has now lost 29 of his 29 matches in Foreball and Foursome and 19 times in seven matches in Rowe.
In the rest of the morning foreball, Justin Rose is back in the fours again with his partner Henrik Stenson and beat world number one and three players Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2-1.
However, on the Pleasant, Breezy Day in the South West of Paris, Europe had no break from it.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, the three-time winners on Saturday, set the benchmark for the Americans by getting two points.
He won 2-1 against Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the foreball and sent back Pauls and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the opening two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup when a team came back from a match reaching the singles with four points, although the way Furyk's side needed it all caught everyone's attention in the trophy.
However, after remaining second-best for two days, the counter-attack on Sunday is about to happen, as distinct from their old game.
North Korea says saying "there is no way out" would only make disarmament one side that can't be trusted
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday the United Nations continued sanctions that were based on its distrust of the United States and showed no way for the country to stop inspecting nuclear bombs on its own in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the World Body's Annual General Assembly last year that North Korea had tried a number of methods that were associated with "significant goodwill," such as halting the testing of nuclear bombs and missiles, dismantling the nuclear bomb testing site, and pledging not to pursue the work of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we have not received any response from the US for this,” he said.
“Without relying on the U.S. in any way, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in situations like this there is no way we can initiate unilateral disarmament.”
While Ri reiterated that the complaints made by North Korea are about Washington's "phased" approach to disarmament, under which North Korea will gradually benefit from, from his statement, it is perfectly clear that this unilateral disarmament cannot be left to one side only because Pyongyang has done so in the past.
At the summit between the serving U.S. President and North Korean leader in Singapore for the first time on June 12, Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, at which time Kim pledged to work toward the "disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has been demanding a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first stop developing its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to lift tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. has stressed disarmament first and raised the level of sanctions pressure so that it can forcefully achieve its objective, and at the same time, it has also objected to the “declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
"Resistance can bend us, such an assumption is a pipe dream of those who are ignoring us."
But the problem is that our confidence is getting further undermined by the continued ban.”
Ri did not discuss plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, he said, adding that the U.S. leader highlighted the strengths of the United Nations last week.
The minister instead discussed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and went on to state: “If the party for this disarmament problem is South Korea and not the U.S., the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will not be involved in such a stalemate.”
Nevertheless, Ri's speech was very different from last year's speech, when he said of the U.N. National Assembly that it was inevitable to target the U.S. mainland with North Korea's rockets after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called him "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim's courage to raise for disarmament but said there was still a lot of work to do and sanctions would remain in place until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump pointed out that he has no deadline set for this, “if it takes two years, three years or even five years – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia have been arguing that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps the U.N. Security Council has taken.
However, on Thursday U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council that: “The Security Council’s sanctions should remain in place until we realize without fail that we are carrying out a thorough, last and verifiable disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously extended sanctions on North Korea in 2006 to fund Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at the U.N. General Assembly and then told him that he would be going to Pyongyang again for a second summit next month.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his previous visit has not been great.
They returned from Pyongyang in July and said the work had moved forward, with North Korea condemning them for "gangster-like demands" within just a few hours.
At this month's Moon meeting, North Korea vowed to destroy the missile site and would also destroy the nuclear complex if the United States adopted "consistent measures."
He pointed out that Kim had promised him a "consistent measure," demanding security guarantees that Trump in Singapore would take the pledge and move toward building normal relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Are Taking Courses for a Job With Enough Rest
Harvard University has launched a new course this year for all its undergraduates who want to get more and more rest while competing in a growing macho culture for study through caffeine-fueled 'all-niters'.
The teacher who teaches the students of the world's number one university often has no choice when it comes to such common things as what to do to relax yourself.
Charles Qazisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has created a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
After talking about the impact of low sleep during teaching time, he came up with the idea of starting this course.
She told The Telegraph, 'I had a girl come up to me at the end of the year and she said: 'Why do I say this every time I have to go to the next class next year?'
She said that no one told her about the importance of sleep – which shocked me.
This year, for the first time, students will learn how good sleeping habits are important in academic and athletic performance, besides improving their general health.
Paul Berrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, said that students do not sleep enough every week, for which the university decided to start this course.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there will be an image of a dormitory room, where students will click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to tell about the impact on caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of sleeping time in the routine.
In the second section, participants will be told that lack of adequate sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons will be shown, then participants will be encouraged to think about their daily routine.
We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But, we believe they should be aware of this - just like smoking cigarettes is aware of the health effects.”
While the culture of being proud of 'waking up all night and reading' still exists, modern technology and increasing pressure on students means they have to sleep less which has become a growing problem, he said.
Ensuring that you get enough and good sleep is like a ‘secret weapon’ of the students, so that they can combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - it also protects against the effects of weight loss because lack of sleep keeps their brains always thinking about hunger, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sow, a 19-year-old from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Jesler build the course, completing his last year of class at Harvard last year.
He said that due to the course, he became aware and motivated for the campus-wide course.
In the future, they hope that it will be considered necessary for all postgraduate students to complete this course before joining a competitive institute.
Prof Jesler suggested that students should consider setting alarms before going to sleep, as well as deciding when they should wake up, and they should be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue light' emitted from electronic screens and LED lights, which can put too much circadian pressure on them, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston's 1 - 0 against the Rangers: Menga scored against Gerard
The Rangers suffered in another match due to Dolly Menga's strike, the responsibility of Livingston's 1-0 victory was put on the wrong side of Steven Gerrard.
Ibroside was looking for their first win after a 4–1 win in a match played at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team instigated Gerard as the manager for their second loss in 18 games to oust Landbrokes Premiership leader Harts by eight points.
Menga struck for seven minutes before half-time and then the Rangers' line-up short did not get a chance to equalize the game even once.
However, the Rangers have now dropped to sixth place in the rankings, Livingston has reached third place and is only behind Hibernian due to goal difference.
In addition, the game can be even more troublesome for Rangers since Linesman Callum Spence's head wound has been treated after the object was clearly thrown at the other end.
Gerard's eight side changes gave the last Ayre a chance to make it to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was included in the same Livy 11 that took a point of the Hurts last week and the way they drilled well made the opposition team trouble at every turn.
The Rangers could have won the match, but Livingston played much better than them.
When Menga first sent Scott Pettman off late to Alan McGregor's goal, he should have given him just two minutes, but the midfielder capitalized on the big opportunity he found.
When Keegan Jacobs, who was in the deep, did the free-kick, the kick went to captain Craig Hulkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow, who was at the back post, could only widen the stub.
The Rangers gained control, but they had more confidence in their game in the final third.
Of course, Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been penalised on the quarter-over mark as he and Steven Lawless clashed with each other, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers saved two shots on target in the first half, but former ibro goalkeeper Liam Kelly had to face difficulties from Lasana Colby's header and a strike from Twy O.V. Azaria.
However, in the 34th minute, Livi's opener could have gone against the run-of-the-game, but no one can deny that he alone deserves this graft.
Even after this, the Rangers could not play the best player Jacob present in the Deep.
When Deccan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield showed no interest in it, with Scott Robinson keeping Menga quiet to pick up the simple finish.
When Gerard swapped Colbybell for Ryan Kent and switched to showing the immediate effect as he was slotted by the winger at Morelos, he had taken a break at the time, but Kelly blocked his line with a fine run.
But, Livingstone showed the visitors the kind of game they could really enjoy, after the long ball, he swept the long ball with Lithgow and the light ball.
Holt's side in the final stage could have extended their lead, but McGregor prevented Jacobs from a well-study up before Lithgow widens from the corner.
The Rangers called Glenn Middleton as an option, they made another late claim to the penalty as they got entangled with Jacobs, but Thomson did not let them succeed again.
Elmanac: Inventor of Geiger Counter
Now a page from our “Sunday Morning” calendar: 136 years ago today, September 30, 1882 and beyond...the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geyser invented a device for the method of detecting and measuring radioactivity that was later known as the Geyser counter.
Geiger is a mainstay of counterintelligence, it has become the mainstay of pop culture, at the same time, in 1950 a film "Bells of Coronado" was made on it, in which scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans first acted:
Man: "What does he do for the world?"
Rogers: "This is a geyser counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
After turning on these earphones you can definitely hear the impact of hidden atoms due to radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "Tell me, right now it's definitely popping!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to be 63 years old.
But, because of his invention, his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can ‘see’ the bad cells of the immune system
The new cancer vaccine can ‘see’ and eliminate the bad cells of the immune system
The vaccine instructs the immune system to identify bad cells during treatment.
Through this method, the immune cells of a patient can be removed and replaced in the laboratory
After that, the common protein for many cancers from them can be ‘sawed’ and then extracted and replanted
In a trial for the vaccine, promising results are being seen in different types of cancer patients.
A woman was given the vaccine, which looked at her damaged cells in the immune system, then it was seen that her ovarian cancer that had existed for more than 18 months was over.
This method can remove and replace a patient's immune cells in the lab, so they can "see" the common protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then remove and replant the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that this vaccine is very promising.”
Prof Berzofsky said HER2 causes "many types of cancer to develop", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers.
Removing patients' immune cells and "instructioning" them to detect cancerous cells is beneficial in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
After his SNL presence, Kanye West on the MAGA Hat condemned Trump's old controversial speech.
It didn't go well
After Kanye West's best performance, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said that his own government will be formed in 2020, he condemned in the studio during Saturday's Night Live.
After the performance of her third song of the night called Ghost Town, in which she wore the Make America Great Cap, she condemned the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
“So, I talk to white people many times and they say: “What’s the reason you like Trump, they’re racist?”
Yet, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago."
SNL started the show with Matt Damon's skit, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's case, it is already known that the Senate Judicial Committee is already investigating claims of sexual harassment made to him by Christine Blasey Ford.
However, nothing like this was shown, footage of West's condemnation was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It was not revealed whether Rock was trying to make West laugh with the posting because of the post.
At the same time, West complained to the audience that he was threatened with going to the backstage with his head wear.
"He threatened me with backstabbing.
"""Don't wear that hat and go there,"" he said."
They threatened me!
He also said that I was stuck in the wrong place," according to the Washington Examiner.
West said: “Do you want to see that wrong place?” At the same time, he said they would “make plays for my Superman cape, because it means that you can’t tell me what to do. The desire to move the world forward is what you do?
Make love."
In his comments he mentioned the audience at least twice and the SNL artists felt embarrassed, in a separate report, one person told the publication: "The whole studio went completely silent."
West was summoned because of the delay in the arrival of singer Ariana Grande, who died a few days ago of Ariana Grande's old boyfriend rapper Mac Miller.
West surprised many viewers by performing the song I Love It, she was dressed like Periyar Bottle.
West again met with Conservative group TPUSA head Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the most courageous people: Thank you for raising a voice for the public.”
But, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "that which she told and which is totally amazing."
“But, I didn’t choose someone who would benefit (by buying my music or clothes or by supporting my “art”) that I think is promoting the wrong idea for my community or mispronouncing my community.
He is free.
That's why we exist," he said.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted on Twitter that he had changed his name, adding that he was just “formally going to be known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name, but did the same before Diddy and Puffie, whose old names were Puff Diddy and P Diddy, respectively.
Along with him, the rapper, Snoop Dogg's old name was Snoop Lion and the music's late famous Prince also changed his name to Symbol and after that the artist was already known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Herrington questions toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's "Violent Middle Fantasy" series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor, who has questioned the role of Macho Hero, said watching such roles on screen often inspires many young boys and feels that such a difficult task is necessary to earn respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit told that he was feeling "something wrong" and asked how to end the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Recently, Kit married her Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, who she believes feels is "strong enough" to talk about the problem.
"""Personally, I feel very strongly that right now - are we doing something wrong with masculinity?"
‘Are we teaching men that when they grow up, they’ll have to deal with the problems they see on screen?’
Kit thinks television may be partly responsible for toxic masculinity, he thanks too much of it to the male-dominated character.
He added: "What happens and what is taught?
From what is taught on TV and on the street, young boys begin to believe that they must do certain things in order to be a man?
In my opinion, this has really become one of the big questions of our time - how can we change this?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the ideas of young men.”
In an interview, he also admitted that when the series of Game of Thrones comes back at the end of next summer, he will not participate in any of its prequels or sequels, as well as, he said that he has done many programs with 'war arenas and horse rides'.
From November, Kit will be working on Sam Shepard's new series of True West, which is the story of a film producer whose brother is a robber.
Recently, the actor revealed that the best thing for him from Game of Thrones is to meet his wife Rose.
“I got my life partner through this show, so I believe this show has given me my future family and my life has moved on from here,” she said.
Rose plays Yegret, the girlfriend of Kit's character John Snow in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple got married with family consent in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: According to the report, there has been a 14% increase in new cases in China
China has announced that there has been a 14% increase in people living with HIV and AIDS in the country.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people across the country are suffering from the disease.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Given the changes that have taken place in recent times, most of the new cases are being attributed to sex.
Traditionally, HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood infections.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health officials said the number of people infected with HIV through this means had almost halved.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 each year.
HIV infection from sex carried out by China's LGBT community is a serious problem.
In 1997, homosexuality was promoted in China, but the LGBT community is reported to be highly discriminated against.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Due to many infections of the disease, there is insufficient protection for sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has tried to solve this problem, promising every person that they will be given access to HIV medicine.
Maxine Waters denied that her staff leaked the GOP senator's data, calling it a "dangerous lie" and a "way of conspiracy."
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters called the allegations made on Saturday "unfortunate," saying one of her employees had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the logger's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims were being investigated by a pundit and website of the "ultra-right wing."
"Liars, lies, and too much hate," Waters tweeted.
Reportedly, the information provided included the addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsay Graham and two Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orin Hatch.
The information was seen online on Thursday, posted by an unidentified person on Capitol Hill, when a Senate panel was hearing allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Questions were being raised on Kavanaugh over the leak of some information of the three senators.
Hill says that the IP address of a conservative site such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, which identifies the source of the person posting, was reported to be linked to the Waters office and the information was released by an employee of Waters.
“This allegation is completely baseless, false and absolutely false,” Waters said.
"None of my employees - whose identity, personal information and security are being put at risk because of these false and false allegations - were in any way responsible for the leak of this information.
This allegation is baseless, totally false and absolutely false.”
Waters soon posted online to clean up the criticism, including the former White House press secretary.
Fletcher wrote, "The reason for this rejection is anger."
"This shows that his nature is not the same as that of a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something, they should not do it in anger.
They should not be rebels.
They should not question the person who has made the allegations.
They should remain calm and be patient.”
Fletcher seemed to be comparing Waters' response to Judge Kavanaugh's condemnation of Democrats, with Kavanaugh being accused by critics of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who defeated Waters in the midterm elections, also shared his views on Twitter.
He had tweeted, "If that's true, that's a big deal."
In his statement, Waters reported that his office had alerted the appropriate authorities and rule enforcement units to these claims of fraud.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators will be told whether or not they will be held legally liable for all the acts they have done that are very bad and dangerous for any and all of my employees,” he said.
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - The spying act by Rowan Atkinson was not considered too strong
From the British point of view, the importance of Brexit is still traditionally seen in any new film, and it seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy Spof franchise that began with Johnny English in 2003 and was brought back in 2011 under the name Johnny English Reborn.
Will we self-sabotage on the subject of how we certainly consider the new export opportunity of the nation to be nonsense?
At any rate, the pop-oriented and rubber-faced inept Johnny English has his license to recreate things with bare feet—much more famous than anything else in his name—a wide range of comic creations for areas where English-speaking people live.
He is definitely the Daft Secret Agent who managed to show Mr Bean's dash Cluso a little bit despite his bizarre pretence in Smoothie Glamour and a dollop for the chap who contributed a single note to Fire Theme Tune's Chariot at the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is originally a passenger and is the International Man of Mystery Atkinson whose role he played in Barclaycard TV commercials was forgotten except for Wake's Chaos.
There are only one or two good scenes in this new JE outing.
I loved Johnny English, which showed me going to the helicopter wearing a medieval suit of armor and wrapping a rotor blade on my helmet.
Performing physical comedy on screen is a kind of gift for Atkinson, but laughter came very little and seemed strangely half-hearted, especially as "excellent" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible present themselves with full confidence as a component of comedy.
Laughter comes as if it were a comedy not for adults but for children, and Johnny English’s strange misunderstandings are not at all tolerable to me and I prefer Bean to Atkinson’s silent film.
What is always relevant right now is that there is a serious crisis in Great Britain.
Britain's most secretive network of spies has been hacked by a cyber-hacker, the network that kept the identity of all of Britain's working agents so that the agent's work could be affected - a tragic event for Kevin Alden.
This is the last resort for the brilliant and quite upset Prime Minister, who is already grappling with many political and unpopular problems: Emma Thompson can play this Quasi-Teresa-Mector well, but the script is not very strong enough to work on this script.
His intelligence advisors told him that every working detective who has entered into an agreement will have to bring in someone who has retired.
In this way it meant that Johnny English would have to fight against himself, who is now a school master at a posh institute, but has to work aside from the record on how an undercover operative should be: it has some good humor, plus, teaching English at a rock-type academy school by a detective.
English has been sent back to the Emergency Whitehall for briefing, and Ben Miller's reprise of the role has been mixed with his much-old pain-inducing sidekick buff.
Now that Buff is married, she is trying to become a submarine commander, her role is of Jolly-Hockey-Sticks in which Vicky Pepperdine has not been able to settle.
So, in her Majesty's Secret Service, Batman and Robin make some huge mistakes when they encounter Olga Krulenko's beautiful femme torn Ophelia Bouletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger of speaking out about the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he has a solution to Britain’s computer crises: the sinful Jason Volta played the role of Jake Lacey.
English and Bog Fersiel begin their odyssey of high-jinks: working as waiters set fire to a French restaurant; they smuggle through Volta's expensive boat; and English fully activates chaos when it uses a virtual keyboard to try the interior of the Volta's house.
The film has definitely been drawn everywhere for that last sequence, but still it is well-crafted and entertaining, there are a lot of fun things for children throughout the film.
of a medium-sized scale.
Also, as I saw in other Johnny English films, in this film, I did not understand whether Rowan Atkinson should be given a role in the British film industry that really suits his talent?
Labour has denied that it plans to offer only four days of work a week for British people, but will receive the money for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a pro-democracy plan in which UK residents will only have to work four days a week - but will get the money for five days.
The party reportedly wants the owners of the company to give part of the savings through Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers so that they can get an additional day off.
This will give the employee three days of leave a week - but they will still be able to get the same pay.
Sources said such an idea would be "influenced" with the party's economic agenda and it is a plan to benefit the workers of the country.
The Trades Union Congress is promoting a four-day shift a week so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party employee told The Sunday Times: “The policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but it is expected to take four days of work week, which is in line with the party’s overall industrial strategy as well as the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers.”
With the Green Party promising a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign, the Labour Party will not be the first party to support such an idea.
However, this desire is not being fully supported by the Labour Party at present.
A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘The four-day work week is not the party’s policy and is not being considered by the party.’
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to present his approach to the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to get power back from "faceless directors" and "profiteerers" in utility firms.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that existing shareholders in water companies cannot get their entire stake back as the Labour government can deduct on the basis of alleged wrongdoings.
He also confirmed plans to create an inclusive ownership fund to include employees on company boards and hand over 10 per cent equity of private sector firms for employees, who can receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Cavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Cavana delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and the question arises whether the Bureau's findings helped a Republican senator withdraw his support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility the FBI would find something that would inspire them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared to be more articulate than his South Carolina ally.
"I think so," Kennedy said.
"I said that while going to the hearing, I talked to Judge Kaavana.
After that happened, when this allegation came to light, I called them, asked, 'Did you do that?'
They were determined, determined, clear.
However, Graham's vote, it seemed, was a stone's throw.
"I had made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would require explosive accusations," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And the one whom he named, he could not verify it.
This is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual concert featuring several highly influential stars performing, and equally influential is its mission; to end the world’s poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Great Lawn of Central Park at the Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the program to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Beginning in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival, an international advocacy group, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, which actively hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting against it.
To receive free tickets to the event (except when you’re not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must complete “actions” in a number of ways, such as becoming a volunteer, emailing a world leader, making phone calls, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal in the remaining 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people through a free concert the right way to persuade people to call for action, or just another case of so-called “cliquetivism” – making people feel like they’re truly making a difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing efforts for various goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, at least $10 billion of which are already distributed or fund-raising.
The group estimates that the safe fund has so far directly impacted about 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include, The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based participation of investors and implementers who are committed to "help children grow to their full potential" while pledging Rwanda $35 million to end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national government, and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote to history,” said Tracy Ulman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to a frequently asked question on your website, “Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and hard road — sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Gene Moni are among the few performers to perform at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Debra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy for a "blockade" to hinder Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington Examiner quoted Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke as revealing that Washington could "if necessary" resort to the U.S. Navy to curb Russian energy in U.S. markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleged that Russia's work in Syria - especially where it is operating at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is because they want to broker energy, as they have done in Europe's southern region, Eastern Europe.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability with our Navy to ensure that sea routes remain open, and, if necessary, blockade, to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they are effectively the same.
Referring to Russia as “a one-trick pony” with a fossil fuel-dependent economy, he said, “In the case of Iran and Russia, the economic option, more or less, is to take advantage of the fuel and replace it.”
The statements are coming as the Trump administration, replacing Russia, is on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that extent, officials in the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, according to Trump which, according to him, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s widespread opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, “I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers.”
The U.S. approach was opposed by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kemf, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "I have a big problem when a big state interferes with our energy supply.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the case of her running for president in 2020, she said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "seriously consider" the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the race.
According to The Hill, she said, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and connect with our broken government and that includes being a woman in the top post.”
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren assessed President Donald Trump during the town hall, saying, "They're taking this county in the wrong direction."
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy after all," he said.
Warren, Trump and their Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh have been vocal in their criticism.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need to get the FBI investigation done before voting."
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's constituents don't think he should contest the 2020 election.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe Poll, eighty-eight percent of "potential" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not contest the election.
Thirty-two per cent voted in favour of contesting the election in this way.
The survey showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's case of contesting the election, where 38 percent supported potential involvement in the race and 48 percent were against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names likely to run in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the army in September.
He was arrested in a domestic violence incident on Monday night
At a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he told the audience, “I have sympathy for other families who feel the impact of PTSD and the wounds with which our soldiers come back.”
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other retired soldiers, "They return with little change, they return hardened, they return wondering if this honor is for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army have sacrificed for the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, she was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and a woman was charged with domestic violence and possession of an intoxicated weapon.
18 states, D.C. support new asylum policy challenge
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to gang escapers or victims of domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a Justice-Friends summary in Washington on Friday to support a refugee who challenges the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been disclosed in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy.
She said her partner "and the sons of members of her violent gang" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Government lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as nations facing widespread problems of gang and domestic violence, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. refugees.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed unorganized immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia’s Attorney General Carl Ressin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
"The federal statute requires that all asylum claims must be adjudicated on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an interdict violates that principle," the judge said.
The attorney further argued in the abstract that the policy denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy by saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply essential labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
In its June 11 policy announcement, Sessions said, “Refugees are available for those who leave their country due to persecution or fear of persecution due to their race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group.”
Refuge was never meant to alleviate all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
The death toll in the search for survivors has risen to double that of Palu.
For the survivors, the situation was extremely serious.
"It feels extremely stressful," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who consoled a child suffering from a fever at the exit center of the city of Tahs-Nahas Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings dead bodies.
Clear water is rare."
Residents were seen returning to their desolated homes, picking up submerged goods, trying to save whatever was found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals drowned in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwyer Harris, who was facing broken back and shoulder, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated in the open outdoors due to persistent strong earthquake tremors.
Tears welled up in his eyes as he felt the violent earthquake in his fifth-floor hotel room shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think, I was buried in the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, as well as told that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' through 'propaganda ads'
A week after the state-run Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad, referring to the mutual benefits of the US-Chinese trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to propagate propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday - after accusing China of trying to meddle in the November 6 congressional elections - referred to China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, which China denies.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections, US officials told Reuters there was a new stage in the campaign to pressure China by Washington.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to boost trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in a growing trade war that has seen them impose tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's retaliatory customs earlier in the trade war were designed to strike at exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and Iowa's long-time former governor, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in Sunday’s Des Moines Register that China, “is now doubling that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own independent press.”
"In its propaganda, by placing paid ads in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's cherished tradition of free speech and independent journalism," Branstad wrote.
"Given that the media is locked in a strong fist of the Chinese Communist Party, in contrast, here at the roadside newsstand in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and no true reflection of the inconsistent opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's worrisome economic curve line," he wrote.
He said that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish his article on the pretext of” although he did not name the newspaper.
With Kavanaugh's defeat, Republicans are isolating female voters ahead of the mid-term election, analysts warn
As top Republicans continue to support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavana, facing multiple allegations of sexual harassment, the analyst has warned they will see a backlash during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions around it are quite overwhelming, and most Republicans are already showing on record that they want to move forward with the vote.
Those things can't be put back on," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reehar said he suspected that the pressure at the last minute for an FBI investigation by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would be enough to pacify angry voters.
"Women can't forget what happened yesterday - neither tomorrow nor November," said Karen Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to a Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee wanted to proceed with Cavanna's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, protesters at the Senate hallway shouted "November is coming!", Mick reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to move away from the chart,” Stu Rothenberg, a non-political analyst, told the news site.
"People are saying it's already huge; it's true.
But it could be more, especially among women voters in the suburbs and 18-to-29-year-old young voters who don’t vote often when the president doesn’t like it.”
Elaborating on the allegations of sexual assault by Ford against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had already said before public testimony that there was a possibility of opposition if Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said, “It has become a tangled mess for the GOP.”
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or putting Cavanna on the bench, it's also about the matter of how Republicans have handled it and how they've treated them," Guy Cecil, director of Privileges USA, an organization that helps Democrats in the election, told the news channel.
However, the Americans appear to be somewhat divided on who to believe in the wake of the testimony of Ford and Cavanna, most of whom seem to favor Cavanna.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford’s testimony definitively or potentially, while 35 percent said they believed definitively or potentially in Cavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Cavanaugh might or certainly did lie during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee by swearing last week that Cavanaugh assaulted her drunkly at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee displayed his genitals when he joined a party while studying in Yale in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet in comparison to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the technology legend's latest project, is a company that builds Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who will be allowed to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to achieve "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
This may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and business tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data stores is that it completely depends on the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea of Inrupt is to bring resources, process and appropriate skills by the company so that Solid can be made available to everyone.
The company currently includes a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are "not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to initiate a complete transformation, where all of their business models will be gone overnight."
"We are not asking permission from them."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vaughan: Celebrating WW1 Victoria Cross Clark
The only pastor of the Church of England to win the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was celebrated 100 years in his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vaughan won this award in the attack on Belangais and Lehcourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and he never knew he had won the highest British military honor.
The memorial stone was unveiled by two of his ships at a parade held in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vaughan, said it was "gloriously symbolic" that the stone was being unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vaughan led his battalion to the Canal de Saint-Quentin "amidst a very dense fog, under heavy shelling and machine guns on the battlefield."
They later moved to the firing line and, with "great gallantry", led the military-line and dashed three detachments before taking the field-gun in hand alone.
On October 4, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vaughan was killed by a German sniper, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vaughan, 72, said that his grandfather's accomplishments "were something that I know can never be equaled, but which we are proud of."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vaughan, also garlanded after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said they are “very honoured to play the role at the parade” and that “the support being given by many is demonstrating the heroics of a real hero.”
MMA fans kept waking up all night to see Bellator 206, but instead they got the Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed up all night to watch the crowded Balloter 206, but were deprived of watching the main event.
San Jose's bill had 13 contests, including six on the main card and being shown live all night on UK Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the U.K. were stunned by the coverage being turned into a Peppa Pig.
Some were extremely disappointed after waking up early in the morning, especially for the match.
A fan on Twitter described switching to children's cartoons as "a kind of sickly joke."
When asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Ballator, said, “This content was not suitable for 6 a.m. in accordance with government regulation, so they had to switch to children’s programming.”
"""Peppa the Pig,"" yes."
Scott Coker, president of the Bellator company, said that they are going to work on their scheduling to include a UK audience in the future.
"I think when I think about replays, I think we'll probably find a solution," Coker said.
"But then there will be six o'clock on Sunday morning and we won't be able to work on it until Sunday, our time, their time on Monday."
But we are working on it.
Believe me, there was a lot of text movement when this change happened and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it was not, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that won’t happen next time.
We would limit it to five instead of six - like we usually do - and when we tried to deliver a little more for the fans, it was just too much.
It is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley Feels ‘Insane’ in terms of Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he became obsessed with a sense of inferiority to everyone because of his sexuality - but he was inspired by it to succeed.
The 24-year-old said she didn't realize until she reached secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disc presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she talks about gay rights to give others “hope.”
She also said that when she became a father, she cared less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young has taken several months off due to illness.
On Laverne’s first appearance as a socially-challenged man at the event, Daly said she felt “lacked” in herself more than everyone else because “it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls.”
She said: “Even today, those feelings of feeling inferior to others, and feeling different, are the real things that have given me the strength and strength to be able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was also “fat,” she said, so that he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
Two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used her presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to reduce homosexuality.
She said that she spoke openly because she felt lucky to be able to live openly without any trouble and that she wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that when she fell in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "I was surprised."
Daily married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but she said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so many experiences at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - she said it was hard to find a middle-aged man going through the same ups and downs as he did at such a young age.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily in June, and the Daily said his "whole approach" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would have been all about 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are a lot more things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son's name is similar to his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily said his father did not accept that he was going to die and the last thing he wanted to know was if he had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell them that you wouldn't be sitting in the front row, Dad," she said.
He said, “I was holding their hands when they could not breathe, and I held them until they stopped breathing and they were dead, so I went and believed they were not invincible.”
The following year, Daly competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"All I knew was that this is what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a crowd of indigenous people at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling than that," she said.
It also inspired his favorite first song - Proud by Heather Small - that had been resonating with him while preparing for the Olympics and that still made his rongs stand out.
Desert Island Disc will air on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST on Sunday.
Out-of-form Mickelson out of Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when they play their 47th Ryder Cup match, but they will have to change their form to save it from becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Playing in the biennial event for the 12th time on record, Mickelson was dropped from the game by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's Foreballs and Forums.
Instead of becoming a center of attraction, as he has often remained for the United States, the five-time major winner spent his day living among cheerleaders and working in the hope of improving the weaknesses of his playing style.
Never driving directly even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete has not been an ideal fit for the Tight Le Golf National Course, where those who have not been active for a long time are regularly punished for the wrong shots.
And while the course isn't that easy, in Sunday's ninth match, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has played together with Rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the American players, who started with four points down in 12 singles matches, get off to a strong start, then Mickelson's match can prove to be very important.
Furyk confided in his man, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood his role, patted my back and encircled me in his arms and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's very confident in himself.
He is the Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably wouldn’t have imagined him playing two matches.
I had imagined more, but it worked the way we did and the way we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to go out there just like everybody else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most-played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never touched the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, although Furyk said his presence brings some intimacy to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's responsive, he likes to make fun of people, and his presence in the team room is special," he explained.
"I think the young players also enjoyed going to him, this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
Europe's captain Thomas Bjorn knows the big edge could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from his experience that a fairly large lead in the last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable move.
Dane made his first appearance in a 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Sieve Ballesteros took a five-point lead over the Americans, but with a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 victory, taking the lowest margin, just reached the finishing line.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, we were just able to win," Byrne said, after seeing the 2018 class take a 5-3 lead on Friday and a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National yesterday.
So history will show me and all the people on that team that it's not over.
You'll pay the full price tomorrow.
Get out there and do the right thing.
It doesn't end until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win this trophy and that's where the focus is to keep going.
I've always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're well aware that the greatest players around the world - stand on the other side."
Bjorn went on to explain how his players performed on the tough golf course: "In this I will never be able to surpass myself.
Tomorrow is a different hard time.
Personal performances will come out tomorrow, and that's a different thing.
It's great to go there with a partner when everything is going well, but when you get out there in person, your potential as a golfer is fully tested.
That's the message you need to convey to the players to showcase their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and he too has to give his best."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite stand-in Jim Furyk would have been hoping for a better performance personally for his players than he did as a partner, with the exception being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who had three of the four points.
Before facing defeat due to Europe performing "Miracle in Medina", being part of the winning team at Brooklyn, F<0xC3><0xBC>hrer himself has been on both ends of those big final days of reflection."
"I remember every moment of it," he said when asked how captain Ben Cranshaw handled his players on the last day in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'll want to start the kind of fast like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When this pace is one-sided, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches between them.
We set our line-up at our own pace and involved people in a way that, as we felt, you know, we're trying to do some more miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead a counter-attack with Rory McLaren in the top match, where Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other top half of the European order.
"I made these groupings in this order because I think it covers everyone," Bjorn said of his single selections.
Germany's new warship has been put on hold again.
New German Navy warships should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the time-influenced Cold War-era warships, but due to faulty systems and rapidly rising costs, this will not happen until at least next year, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Reinland-Puffalz", the flagship ship of the brand new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class warships, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but after delivery the troubling issues affected the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships were ordered by the Navy back in 2007 to be brought in as replacements for the Kal-influenced Bremen-class warships.
It is understood that they will facilitate an array of powerful cannons, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology such as low radar, infrared and acoustic divisions.
Other important features include long maintenance periods - it is possible to deploy the latest warships from indigenous ports for up to two years.
However, the continued delay means that state-of-the-art warships - allowing Germany to have power projects abroad - will be timeless by the time they enter service, Die Zein commented.
The tragic F125 warship made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to Blohm and Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the ship's manufacturer after delivery.
Very few people knew about the reasons for the withdrawal, but German media cited several important "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless when deployed on war missions.
The software's shortcomings were particularly significant because the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships would be powered by a crew of some 120 sailors - just half the manpower of the old Bremen-class warships.
In addition, it also emerged that the ship is dramatically over-weight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne "Reinland-Puffalz" is thought to be twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project – including crew training – is becoming an issue.
It is said to have risen from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn).
The problem of new warships, which have become especially important in the light of recent warnings, is tightening Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy was actually "putting an end to the fleet-capable ships."
The official said the issue has become serious over time as the old ships were decommissioned but no replacement ships were made available.
He said none of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class warships were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust is secretly listening to the secret life of bats
The new research being conducted at an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use natural landscapes in their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique mammals that fly and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by scientists at the National Trust of Scotland, will follow normal and soprano pipestrels, as well as brown-eared long-eared and doubenton bats nestled in Weston Ross's Inverway Garden.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the estate to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings reveals the frequency of bat calls and what species are doing.
Then a detailed landscape-scaled map and report of the natural habitat will be prepared for illustration.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s nature conservation consultant, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of natural habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of natural habitat management functions such as the construction of grasslands and how to maintain woodlands well for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout the UK has declined significantly over the past century
They are threatened by construction and development works, which affect the bases of birds and damage the natural habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose risks, as some chemical treatments of flypaper and building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats, can pose a threat.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey due to their hunting habits.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technology to point out flaws and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, inspect bird bases and sometimes rescue them.
The organization has set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in the Three Estates of Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the best place for him.
"We have a great area for bats here in the trivet," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the good natural habitats.
But there's so much that's still unknown about bats, so the work we do here and in other estates will help us understand what they need to thrive."
They stress the importance of checking for bats before they are maintained within the estates, because it is possible that unknowingly 400 females and infants could be destroyed by the destruction of the maternity base, possibly destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or disturb them or destroy their bases.
Elizabeth Farrell, the Scottish officer at the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come forward to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our species we still don’t know how their population is growing.”
Ronaldo dismisses claims of rape, while lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape claims against him "false news", saying people want to "promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyer is about to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward are accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Meyerga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Dere Spiegel reported on Friday that he allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
Addressing his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video after reporting the claims, the 33-year-old described the reports as "false news."
“No, no, no, no, no, no.
What he said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be popular by taking my name, but that’s part of their job.
I'm a happy person and all is well," the player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for the charges, according to Reuters, which he has called "suspiciously invalid reporting in the area of privacy."
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the players “will seek compensation for moral damage in amounts commensurate with the severity of the violation, which is possibly one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to papers filed in Nevada's Clark County District Court, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was "99 percent" a "good guy" whose "one percent" has disappointed.
Documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the pair had sex, but there was mutual consent for it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and also photographed her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "scared by the retaliation" and was "concerned about being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to end the deal as harassment has continued since the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and signed a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal with Italian giant Juve this summer.
Brexit: UK will ‘regrets forever’ of losing carmaker
Trade Secretary Greg Clark said the U.K. "will regret it forever" if it loses its title as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He said that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the European Union, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnstone near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the border delay could have an impact on jobs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Burnstone plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“I believe that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s managing director at Burnstone.
Other UK carmakers have raised fears about leaving the EU without agreeing on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its mini plant for a month after Brexit in Oxford.
According to car manufacturers, the main concerns are related to the risk of supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts from made-to-order cars arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruption at the border, according to industry that could lead to delays and a shortage of spares.
The company said that it would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's inventory at its Derbyshire plant, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s Checkers plan for future relations with the EU was “purely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border.”
“We need a deal. We want a great deal that I think can not only enjoy success in the present, but which is also necessary to achieve this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“Not only Toyota but there’s evidence from other manufacturers that we should be able to fully continue this which has been a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the long term, warned that the additional cost would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lead to jobs being lost.
Peter Sauvallis, who has worked at Burnstone for 24 years and is the convener of the Unite Union at the plant, said that his members are highly concerned: “In my experience once these jobs are gone, they never come back later in the badge.”
An official spokesman said: “We have put forward an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again
The White House said on Sunday that Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed "another week later" as Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh's struggle continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, the relationship between Trump aides and Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thereby jeopardize Mueller's freedom, the news has warmed Washington's rumored market for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wiretapping and removing the president through the 25th Amendment to record conversations with Trump.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, they went to the White House amid reports that they were going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "not like" Rosenstein's removal but then delayed the meeting to avoid a confrontation with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which both Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into claims against Cavanaugh, delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “The date has not been set for this, it could be this week, I can see that the eyes on all other cases going on with the Supreme Court can be pushed one more week.”
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some journalists have claimed that: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since Sept. 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to TV reporters’ disapproval of the “greatness,” though he said: “I don’t disagree with the fact that they’re grand.”
She then suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
“The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any other president,” she said, without citing evidence, adding: “We’ve seen those numbers.”
The briefing would still take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s better than talking to me.”
We try very hard to do that and you’ve seen us do that a lot in the last few weeks and when you can talk to the President of the United States he’s going to take the place of the press talks.”
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or at press conferences with dignitaries.
Single press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the President appeared before reporters in New York and, at times, with a unique presence, perhaps to show why.
Health Secretary NHS writes to EU workers in Scotland about fears of Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in the NHS in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish them continued post-Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish government is committed to meeting the cost of settlement status applications for EU citizens already working in its degraded public services.
In her letter, Miss Freeman wrote: “In the summer, the reciprocity between the UK and the EU continued, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also pushing its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know it must have been a very uncertain time for all of you.
That’s why I wanted to reiterate now how much I value each staff member’s contribution, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from the EU, and beyond, bring with them valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here.”
Kristian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Kristian Abercrombie, who lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, underwent emergency surgery following a head injury, said Mike Organ.
Tennessee state head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the shore and just fell there," Reed said.
The trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.
An official from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Aberdromby had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said "there are no details available on the type/limitation of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is the redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
He made a total of five tackles on Saturday before dropping out of the game, taking his season total to 18 tackles.
High stamp duty will be charged from foreign buyers when buying property in the U.K.
When foreign buyers buy property in the UK, they will be charged higher stamp duty, which will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory schemes.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
Enhanced stamp duty will be imposed on those who are not paying tax in the UK
The Treasury hopes to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the homeless
Preparations are being made to charge a higher stamp duty rate when buying property in the U.K. from foreign buyers - the additional cash that will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is being seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign that has attracted young voters with a promise to provide more affordable housing and target higher earners.
The stamp duty hike will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional money that will boost the government's campaign to deal with those sleeping under adverse circumstances.
Surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, which includes purchases of two homes and rentals started two years ago, can be a maximum of three percent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly-built London properties are bought by non-UK residents, leading to a rise in prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to set foot on the housing ladder.
Many wealthy regions of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people build their first home.
He accused large construction firms of overestimating property prices by grabbing land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to leave quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain's "housing poverty."
Mr Corbyn has announced an exciting series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and an end to "no-fault" disputes.
They want to give councils more authority to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build lives here.
However, it is not true that it is as easy for individuals not living in the UK as it is for foreign-based companies to buy a home for hard-working British residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a house has become a distant dream, and the fury of sleeping under odd circumstances is extremely real.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to become a Scotland manager at some stage.
Scott, 42, is reiterating the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently third in League One, and which is three points away from the top.
They moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren for the Scottish Premiership last year.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsground.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden with my father since childhood, and it's always been something that pulls me back.
This opportunity will come only when I succeed in club management.”
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Goos Poyet and Paulo de Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he didn't feel nervous following established names at such a large club that had previously rejected the initiative of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For now, success for me can be gauged from whether I can return this club to the Premier League."
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly comes into the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I'll probably see myself as a success here if I can get the club there."
Having spent 15 months as Dumbarton's assistant boss and Harts' coaching staff, Ross' management career has only been three years.
He then helped Aloha recover from the decline of the third tier, and replaced St. Mirren with the downfall of the championship title winners the following season.
And Ross says they feel more comfortable now than they did during their careers at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academics.
"This was probably the real intersection," he said in the case of Aloy taking over.
"I really believed that management was a much better fit for me than playing.
It seems strange because I did the right thing, earned a fair amount of money from it, and enjoyed some reasonably highs.
But it can be hard to play.
On a weekly basis you have to get a lot of things.
I still go through them in terms of job stress and pressure but in terms of management everything seems fine.
I always wanted to manage and now that I’m doing it, it makes me feel most comfortable in my entire adult life.”

The exact time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday, the survey found.
The summer heat has fueled Britain's struggling pubs, but it has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The pub and bar group saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant fluctuations were down 4.8 percent, the data showed.
Peter Martin, business consultancy CGA, which compiles the data, said: “The continued sunshine and July compared to England’s expected participation in the World Cup meant that similar patterns were followed in the month of June last year, when pubs were up 2.8 percent, except that restaurants faced even more difficulties.
The restaurant trade fell 1.8 percent in June and worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that sell alcohol performed the strongest with more likes than restaurants.
Food-driven pubs also suffered damage in the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out to drink.
For the month, sales of drinks in all pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent, while food declined by three per cent.
Paul Newman, leisure and hospitality analyst RSM, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The impact of weather and major social or sports events constitute the biggest factor for sales in the outdoor market.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups continued to struggle, although a 4.8 percent year-over-year drop in sales, especially due to ongoing cost pressure, would be painful.
The long summer season could not have been a bad time for food processors, and only time will tell if the high-medium temperature we experienced in August will provide much-needed relief.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slow pace in brand roll-out.
Coffer Pitch Tracker collects and analyzes data from 47 operating groups performing with a combined turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion to monitor industry sales for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, and is an established industry benchmark.
One in five children have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
The survey shows that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in "fake Insta" pages
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found a rapid increase in “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a clean “main” account to show parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who suddenly saw her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found that one teenager in it was urging others to "rape me."
Research by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which were accepted to hold private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s very disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Ilyich Doyle will have a "voice for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Ilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and Chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those guiding the sport to benefit from his vast experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a lot of respect for the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure that bringing athletics to the board in Scotland will go a long way," Beatty said.
Doyle said: “I’m looking forward to working as the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide for the sport in Scotland.”
In addition to his four Olympic gold medals, Americans who won the 200m and 400m races at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and who are now regular BBC pundits became unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago today I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
Only time will tell if I will be okay and to what extent I will be okay.
It was horrible work, but to fully recover, to walk again and to practice agility today!
Thanks for the messages of encouragement!"
Comparison of mothers’ cows by breast pump advertising created differences in opinion of online people
A breast pump company divided opinion online by an ad that compares lactating mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a product called "the world's first silent wearable breast bump," consumer tech company Elvie released a new fun music video-inspired ad in which the new pump gives mothers the freedom to express themselves.
In a barn full of cows, four real mothers dance to a song that contains some sort of saying: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't the thighs, these are my breasts."
Corus continues: “Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Feeding Them Babies, Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Milking My Ladies.”
In any case, the advertisement, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it portrays the dairy industry's "horribleness" in a light-hearted way.
"Using cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen within a few days after they are born," one wrote.

Another comment: "Of course, painful for both the mother and the baby."
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have the opportunity to keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "What an irrelevant ad."
Others defended the ad, with one woman saying she found the ad's song "ridiculous."
"I think it's a great idea.
I would have had it if I was still breastfeeding.
I have the experience of being a cow.
This ad is a bit weird, but I saw it the way it is.
One person said it was a good product."
The second commented: “It’s a funny ad for mothers who pump (often in their workplace or toilet) and feel like a “cow.”
This is not a promotion or a decisive advertisement for the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reported that they kept dancing by carefully pumping in their bras.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump breast say they feel like they are a cow.
However, the Elvi pump is well hidden, has no wires or tubes and is carefully fitted directly into a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their babies, and even go outside without pumping.
Anna Ballerin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvy Pump is a revolutionary product, entitled to a banging and spectacular launch.
By outlining the parallels between women and dairy cows, we want to bring breast pumping and its challenges to the spotlight, demonstrating a sense of freedom in an entertaining and related way that will bring new pumps.
This is not the first time that Alvi pump has been in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children using the product appeared to be catwalking for designer Marta Jaquebowski.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The captured migrant children were spied on, even when there is no change in the monthly border crossing relative, partly because the harsh curvature and policies offered by the Trump administration have made it difficult to employ children with sponsors.
Traditionally, the maximum sponsors themselves had employed undocumented immigrants and they feared to jeopardize their own ability to live in the country by going ahead and claiming any children.
The threat escalated in June, when federal rights announced that potential sponsors and other adult or older members of the household would have to give out their fingerprints and the data would then be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, a senior official of Matthew Albans, Immigration and Customs Enforcement submitted evidence to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Approximately 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's household live illegally in the country and most of them are criminals.
That's why we continue to search for those individuals," Mr Albans said.
Seeking to prepare the children quickly, the authorities introduced new rules, according to which the children were required to appear in court within a month of being caught instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard according to the staff taking shelter.
Many appear through video conference calls rather than in person to present their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed unfit to be released are immediately fired.
The longer children remain captive, the more likely they are to remain restless or depressed, which can be quantified in violent impulses or escape attempts, according to conservation staff and systems reports in recent months.
Lawyers or advocates said those cases are taken to a higher facility like Torniello, where signs that the child is struggling are ignored because of their size.
At the same time, he said that taking the children to the tent city without giving them enough time to be emotionally ready or without saying goodbye to friends will add to the shock he is already struggling with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even when the country was now in its eighth year of war.
Moulam, who also serves as a deputy prime minister, said foreign military forces illegally live on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be treated accordingly."
"They must immediately and unconditionally withdraw from the battlefield," he told the assembly.
Moulam stressed that the "war is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and many millions have been uprooted from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight this "supernatural war until we both clear all terrorist groups and all Syrian territories of the "appearance of a foreigner."
The United States has some 2,000 military forces in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian military forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military forces on the ground in the country devastated by war.
On the matter of refugees, Moulam said the conditions were fine for them to return and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading fear of helplessness" that led the refugees to stay away.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to simplify this withdrawal,” he said.
“They were politicizing a completely humane matter.”
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would receive no aid to rebuild until a political agreement was reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
A recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the heart of Idlib's last major uprising creates an opportunity to put further pressure on political negotiations, say United States politicians.
The Russian-Turkish deal avoided a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province where three million people lived.
Moulam, however, said the agreement has a "clear timeline" and hoped the military action would target jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda linked to the Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out."
U.S. Representative Stephane Di Mistura hopes to hold the first meeting of a new committee with members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution to fix the path to Syria and elections soon.
Moulam placed certain conditions on the committee for the Syrian government's participation, saying that the work of the panel should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and to warn against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term in office
By that logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless many liberals or elites are hoping for a conviction and a scam to end his term prematurely.
Undoubtedly "This will be the most dramatic end of the national post ever!"
So far, no fatigue was visible to the audience.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings on CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average prime-time viewership of more than 1.7 million over the past four years, and MSNBC's "The Resilient Mado Show" found itself at the top of cable ratings with the major news airing at night, garnering 3.5 million viewers.
An ABC drama about the Cabinet Secretary who becomes president after being destroyed on the U.S. House of Representatives building in an invasion, its director Neil Baer said that "it's a fire that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand."
Neil Scowell, a veteran comedy writer and creator of “Just the Funny Parts: And Hollywood Boys” is a different theory of some of the harsh truths hidden in “Clubs.”
She recalls a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"She said, 'Because they make me laugh,'" Ms. Scowell told me.
There was a value to entertainment in disarray.
Of course, stories coming out of Washington, on TV and beyond, can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the unity of immigrant families, and the health of the global economy.
Only the privileged audience could afford to ignore it.
And yet, it’s beyond being an informed citizenry when you find yourself watching a six-hour debate by a panel of experts, using the root cause of Woodward’s “Deep Backgrounds” for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s 15,000-dollar bomber jacket (“A Thick Fabric with Habreis” said by the Washington Post) and Stormy Denny’s Trump by Daniels.
I'll never see Super Mario that way again.
Brent Montgomery, creator of Wheelhouse Entertainment and “Pon Stars,” said “as part of everything he does, which makes it exactly like a reality show where he brings something new to you every night,” which is about the rotating cast of Trump’s show and the everyday plot twist (N.F.L., about to have any quarrels, Kim Jong-un’s.
You can't afford to skip a single episode or you'll be left behind.

In the run up to the election house, there was a flood of external money in the strong Madhya Pradesh
It was not surprising that Pennsylvania was flooded with money or cash in the 17th, thanks to the reconstruction of the Congress chamber, which led to two incumbents running for the same seat.
Which recently opened the front for the Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb of the suburban Pittsburgh district - who won his seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamps were also involved in the race for a second term, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The map or maps were redrawn in January after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Republicans in a case of unconstitutional forgeries by older districts.
In the new 17th race, the empty-handed fight between major finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) had touched the campaign's economy.
The name of Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
For this reason, the seat was held by Republicans for almost a decade and President Donald Trump won that district by 20 points.
The political pundits instigated the democrats a little more.
U.S. Punishing El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Retreating
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing because of resistance by Washington.
Mr. Trump held an enthusiastic meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization’s management team fired the partners.
Earlier this month, Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement that "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan" were made by state department officials to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
But only El Salvador was penalized, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including Narcotics Control, Development, and Economic Assistance.
The proposed penalties, which included cutting financial aid and targeting visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
When progress was made in internal meetings or meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed the high-level conference, focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow that gathering or gathering as they did last year, which was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent immigrants from leaving the United Nations.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead and effectively end, considering any penalties or fines for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is set to address the conference in a sign of importing administrative positions at the conference, which has now been scheduled for mid-October, diplomats said.
And the three Americans quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, described by three U.S. officials, including two politicians, who agree to discuss internal discussions on the condition of anonymity.
Their accounts have been confirmed by an external analyst, who is close to the administration and also speaks on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next case could be the Special Council Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible resistance to justice, of which there is now enough evidence in the public record.
At the same time, according to Mr. Mueller's report, the direction of his investigation changes if Mr. Trump's campaign colludes with Russia to attack our elections.
When Congress shakes hands, Mr. Trump finds himself accountable to the body when he prepares himself to go before voters again and perhaps to a jury of his colleagues.
That is to say, a lot if or if and I do not mean to indicate or suggest that Mr. Trump’s collapse is not inevitable, nor is the collapse of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have options to choose from on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the conflict can last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make a move against Hitler, only if he was opposed by the West and supported by Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, as a result of which we missed the opportunity to stop the genocide of so many years.
The functioning of the historical focal points around such inflection points and the unobstructed march of democracy are accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face many of these divisive points.
If Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the final outcome of Mr. Mueller’s investigation, what would we do?
Rosenstein has been in this dilemma ever since this paper reported it last year, he suggested keeping the president's record in secret and considering his disqualification for office.
Mr. Rosenstein submits that the account of The Times is not accurate.
"If the F.B.I. investigation of the recently requested Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he continues to remain steadfast in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony, how will we respond?"
And beyond that, will we vote for Congress in the medium term, for which Mr. Trump will be responsible?
If we fail in those investigations, democracy will last for a long winter.
But I think we will not fail because of the lessons I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who had also previously occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived and settled in the US and after 60 years she sent me to burn the Sabeth candles on a table made of swastikas.
With the same as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about my future?"

Graham Doran's Rangers Are Still Optimistic After Sharp Vienna Encounter
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, winning over the Austrians would put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevents midfielder Graham Doran from appearing for the first time in a season with Villarreal up to a 2-2 draw, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
“It was a good thing for us because Villarreal was good,” the 31-year-old said.
"We went ahead in the game with the belief that we can get something and come to a conclusion.
Maybe we can get it done in the end, but overall, the draw will probably be a fair result.
They were probably better in the first period and we came out even better in the second period.
Moving on to Thursday, it’s another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a difficult game because they got good results with the crowd or crowd behind us in their last game, I am sure we will play well and get positive results.
Whatever happened to my injuries and the changes made to the club itself last year was definitely difficult but now this place has a good experience.
The squad is good and the boys are really enjoying it; they have got good training.
Hopefully now we can move forward and be successful, leaving our last session behind.”
Women are losing their sleep out of fear of this retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants clearly know what kind of care they need, some people were talking to their family members about it.
Nearly half of individuals across the country said they were talking to their partner about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they spoke to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them or take care of them, but they don’t take any steps to negotiate,” said Holly Cinder, vice president of life insurance business across the country.
Here’s where to start.
Talk to your partner and children: You will not be able to prepare to take care of your family if you do not tell them your wishes ahead of time.
Discuss with your advisor and your family where and how to get care, as those options can be important factors in determining cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also give you tips on how to pay for those expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy, to help pay for these expenses or to insure your own health, as long as you have the money.
Present your legal documents: Make your legal battle easier.
Get a health-care proxy, so that you hire a trusted person to look after your medical care and make sure that professionals follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate or negotiate.
Also, consider the attorney's right to inspect your finances.
You will choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and are taken to a hospital.
So will you be able to answer questions related to their medicines and allergies?
Tell that information in a written plan, so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just financial, but who’s the doctor?” Martin asked.

The victim could not see his assailant.
His wounds were not so deep, so the police appealed to him to be a witness.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city on Friday and the death toll is expected to rise further, officials said.
When the communication was closed, the rescue officers were unable to get any information from the Dongla Regency, the northern area of Palu which is near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongla, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located on the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami knocked, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongla is a regency on the beach northwest of Sulawesi Island, spread over an area of more than 300 kilometres (180 mi).
The regency has a population estimated at 299 below the administrative province, down from 200 in 2017.
The mainstay of the economy of the central Sulawesi province was fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Dongla.
Nickel mining is also very important in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morovali on the opposite shores of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, tsunamis have struck Palu and Dongla several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people lost their lives and hundreds of homes were destroyed due to the tsunami in Dongla.
In 1996, a tsunami hit the Western Dongla, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire from a seismic point of view and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Here's what's been reported about the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake struck off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coastline, half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of intense earthquakes also struck the western coasts of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A tsunami of magnitude 6.8 hits Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that exploded off the coast of the south, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake hits the region near the city of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit the area on Mentawai Island off the coast of Sumatra, causing dozens of villages to be destroyed and nearly 300 people killed in a tsunami that hit an area of up to 10 meters.
2016: A shallow water earthquake strikes the Pidi Jaya Regency in AK, causing destruction and stampede as it caused people to remember the devastation or devastation of the 2004 terrible earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died when buildings or buildings collapsed.
2018: Intense earthquakes ravaged everything on Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the island's northern side.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and rendered thousands of tourists helpless for some time.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of eastern Alaska ruler and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Pelin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, tampering with reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released by the state of Alaska on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman acquaintance tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, he took the phone from her.
According to the KTUU report, Pelin was sent back to the Mout-Su pretrial facility as well as fined $500 in unsecured bonds.
The network's report said he appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty" when asked for the plea.
Palin faced three A class offenders, where he could be sentenced to up to one year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with Class B offences with a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal cases have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was convicted of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Court of Veterans of Alaska.
In January 2016, she was charged with domestic violence, obstructing a report of domestic violence and possessing a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of experienced individuals in 2016, after her son's violent behavior was linked to PTSD stemming in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
With the death rate rising in the coming days, electricity and communication networks were also not working.
The earthquake struck central Sulawesi, the northeastern region of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos of the incident went viral on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, thousands of people had gathered for the beach festival in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the rare death penalty for a suspect in the NYC attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the rare death penalty for Saffolo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment to be awarded in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly uses a home depot rental truck to carry out a bike-infested attack on the highway path west of Manhattan, cutting off pedestrians and cyclists in October.
According to the notice of intent to demand the death penalty imposed in the Southern District of New York, in order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov has “deliberately” killed eight victims and “deliberately” injured them physically.”
These two countries carry the death penalty potentially, according to the court document.
A week after the invasion, a federal grand jury struck Saipov with a fork for 22 charges, including eight charges of murder to aid racketeering, which are used by federal prosecutors, especially in organized crime cases and in cases of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors said the invasion required "substantial planning and prior deliberation," explaining the manner in which Saipov carried out it in a "hateful, cruel and vicious" manner.
"Safalulo habibulavik Saipov injured and damaged the friends and families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clevus Enlor DiCat, Darren Drake, Ariel Allerge, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Ferrucci, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Pagunco," the press release said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The trial on the last death penalty case in the South District of New York has been going on for a decade.
Accused Khalid Brain was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were last sentenced to death in the New York federal case in 1953, a married couple who were found guilty of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Joanne Rosenberg was sentenced to death by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a local resident of Uzbekistan, had no glancing or remorse for days and months after the invasion, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators he liked what he did.
Saipov told officials that he was inspired to launch an attack after watching videos of ISIS meeting the crime on his phone.
Police said he also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22-counting offence.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, says he is "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We think our decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting life imprisonment without any possibility of being freed will only postpone the mental trauma of these events to include everyone," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be tasked with Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "collect an army of people" during the protest at the Tory Conference.
The Eastern Yukip leader asked politicians to "understand the scope" of Euroscepticism - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested she should negotiate with the European Union.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told a march in Birmingham that if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary, Britain would have been 'out by now'.
But the challenges faced by Mrs. May in addressing her highly divisive rank have been underscored by Pro-Remain Tory to add a different protest against Brexit to the city.
The Premier is struggling to keep his checker's compromise plan on track during attacks from Brexiteers, Remnants and the European Union.
The allies urged that she would try to reach an agreement with Brussel rather than a backlash – and force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr Bone said leaving means leaving the rally in Solihull, in which he wants to 'funk the checkers'.
She suggested that Mr. Farage should be made a partner and that he should be given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussel.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now," she said.
Wellingboro MP or MP said: ‘I’ll stand up for Brexit but we need to get the checkers out.’
Setting its opposition in the EU, he said: 'We don't need to be subordinate to anyone to fight a world war.'
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr. Bonn rejected all suggestions that changed public opinion after the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their views and that they want to stay is completely false.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkin also said in March: "I'm only saying this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Checkers are not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it because it is not so prevalent among our party and our workers who actually gherao the streets and elect us in the first place.
Please leave the checkers and start listening.”
In a focused message for Smt. I, she said: The Prime Minister retains his jobs when he does not break his promises.
Mr. Faraz said that the leaders of the rally should be made to realise the 'mahaul' if they cheat with the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter between our people and our political classes," he said.
‘They’re trying to deceive Brexit and today we’re here to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you run away by doing that.’
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: 'I want you to create our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit by understanding the atmosphere.
We are organizing the army of the people of this country that has won us a Brexit and which does not rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, Remeners marches from Birmingham before rallying for two hours in the middle of the city.
A gang of activists pointed to the tories against the Brexit banner after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour peer-lord Adonis pretends to have a conversation about security issues arising from the party app when the conference opens.
"It's the people who tell us that they can have a proper IT system for Canada, a barrier-free border, and a border-free free trade in Ireland and all the technology.
"It's a full swing.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren plans to take a 'strict view' of the president's operations
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will "strictly monitor the president's operations" following the election in November.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat or Democrat spoke about his future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
President Donald Trump's regular critic, Warren GOP state incumbent Geoff DeHale is seeking re-election in November, co-chairing Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
They were speculating that they could replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event at Holyoke was Trump's 36th meeting with the electorate using the Town Hall format since he took office.
One of the attendees asked if she was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to go and fix our broken government and include women first."
The death of LSU Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the murder of LSU basketball player Mad Sims on Friday.
The Baton Disease Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at 11 a.m. ET news conference or conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man they saw in the footage.
The 20-year-old was shot dead near the South University campus on Friday morning.
"Police chief Murphy G. Paul told Per 247 Sport on Saturday that he died after being shot in the head by Wade Sim."
Wade proceeded to defend his friend and was killed by Simpson.
On being asked, Simpson confessed to killing Wade Sim with a weapon there.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained by the police department of the East Baton disease parish.
A 6 by 6-foot junior who grew up in Baton disease, Sim played 32 games with 10 starts in the last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton ends world title after team's victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment it became clear that Valtteri Bottas deserved to play a big role in the team order race on Saturday, Louis Hamilton Mercedes.
From the pole, Bottas got off to a good start and knocked out Hamilton as he made his way into the first two turns and invited Waitel to create an obstacle in the drivers of his team.
Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton in the traffic behind the pack, something that should be decisive.
Mercedes was one lap behind and came out of the back of the Vettel but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw Ferrari's driver reluctantly leave free after a double-move defending on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place when he reached the end of the first lap by his 21st birthday.
He then moved on to a larger part of the race as he focused on changing his tire and quickly overtook Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally came into the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps, when Reconnen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day when Valtteri did a great job all weekend and is a really great gentleman.
The team did a great job getting one or two, Hamilton said.
It was a really bad move
President Donald Trump on Saturday falsely accused Senator Dianne Feinstein of lying at her request, not leaking a letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
While speaking at a rally in Western Virginia, the president did not address the letter given by Ford directly before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting on the current situation in the Senate, saying that people are “mandatory and bad and dishonest.”
"One very good thing or thing that can happen in the Senate in the last few days is when you see anger, when you see angry, mean and bad and dishonest people," he said.
"When you look at the releases and leaks and then they say, 'Hey, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Dean Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember his answer... did you leak the document – “Oh, oh, what?”
Hey, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
What we leaked... no, we didn't leak, he said, pointing to the senator.
A letter was sent to Feinstein back in July detailing the allegations made against Kavangua by the Ford and it was leaked in early September - but Feinstein denied that it had been leaked from the office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
“He had asked me to keep it confidential and I have kept it confidential as he said.”
But the president didn't find his rejection appropriate, who commented at Saturday night's rally: "Let me tell you it was really very bad gestures.
He may not have done so, but I have hardly ever seen such a bad gesture."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, the three women who have been accused of sexual misconduct, the president pointed out that the Democrats were using the allegations on their behalf.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary."
You see their meanness, dirt as well as that they don’t care who they hurt or who they’re running after to get power or power or control,” the mediator reported to the president’s words.
Elite League: Dundee Star 5-3 Belfast Giant
Patrick Dewar scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got a two-goal lead early through the attacks from Patrick Doer and Francis Beauvilier.
The Giant's lead before Mike Sullivan and Jordan Crowney brought home the home side level before Dyer was reinstated.
Francos Boshard equalised for Dundee before Lucas Lundwalt Nilsson secured the win by two goals.
It was Adam Keefe's third Elite loss of the season for the man who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
With the Giants winning the last three games, it was the fourth meeting of the season on the sidelines.
Dwyer's opener Kendall McFaul came in the fourth minute at 3:35, with David Rutherford helping Beauvilier double the lead in the next four minutes.
In the hectic opening period, Sullivan played his home game back at 13:10 before Matt Marquess came on equal to Cooney at 15:16.
Dore makes sure the Giants take the lead in the first break until he scores his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The domestic side is regrouped and Boshard once again brings them to the level period with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nilsson lead Dundee for the first time in the second period of the match, ensuring his team's fifth halfway win in the final period.
The Giants, who have lost their last five games so far, are now scheduled to play their next match on Friday at their home ground, Milton Kane.
The air traffic controller was killed in ensuring that hundreds of people could escape the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero or hero ever since he was killed in ensuring that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people could land safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi activating a tsunami on Friday.
The subsequent shocks in the area continued to wreak havoc and many people were trapped under the rubble in the city of Palu.
But as his colleagues were running to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonyus Gunawan Egang refused to leave his busy-controlled post at the Mutiyara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He was standing there to make sure that Betic Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could land safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to fall.
He later died in hospital.
Johannes Sirte, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take them from another city to a bigger hospital.
Unfortunately, we lost them before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts go out to him," he said.
Meanwhile, officials fear the death toll could reach thousands with the country's destruction, with access to Dongla, Sigi and Botonsh limited, the demilitarization agency says.
"The death rate may still rise as many bodies may still be buried in remains or debris, or in many places that cannot be reached," said Sutopo Ngueroho, the agency's spokesman.
Waves as high as six metres destroyed Palu, leading to mass burial on Sunday.
The Army and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances used to bring bodies every minute.
It is rare to find clean water.
Small markets were looted everywhere."
The head of the International Red Cross, Jain Galfand, told CNN: "Indonesia Red Cross is running the race to help the biologists, but we don't know what they'll find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking all of you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation or evacuation."
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia first experienced an earthquake in Lobunk earlier this year, killing about 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing since the Lagoon plane crash
The airline, which operated the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Macedonia, now says one man is missing after it was last reported that 47 passengers and crew or crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it could not locate a male passenger.
The airline said it was working closely with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline does not immediately respond to a request for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
When the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at the Chupacabra Island airport, local boats helped save other passengers and crew.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and all of them are now stable.
The cause of the crash and the manner in which the incident took place is unclear.
The airline and the US Navy say both planes did not land properly on the runway.
Some witnesses or witnesses thought that the plane did not land on the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jenn said the plane had come down too much.
"That's a very good thing," Jane said.
Jane said she and others were evacuated from the emergency exit on the sinking plane in deep water.
He said the aircraft's crew was panicking and shouting and suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve the pier also helped rescue by using a windy boat to bring people to shore in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water before the plane sank.
Data from the Aviation Security Network indicates that 111 people were killed in the crash of a PNG-registered airline in the past two decades but no one was involved in the Air Niugini.
The analyst described the time of night when the woman was burnt alive.
The prosecution restored its case on Saturday to re-trial a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlatt presented evidence for hours as an expert witness in the field of investigation analysis.
She told the jury how she had used cellphone records to bring together the activities of 29-year-old Muluzi Quinton Telos and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said she obtained location data from several cellphones, which showed she was with Talis Chambers on the evening of her death, refuting her previous claims, The Clarion-Lazer reported.
When the data shows that when he said he was with his friend Michelle Sanford, his cellphone was next to the chambers, police told Sanford.
Sanford came forward on Saturday and presented evidence that he was not in the city that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Talies was telling the truth, when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because his truck was in Nashville."
The second discrepancy was that Talis said he knew Chambers almost two weeks before his death.
Cellphone records show that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after the chamber's death, Talies had removed all of the chamber's text or messages, calls or contact information from her phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is set to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected to go to the jury to hear the case that day.
High Breed: What Is Conscious or Conscious Hip Hop?
The hip hop trio wants to change the negative scene of the genre by filling in positive messages in their music.
The High Breed from Bristol claimed that hip-hop had fallen to its roots to deal with political messages and social issues.
They wanted to get away from their roots and reawaken the popular hip-hop.
Artists like Fugees and Common saw a latest resurgence in Britain through artists like Alaka and Loki.
The second black person?!
NY Nanny sues couple after they set fire to "racist" text
A New York nanny sues a couple for partisan shooting after a mother complains that she is "the second black person" after texting her.
The couple denies that they are racist, prosecuting for "extortion."
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her disappointment when she found out that Giselle Morris, the new babysitter, was black on her first working day in 2016.
"No other black person," Mrs. Plasco Flexman said to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, it sent it twice to Ms. Morris.
According to a New York Post, after realizing his mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, stating that his outgoing nanny who was African-American had done a bad job and was expecting a filipino instead.
Ms. Morris was sent home in Uber paying for her one-day work.
Now, Morris is fired from the couple and demands $350 per day compensation for six months, in a live-in gig he was hired to start work without a contract.
“Look I want to show them that you don’t do any such thing,” she said in a post on Friday, explaining that “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple said on the claims that they were racist, stating that after insulting him they could not trust him, it was appropriate to terminate Morris' employment.
"My wife sent me something that she didn't mean.
He is not a racist.
We are not racist people," the husband who told the Post.
But can you give your children into the hands of someone you’ve ever insulted, even if it happened by mistake?
"Your new baby?
Leave it."
Like the "dragging" lawsuit, Plasco said his wife had only two months left to have children and was in a "very difficult situation."
"You're going after someone?"
It is not right to do so," said the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, there has been a quick response on social media to blame the couple for their behaviour and reason while silencing them.
Paddington publishers fear that the reader will not connect it with their own thoughts and opinions, the new letter suggests.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jenkel, who was born after the book was approved, said in the letter: "It's hard to think of putting someone in their place when you first read it before it's published.
It's amazing to know about the success of Pandington."
Describing his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book inspired by a small bear toy, he was optimistic about the rejection of his work, he said there were "both joys and sorrows" in the 60th anniversary of the publication of his book after his death.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a key member of her family," she explains that her father was proud of her potential success.
"He was a quiet man and not arrogant at all," she said.
"But because Pandington was so real to them, it was almost as if you had a child who finds something: you're proud of them, even if you're not really doing it to him."
I think he's seen Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his imagination and creation, he always attributed it to Paddington.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the work done by the doctors went waste.
"Nad was regularly saying it was really bad, she didn't expect that," said Mrs. Adnan-Laparus.
"Then Ned called me and told me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, son.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicine given by the doctors to beat her heart was gradually ending up leaving her system.
He had died a long time ago and it would have all stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it was all going to end.
I couldn’t scream, scream or do anything, because I was surrounded by my family.
I had to take care of everyone."
Eventually Mrs. Adnan-Laparus, who was grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers—who were unaware of what situation they were going through.
"No-one knows," he said.
"I put my head down and cried all the time.
It was hard to express, but I got to see a sense of extreme sympathy for Ned on the plane.
She needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Postcards of women suffering from suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide want to prevent others from losing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey post cards and phone numbers on the bridge of the Welsh with inspirational messages on which people can call for help.
Mr. Davis' son was 13 when he suffered from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mr Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said his son was a promising chef who spread his smile everywhere.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always used to say that her smile can shine everywhere.”
However he had left work before he died and he lived in a "very dark room."
In 2014, Tyler's brother who at the time was 11 years old was searching for his lost brother or sister, after which he committed suicide.
Ms Davis said: "I was constantly worried that there was going to be a cumulative effect."
Ms. Davis made the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend."
Don't sit still - you need to talk."
Ms. Hanfries, a friend of Ms. Davis's for years, lost her friend Mark, 15, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say anything that made him feel sad or sad or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we will make some changes in his behavior.
He was very sad on Christmas day - when the children opened their presents, he could not see them."
She said her death was a big shock to her, but they had to get out of her: "It left the family torn from the inside."
It made us sad.
But we all had to fight forward.”

Kavanaugh's future was hanging in the balance when the FBI began its investigation.
“I thought, if I can really find something that he’s been searching for – a limited-time and limited-area investigation – maybe we’ll be able to bring a little unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday as well as that he fears the committee is “broken” between the alleged partisan gridlocks.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
It was because of his lack of time.
The midterm elections were only five weeks away, on November 6 - as expected, if Republicans performed very poorly, they would seriously undermine their efforts in the land they wanted to live on in the High Court.
George W. Bush picks up the phone to call the Senator, propagating him to support Mr. Kuvangua, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him meets his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary or secretary.
What happened after the FBI submitted its report?
The Senate is currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear whether Mr Kuvangu could get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which Mike Pence, vice president, had to do by terminating it and confirming it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's Kim Jong-un 'struck down'
The number of North Koreans who fled to South Korea decreased seven years ago when John-un came to power, a South Korean administrator said.
Citing the South's Ministry of Integration, Park Beyonc<0xC3><0xA9>-Seyog said 1,127 people had left their duties last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the strong border between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by smugglers and gangsters were the main factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comment.
A large number of fugitives from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled to China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easy to cross the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers fugitives as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their country by force.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still technically in a state of war - have seen improvements in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries meet in Pyongyang for talks, which focus on blocked denuclearization talks.
This came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they widely agreed to terms of working toward a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for a lack of progress since then.
"Without any faith in America, there will be no trust in our national security and in such circumstances, we will have no choice but to first harm ourselves unilaterally," Mr. Rai said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "fun", saying he's not qualified for the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "fun" and said he was by nature unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
"I can't think a woman can even perform like that, they call it "fun," Pelosi said on Thursday, giving her reaction to Kavanaugh's evidence before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had ever sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes yelling and holding his breath while talking about his family and his school years.
He apparently flayed the Democrats on the committee by falsely accusing them of "bizarre and coordinated character assassination" by liberals who were angry over Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election loss.
Pelosi said she feels that Kavanaugh's witnesses have proven that he can't work in the Supreme Court, as it shows that he's acting against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements as well as the way he went to Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi expressed doubts that if asked, if Kavangua becomes permanent and if the Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives, would she still blame Kavangua?
"I would say that -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit for the Supreme Court, but being invited he can work right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat she was concerned about the potential rules of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because she is known to do conservative justice.
In the course of his certification, Kavangua evaded questions about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court decisions.
"In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh evaded questions on whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
And women need to shake it up.
It’s a religious instigation, months and years of anger come out and she can’t stop herself from crying.
Ms. Stamin told me 45 years later that “when we cry, we get angry.”
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
She continued, “A woman helped me a lot who works as an officer somewhere, who said she also cried when she got angry, but she has developed a new technique, which means when she gets angry and she starts crying, she will say to the person she was talking to, “Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.”
I'm angry."
And then she spoke.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed to flow out as part of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
An early job, one of my scariest memories of a male head office, when I found myself crying in an indescribable rage, I found an old woman holding my neck from behind – a pungent manager I’d always been a little intimidated by – who dragged me up the stairs.
"Don't cry in front of anyone," he said.
"They don't know how strong you are.
They think you’re sad and you’ll be happy to meet them.”
Patricia Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart on the presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an affair with someone other than the marriage in a boat or name called Monkey Business, and his name was withdrawn from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, who was highly disappointed, decided to run for president himself.
“It wasn’t a thought-provoking decision,” she said, laughing at me after 30 years.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called him "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was delayed, she didn’t have time to raise funds and so she swore that unless she raised $2 million, she wouldn’t run the race.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would only give her $250.
"Do they think I've got a discount?" she wondered.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she couldn’t contain the emotions — gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to raise funds and even frustration and anger at sexism from targeted voters rather than delegates — she suffocated.
"You might have thought I would have a nervous breakdown down there," Schroeder recalled how the press must have reacted about her.
"You must have thought that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember what they would put on my samadhi?

How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The initial salvo of a trade war between the US and China was supposed to slow down and while the war is still far from over, cracks between countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts said.
US President Donald Trump said the first warning was given earlier this year by imposing major sugar exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase this week with new tariffs affecting items worth up to $200 billion (150 billion pounds) is effectively taxing more than half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has retaliated each time in its own way, with the most recent slapping tariffs of five to 10 percent of the $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to match the US shot-to-shot and the world's second-largest economy is likely to shake up soon.
Getting back to Washington means hollowing out demands, but bowing head to the U.S. in public would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say Beijing could make its move, with the U.S. trade war positively supporting China over the long term, reducing the inter-dependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that either trigger the economic telespin in the country is even more dangerous than what the audience has actually seen before,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the center for New America Security, a think tank.
Syria is 'ready' for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria said it was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and was appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by a more than seven-year-long war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maulam said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All the circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees in the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that target their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people in the country are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualam said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries sponsoring the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup beating the US team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. now faces six consecutive defeats on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
When Danish captain Thomas J<0xC3><0xB8>rn's teen reaches the 14.5 points needed to beat the American, Europe regains its title.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled in the maximum tournament, showed his T-shot in the water at par 3 16th hole by accepting a match from Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds by becoming 1 of 4 players to score 5-0-0 since starting the current format of the tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5 and 4 by European team's lowest-ranked player Thorbjon Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Donson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Lan Polter, who probably played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the European to win every time in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop myself.
It was a tough year.
So thank you to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm so happy that I was able to help," Gracia said after Europe's win.
She tore the torch to her partner John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Wood 2 and 1 in a single play on Sunday.
"I feel extraordinarily proud to have beaten Tiger Wood, I've grown up watching him," said Rahm, 23, who was also a member of the team.
Wood lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
One of the greatest players of all time has won 14 main titles, second only to Jack Nicholls.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find a fairway with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Fineu, who played golf with the entire caliber throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his squad's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
In the morning we put some pressure on Europe.
We defeated them.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with America's PGA and Ryder Cup committee and move on with Thosm.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You should congratulate them.
We played better."
