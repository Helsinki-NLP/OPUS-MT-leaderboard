The combined incidence of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, has been increasing rapidly between January 1 and March 15, 2020.
The cumulative incidence of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing a similar pattern in countries in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries, even though the phases vary by country.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and in-depth medical centers should increase their preparedness for a rapidly growing number of COVID-19 patients, who require health care and, in particular, ultra-intensive treatment.
On December 31, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cellology were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a new coronavirus as a pathogenic medium, now called the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, was named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
So far, the evidence has shown that 80% of people suffering from COVID-19 have mild illnesses, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia and most of them have recovered.
COVID-19 takes the form of a more serious illness in 14% of cases where hospitalization is required, while in the remaining 6% cases the disease becomes severe which requires intensive treatment.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In these studies, we assessed the nature of cumulative cases of COVID-19 in each country in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with China's Hubei Province.
We also compared the number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with cases in Italy between January 31 - March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the UK and the EU
After China, there was a further geographical spread of COVID-19 and data on the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world is now following the situation in this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
Eurosurveillance 2020, Spitri et al. reported the first case of COVID-19 in Europe as defined by the WHO in a March 5 publication.
In the EU/EEA, France notified the first three confirmed cases returning from Wuhan in China's Hubei province on January 24, 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were reported in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported on 31 December 2019 and on that date, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
The number of COVID-19 cases and the number of cases
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) records COVID-19 cases from each country around the world, for which information is updated each day at 8:00 a.m. using official sources such as countries' health ministries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
This data is used to assess the nature of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them with cases in Italy.
As a sample of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative cases of COVID-19 cases for 14 days, taking into account the natural spread of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK over the period January 1 - March 15, 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of reported cases in each country on 15th March 2020 at 8:00 AM and compared them with the cases in Italy for the period 31st January-15th March 2020.
COVID-19 in the U.S. and Europe
The overall form of 14-day cumulative cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK is similar to that of Hubei Province (China).
In the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to rise around February 21 and then rapidly increase until February 28, 2020 (Supplementary content).
This mainly included the fastest-growing reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar increase in cumulative cases of COVID-19 (Supplementary content).
Figure 2 shows the combined number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to cases in Italy during January 31-15, 2020.
It highlights that the same number of cases in Italy had already been reported in 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK in less than three weeks before or at 8 a.m. on March 15.
The number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK is increasing rapidly.
The observed pattern in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 indicates that the pandemic is growing at a relatively rapid pace in all countries.
In addition, while different countries are at different stages, differences in national public health responses and possible definitions of different cases in countries and different protocols of patient choice must be examined to confirm COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described a condition that required intensive care for 10% of patients suffering from COVID-19, and media sources indicated that hospitals and intensive care centers in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
The data on hospitalization of COVID-19 patients in hospitals and/or intensive care centers is currently only available for 6% and 1% of cases at EU/EEA levels, respectively (data not shown).
However, they need to compile the current monitoring data in a systemic manner that will focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that there is a huge gap between the number of intensive care and moderate medical beds in Europe, which is 29.2 beds per 100,000 population in Germany while 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that other countries have fewer or more resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and moderate medical beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
The prevalence of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospitals in each EU/EEA country and the UK is associated with a <0x3E>90% risk of exceeding the intensive care bed capacity of the sample situation, as provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
As cases are still limited to certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the UK, and as hospitals and intensive care centers provide treatment to a certain regional population, case information and intensive care facilities should be made available within the definition of regional centers for the NUTS-2 level.
Italy's experience and current patterns in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and ICUs need to prepare themselves for the continued community transmission status of SARS-CoV-2 and for the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, which will require health care and, in particular, intensive care, as has been the case in the affected regions of Italy.
Rather than preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as indicated in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a fast, proactive and comprehensive approach to anaesthesia is needed, because if the implementation is not carried out ahead of time, the rapid expected growth in such cases will not allow the decision makers and hospitals to assess, accept and absorb their response.
Public health measures have also been listed in the rapid risk assessment to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Here is a brief period of opportunity during which countries can step up their efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, it is likely that health care systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a wave of patients who will require intensive medical treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been caused by severe severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world and has become a disaster for mankind.
SARS-CoV-2, like its gay virus, which caused thousands of people to get SARS in 2003, may have been infected with bats and exhibit similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, the severity and mortality of COVID-19 is lower than that of SARS, but the infection rate is higher and is more prevalent among older people and men than women.
This article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the research topic that is developing, in response to the growing number of publications on emerging diseases.
We have dealt with the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease.
Although many questions remain to be answered, we hope this review will help understand and eradicate this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 was unprecedented and unforgettable for all Chinese people who were asked to stay at home throughout the holidays and for many weeks thereafter due to the outbreak of a new infectious disease.
Since the virus is very homogenous with the CoV that causes the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 named it SARS-CoV-2 and the associated disease COVID-19.
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China, and immediately spread across the country and to 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had affected 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and 3,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is "the number one enemy of the people" and is possibly more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), within two months, more than 200 research papers on COVID-19 have been published which include its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first case was reported on 7th January 2020, through which the virus has been sequenced apart from various patients.
This review seeks to summarize the research progress in new and slowly evolving subject areas.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-caused diseases, Middle East Respiratory Diseases (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss what we have learned about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as urgent questions, even if there are some left.
CoVs are traditionally considered to be non-life-threatening pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of cold illnesses.
However, in this century, we have been exposed to the two most deadly human CoVs - SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an initial outbreak in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and immediately spread to other countries with severe pathologies and mortality.
So, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in the recent history of mankind.
As shown in Figure 1.1, clusters of pneumonia with unknown origin were first reported by the China National Health Commission in Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
The order of CoV was issued after seven days.
The first case was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the pandemic rapidly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, healthcare providers were reported to be infected with the virus, which could infect humans.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was placed under a complete lockdown and all public transport was shut down.
The first medical study on the disease on January 24 indicated that only 21 of the 41 confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was perceived as an early infection center from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time this report was published, the disease had already spread throughout China and to 50 countries around the world (Figure 2.2).
As the situation is changing rapidly, the final status and severity of the outbreak is still uncertain.
A multi-centre study on 8,866 patients with 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on 11th February 2020 has presented the updated picture of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 spreads to people of all ages, but mainly to people in the 30-65 age group.
Of those infected, half (47.7%) were under 50 years of age, the lowest was under 20 years of age and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0.27/100,000) than women (0.31/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread primarily to cities and towns in the United States.
It takes an average of 5 (2-9 days) from exposure to COVID-19 to diagnosis.
The average holding period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average duration from lactation to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The default reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people rose sharply before January 23, 2020, which coincided with a large pre-spring outbreak in China.
The fatality rate of patients with definite cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0x3E>60) and acute pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and covered viruses that contain a single strand of RNA.
They can be divided into four genes, that is, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to affect humans.
This overlapping spike (S) binds to glycoproteins its cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptide peptides 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then skin fusion occurs.
Infectious RNA genomes are released into the cytoplasm; after replicating the virus genome, genomic RNAs make virion-containing vesicles, including coated glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which are then combined with plasma membranes to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was recorded on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as a new type of beta-CoV with 99.98% genetic identity in 10 sequential samples taken from the epicentre of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in very thin areas of the subclavian artery.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 bind to human ACE2 more weakly than the S proteins of SARS-CoV, which in turn causes less severe infection by SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also produce new small proteins, which are encoded by orf3b and secreted by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in infectious pathogenesis and prevent the expression of IFN; however, orf8 does not include any known functional domain or purpose.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., indicated that the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution has been mixed with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the vibratory structures that were open and closed were fused together as dimmers, and that ACE2-B0AT1 vibrators could bind to two S proteins, providing evidence of CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug testing to overcome SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original and the average host
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans from caterpillars to cats and camels respectively.
The bats were considered the local host of SARS-CoV-2 after a historical comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs because the new virus is 96% similar to the bats bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21 with SARS-like CoVs.
However, it is unknown which medium carriers helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans, and the path of infection is still to be determined.
Ji, et al., has suggested that snakes should be carriers to reach humans from bats, in which there must have been a gay recombination between S proteins.
Researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that a long-nosed, ant-eater cat, which is widely used in traditional medicine in China, may be a potential medium host of SARS-CoV-2, for which 99% of genetic similarities have been found in the CoV and SARS-CoV-2 found in the eating cat.
However, the 1% gap between the two genomes is still a large gap, so concrete evidence is awaited for a conclusive conclusion (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in dry environments for up to 48 hours and can survive for up to 5 days at 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar effects.
It has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 cannot survive in ultraviolet rays and at temperatures as high as 56<0xC2><0xB0>C after 30 minutes, other than ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated disinfectants, parasitic acid, chloroform and chlorhexidine melamine solvents can effectively neutralize it.
In general, the entire human race is not able to cope with SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, there is no comprehensive study on immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
So, we can only refer to studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, when the virus attacks the host, it is first identified by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which include C-type lactine-like receptors, toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-lye receptors (NLRs) and RIG-i-like receptors (RRs).
The virus through different pathways induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and type I interferons (INNs), thereby limiting the spread of the virus and increasing the rate of macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help protect the virus from immune response.
Soon, favorable immune responses become involved in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8<0x2B> T cells directly destroy virus-infected cells.
T-helper cells produce cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell function by involving apoptosis of T cells.
The humeral immune system, which includes components and antibodies such as C3A and C5A, also needs to fight the viral infection.
For example, antibodies extracted from recovered patients have neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the over-reaction of the immune system largely results in the emergence of locally free cell groups that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in bad conditions can lead to various organ damage and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection that starts in the group is more likely to occur in older people with co-morbidities and pregnant women.
People who have other diseases or whose immune system is weakened are more likely to be infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with 3-7 days in most cases as found in the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and between 0 and 24 days.
As described above, a very recent study shows that the incubation period in the population of 8,866 cases was 4.8 (3.0–7.2) days.
It is very important for the healthcare authorities to combine the effective quarantine period based on the most accurate incubation period, which will prevent infected but symptomatic people from infecting others.
As a general measure, people who have come in contact with the virus or who have been infected need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Does it have to be 24 hours?
Fever is a major and early symptom of COVID-19, accompanied by symptoms such as dry cough, fever, muscle spasms, numbness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients may have dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the illness.
In severe cases, patients immediately have severe respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
The virus needs to be screened for early diagnosis of patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, whether or not pulmonary imaging is abnormal.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms were as follows: fever 98%, dry cough 76%, dyspnea 55% and diarrhea 3%; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Two recent studies on a family group and a group infected by a person with no symptoms have also found similar findings.
By comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required ventilation support, which was much higher than COVID-19 patients and was more lethal to MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also found in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it was found that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms, and about 14%-20% of the patients required ventilation support.
By February 14, when confirmed cases had reached 66,576 in the world, the COVID-19 fatality rate was 2%.
In comparison, SARS had a mortality rate of 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases as of November 2002.
For MERS, the mortality rate based on a demographic study in June 2012 was 37% of 2494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies had indicated that the RO of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the RO of SARS-CoV was between 2 and 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in respect of symptoms, mortality and RO is given in Table 1.1.
The data above suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV but is less lethal than both.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The collective beginning often begins in the same family or in the same ceremony or in the same vehicle as a cruise ship.
The patients have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or have been in contact with infected individuals or in the last two weeks prior to the start.
However, it has been suggested that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and recovered patients who have been discharged from the hospital can again carry the virus, which has been warned to extend the period of quarantine.
The normal or declining number of patients at the initial stage consists of peripheral white blood cells (particularly lymphocytes).
For example, in 1,099 COVID-19 patients, lymphopenia <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L with a white blood cell number that includes a <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L lymphocyte number and advanced aminotransferase levels and viresemia were found.
Liver and muscle enzyme levels and myoglobin had increased in the blood of some patients and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte layer had increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of the fibrin degradation product D-dimer in the blood had increased, and the lymphocyte count had decreased rapidly.
In most COVID-19 patients, abnormalities were found in chest radiography, and the characteristic of this is the bacterial patchy shadows in the lungs or ground glass opacity.
Patients often develop conditional pneumonia, severe lung injury and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive thickening severely affect the air exchange.
Disorders in type-1 and type-2 pneumocytes reduce surface levels and increase surface stress, thereby reducing the ability to transmit lung and increasing the risk of lung deterioration.
Therefore, the worst radiographic findings are often the most serious diseases.
The first diagnostic assessment of COVID-19 on 18th February 2020 showed that the desquamation of pneumocytes, the formation of sterile membranes and the infiltration of central lymphocytes and the disease causing death in the lungs of a patient with multinucleated synesthesia is consistent with the diagnosis and ARDS of viral infection of SARS and the same patient and
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse-transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criteria for diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate that accelerated the pandemic, medical disclosures for diagnostics began to be used in China on February 13, 2020 (which is no longer solely dependent on RT-PCR).
A similar situation had arisen with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of the history of the disease, medical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings are important and vital for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to identify SARS-CoV-2, in which, without the need for a wide range of tools using a dipstick, synthetic SARS-CoV-2 detects 10 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L of RNA fibers at 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L at 10-18 mol/L (inputs).
Hopefully, if confirmed in medical samples, the new technique can dramatically enhance sensitivity and convenience.
As there is a lack of experience regarding new CoVs, physicians can provide only supportive care to COVID-19 patients and see them using various treatments previously used or proposed on other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments including antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychotherapy.
Not only that, the cells of the recovered patients were also proposed to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are making rapid efforts to produce antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs expressing ACE2, such as the stomach and intestines system and kidneys, to some extent.
Therefore, respiratory failure and breakdown pose a major risk to patients and is the leading cause of death.
Therefore, the respiratory system must be supported to relieve symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen treatment, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technology that is used for fatal cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing secondary infection and septic shock and protecting the function of major organs is also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been known that the extra immune system response in SARS and MERS patients results in the cytokine storm.
Cytokinin storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines that include TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate the cells of the immune system to release a large number of free radicals which are the leading cause of ARDS and various organ defects.
Immunosuppression is important in the treatment of cytokine stormes, especially for severe patients.
Anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody corticosteroids and tocilizumab are used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storm include T cell-directed immune response, IFN-Y, IL-1 and TNF inhibition, JAK inhibition, blynetumumab, suppressor of cytokine signaling 4, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which can significantly affect the prognosis.
However, short-term treatment of corticosteroids in low to medium-dose doses is recommended for critically ill COVID-19 patients.
Till the time of writing this, no effective antiviral treatment was confirmed.
However, it has been found to be effective when given remdesivir through a vein to an American patient suffering from COVID-19.
Remdesivir, originally developed by Gilead to treat illnesses caused by Ebola and the Marlburg virus, is an extraordinary antiviral drug.
Later, Remdesivir showed potential inhibitors for other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Relying on this, Jiled provided these factors to China for testing on patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2, and the findings were very promising.
In addition, barycetin, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Concomitant treatment of lopinavari/ritonavir can cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The effect of these treatments on other drugs used in patients needs to be carefully monitored.
Production of plasma and antibodies from recovered patients
There is a long history behind collecting the blood of a patient who has recovered from an infectious disease to treat patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from getting sick.
It is true that the number of antibodies in the blood of recovered patients is higher than that of pathogens.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (IGs) that are produced by B lymphocytes and they identify specific molecules in the pathogen and destroy them directly.
On this basis, cells were collected from the blood of the patient group who had recovered from COVID-19 and 10 patients with severe illness were injected.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, as well as reduced inflammation and viral pressure, and improved blood oxygen circulation.
However, large-scale use requires verification and clarification until specific treatment methods are developed.
At the same time, some of the disadvantages associated with cells need to be carefully considered for therapeutic effects.
For example, antibodies can greatly stimulate the immune response and cause cytokines release syndrome, which is potentially lethal in nature.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the demand for cells to treat a critically ill patient is large.
It is difficult to rapidly develop and produce specific antibodies to fight the global pandemic.
Therefore, it is important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or test effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can quickly increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effect depends to a large extent on the combination of various factors in the formula according to the diagnosis of the disease according to the theory of TCM.
Most effective ingredients are unknown or uncertain because such ingredients or their optimal combinations are difficult to extract and verify.
As there is currently a lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the alternative treatment options for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from the severe phase.
For example, Xu Feng Jie do Capsules and Lian Hua King Wen Capsule have been found to be effective for COVID-19 patients.
Among the 87% of patients who used TCM for the treatment of COVID-19, China's various provinces showed the highest rate of recovery, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province saw the lowest rate of recovery (13%) where TCM was used in only 30% of COVID-19 patients.
However, this is somewhat of a rough comparison as other impact factors such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing only Western medicine (WM) with the combined treatment of WM and TCM.
They found that the time taken for body temperature to recover, symptoms to disappear, and hospitalization was much shorter in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most importantly, the symptomatic growth rate (mild to severe) was much lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM than the WM group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and even lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than the WM group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, for the effectiveness and safety of TCM, large-scale well-controlled trials need to be carried out in more centers.
It would be somewhat strange to characterize the technique of actions and to explain the components of TCM treatment or, if possible, their combination.
Most of the patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 experience a highly contagious or life-threatening illness, and people in quarantine also experience tediousness, loneliness and anger.
Also, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause anxiety and mental depression.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, emotional disorders such as persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic excitement, depressive symptoms, delusions, and suicidal feelings were reported.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak can make people more anxious about infection, isolation, and guilt in family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care must be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons and people in their contact as well as to the general public in need.
Mental support includes the establishment of a multi-disciplinary mental health group, accurate news and treatment plans for the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, regular and frank communication about the use of professional electrical equipment and applications to prevent close contact with others.
There must be effective vaccines to break the chain of transmission from the virus in animals and from infected humans to susceptible hosts, and the vaccine can often be used for anti-viral treatment to control the epidemic caused by the emerging virus.
Efforts are being made to develop S protein-based vaccines to produce long-term and potent antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-weakened vaccines for SARS were evaluated on animal samples.
However, before starting the clinical study, the candidates were given physical performance and lethal challenge patterns in older adults and the protective factors against animal-borne virus infection have not yet been explored.
This may be due to the fact that the effect of SARS ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, rare cases and some mass cases of MERS originated in eastern countries and continue to spread to other regions, indicating that animal-spreading sources exist in the epidemiological region.
Immunization strategies for MERS were formulated using ineffective viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, microbes, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits and some were evaluated on animal samples.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunologists is an urgent and important task for the current pandemic.
However, overcoming the problem is challenging as vaccines are needed for a long time (average 18 months) to develop and for the dynamic diversity of CoVs.
Due to the new disease, COVID-19 has just started showing its complete medical order in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can recover without surgery.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in severe cases.
Therefore, healthcare institutions need to build a diagnostic model to prioritize their services, especially in resource-intensive areas.
Based on the medical studies that have been suggested so far, the following factors may be associated with or affect the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
In a study of 8,866 cases as described above, 47.7% of patients who were over 50 years of age with COVID-19 were aged between 30-65.
Patients in need of intensive care were more likely to have underlying deformities and complications and were much more likely to be older than those who were not (at a median age of 66 compared to 51), which suggests age is a diagnostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2, as described above, infects men more than women (0.31/1,00,000 vs. 0.27/1,00,000).
Comorbidities and Complications: Patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care are likely to suffer from severe heart disease and heart failure.
Heart disease is also one of the leading causes of death in SARS patients.
It has also been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE-2 positive cholangiocytes, which can lead to liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to mention that the relationship between age and present disease is important and can have an impact on each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and is a potential longitudinal diagnostic factor for disease, response to treatment, and final recovery.
The severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been correlated with CRP levels.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the findings.
These hormones are widely expressed in various organs, especially in the heart and liver and in tissue damage.
Therefore, they are a traditional spectator for heart or liver failure.
Major medical symptoms: Chest radiography and transient progression of medical symptoms should be considered together with other problems to predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Usage of Steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are used in the form of supportive treatments for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
With high doses of corticosteroids being widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors have suffered from vascular osteoarthritis, including life-long disability and reduced life expectancy.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period of time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, many patients were suffering from extra stress during the COVID-19 outbreak because they had to live in isolation and in very precarious conditions for a long time and witnessed the deaths of family members and co-workers.
It is imperative to provide mental counselling and long-term support so that they recover from stress and return to normal life.
So far, according to demographic studies, the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic seem to be different from SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 can be replicated more efficiently in the upper respiratory tract than in the lower respiratory tract, and mild or no symptoms occur in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that can cause colds.
Therefore, infected patients in the early stages or during the retention period can produce a large amount of virus during daily activities, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, when patients are seriously ill, SARS-CoV is thought to spread, while most infections do not occur in the early stages.
As a result, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more severe than the SARS outbreak and is difficult to control.
A large-scale effort is currently underway in China, including lockdowns in Wuhan and surrounding cities, and continued isolation of nearly the entire population, to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions are causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining and the pandemic appears to be slowing down.
The most optimistic forecast is that the outbreak will end by March and the downward phase will last for 3-4 months.
Other experts, however, are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter has predicted that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini has established a pattern to predict the effects of the pandemic and suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group has indicated that SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the mid-turbinate and throat swabs of a patient who had been discharged from the hospital two weeks prior to his recovery, indicating that the newly identified virus could form a cyclical chain like influenza.
However, there are promising signs from China based on the declining number of new cases, which appears to have a positive impact on current policies.
Initially, it was estimated that Ebola would cause a million cases and five lakh deaths.
However, the disease was eventually brought under control.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, will weaken until it becomes ineffective and eventually vanishes or becomes a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with the SARS and MERS pandemics (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious by coughing or sneezing and can also be caused by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, which has led to a new possibility of infection from feces-to-mouth.
A recent study on 138 cases indicated that 41% of the cases may have been caused by hospitalized infection, with 17 patients having other prior illnesses and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, utmost care must be taken to protect human beings, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and so on, but also third parties who come in contact with patients or infected people.
The first step in reducing the risk of infection is to use face masks; surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series <0x23>1860s) both help prevent the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid points from potentially infecting individuals from reaching the surface of the material through the air, so that they are not transmitted to others.
However, only N95 (series <0x23>1860) masks can stop the respiration of micro-viruses from 10 to 80 nm, in which only 5% of viruses can be completely inhaled; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm in size.
Since the particles can also be accessed from five surgical masks on one side, healthcare providers who have direct contact with patients must wear N95 (series <0x23> 1860) without using a surgical mask.
Along with masks, healthcare providers must also wear fitted isolation gowns to avoid contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect people through the eyes.
On January 20, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered their bodies through their inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers must use a transparent face covering or goggles when working with patients.
The general public in the affected or potentially affected areas are advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, stay indoors for self-isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
Three feet is considered the right distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These actions have been considered as effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new virus in the human world, as recorded on January 7, 2020, since it is a homophobic variant of SARS-CoV, the memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak should have sounded the alarm in China.
However, even on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center was telling people that the new virus is less infectious and less reproductive from human to human, and it is not difficult to prevent and control the disease.
This message greatly reduced the sense of caution among the public, especially at a time when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival and Wuhan missed a critical time to contain the disease to a minimum.
The disease control agencies in China can learn from this hard lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these institutions should take the following precautions (1) to be more careful when making a public announcement because every word spoken by citizens is important and can thus change their outlook and judgment; (2) to be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information in clinics without waiting for formal reports from doctors or nurses; (3) to be more responsive to effective testing and responsive to the release of the pandemic rather than providing relief to the public; and (4) to put more restrictions on the public at an early stage to prevent the spread of the pandemic.
The outbreak of COVID-19 was caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2, which started in late December 2019.
By the time of writing this article, within two months, it had spread throughout China and over 50 countries worldwide.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 created a feeling of SARS returning.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important for controlling the pandemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older men and women more than young people, and the severity and mortality rate are higher among older people than young people.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
While COVID-19 patients infect the virus without symptoms, SARS patients do so only when they are seriously ill, making it much harder to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
However, patients who have recovered from the virus may also become positive again.
These findings have significantly increased the risk of the virus spreading.
These rapid advances in research on COVID-19 have not addressed many critical issues, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like CoVs, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
Which animal was the medium species to transmit the virus from the original host, bat or human?
Without knowing the answers to <0x23>1 and <0x23>2, we cannot effectively stop the infection and the outbreak can come back again and again.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical evaluations demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter the aerosol cells and then make a diagnosis change?
Does the virus also bind to ACE-2 expression cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically during an infection in humans?
Will it be a global pandemic, a SARS-like extinction, or will it continue to be like the flu?
The answers to the above and many other questions need to be found, but it may take some time.
However, no matter what happens, we have no choice but to bring the pandemic under control as soon as possible and restore our lives to normal.
The origins of the human coronavirus
For thousands of years, the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, has been fuelled by mutations and adaptations.
Before 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known to cause cold-like illnesses.
The outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Disease (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Disease (MERS) have shown how devastating and deadly HCoV infection is.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 brought the coronavirus back to light, and we were surprised by its high transmissibility, but its immunity was lower than that of its co-communal SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease and therefore it is important for us to understand the origin of the zoonotic disease of HCoV.
Most HCoVs originate from bats where they are non-infectious.
Parasitic parasites of some HCoVs are also known.
Identification of animal tissue for prevention of human diseases can have direct consequences.
The exploration of the interaction of CoVs in animals may shed light on important information on the CoV pathogen in humans.
In this review, we present a review of the existing data on seven HCoVs, whose main focus is on their history of discovery, as well as the origin and intercellular transition of their zoonotic disease.
Importantly, we compare different HCoVs from the point of view of virus development and genome recombination.
The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been discussed in this regard.
Apart from this, the need to successfully change the posture and the effect of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease has also been highlighted.
The coronavirus (CoV) belongs to the family Coronaviridae, which includes a group of ingested, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
The viruses that harbor the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases in these RNA viruses are called "CoVs" because they look like crowns under an electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have undifferentiated genomes that share the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replica polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, ranked as NSP1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome consists of ORF for structural protein, which includes spikes (S), envelops (E), membranes (M), and nucleoproteins (N).
Numerous genera-specific helper proteins are also encoded by different genera of CoVs.
CoVs are classified into four generations according to the sequences of different proteins (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV generation comprises the most HCoVs and would have divided them into four generations (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence shows that bats and rats serve as a genetic source for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main hosts for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years CoVs have continuously crossed the species barrier and have emerged as some important human pathogens.
Currently, there are seven known human CoVs.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing acute infection of the lower respiratory tract in relatively high patients who are at higher risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestation.
The first HCoV-229E mutation, B814, was isolated from nasal secretions in patients with the common cold in the 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 that produce self-limiting symptoms.
As such, there was a widespread belief that the infection caused by HCoVs was generally harmless until the outbreak of SARS.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most devastating outbreaks in current history, infecting more than 8,000 people, including an estimated 10% of crude cases.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a persistent epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula that spread rapidly to the rest of the world.
The 2019 new HCoV (2019-nCoV) which was later renamed as SARS-CoV-2 was the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which had killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm bells are ringing and the world needs to prepare for the coming global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven ACOVs have their origins in bats, rats or domestic animals.
Various evidence reinforces the theory that bats evolved from bats, in which the virus acquired the condition and is not pathogenic but exhibiting extraordinary genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented tremendous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
Tracking the origins of the zoonotic disease of the ACOV shows the natural history, force of movement and composition of the restriction factors behind the species' leap.
It will also provide guidance or facilitate the detection of SARS-CoV-2 shelters, intermediaries and amplified parasitic (V) hosts, which can play an important role in preventing its spread in the future.
In this review, we provide a review of the origins of zoonotic diseases, interspecies infections, and pathogenicity of HCoVs.
In particular, we emphasize and discuss the following general theorems that the parent virus of HCoVs is not normally pathogenic in its natural parasitic tissues but becomes pathogenic after interspecies infection in the new tissues.
We also reviewed the art of evolution of HCoVs in which the pathogenesis is reduced if the infectiousness is increased.
The impact of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was also discussed.
Animals have been known about CoVs since the late 1930s.
Before HCoV-229E pathology B814 was first isolated from the nasal discharge of a cold patient, different CoVs were isolated from various infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven HCoVs have been identified in the last decade.
A brief summary of the discovery of HCoVs in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and suggestive.
In 1966, the first HCoV-229E pathogen was isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infection, and since then the WI-38 lung cell lines have increased.
HCoV-229E showed symptoms of cold in infected patients, including headache, sneezing, sore throat, and fever and cough in 10-20% of cases.
In 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from a small rat's organ culture and then from a series of brain passages.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection were similar to those of HCoV-229E infection, which is indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinoviruses in terms of symptoms.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread globally and are mainly transmitted during the winter season in low temperature environments.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
According to a study on human volunteers, HCoV-229E has developed a mild cold in infected healthy individuals.
Only a few weak immune patients have severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as "Atypical Pneumonia", was the first properly documented universal spreading HCoV in human history and the etiological factor SARS-CoV, the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first case of SARS was reported in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases, including 774 deaths, which spread to many countries and continents.
Apart from the over-spreaders, it is estimated that each case can be caused by approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and the peak of the virus's effects may appear on the tenth day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV may initially experience muscle pain, headache, fever, pimples and chills followed by sore throat, cough and then respiratory distress.
Lymphedema, impaired liver function tests, and increased creatinine kinase are common abnormalities found in SARS laboratories.
Diffuse alveolar damage, cell proliferation and increase in macrophages have also been found in SARS patients.
Approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, the stomach and intestines, liver and kidneys can also become infected with this serious disease, most likely a cytokine storm, which can be especially deadly for patients with weakened immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the patient who had arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, there has been a steady stream of research on HIV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a seven-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found in children, the elderly, and patients with weakened immune systems.
The common symptoms of HCoV-NL63 include fever, cough, cold, and shortness of breath.
In another separate study, the same virus was isolated from the nose discharge of an 8-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it is found in the Netherlands, it has spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses and its highest outbreaks occur in summer, spring and early winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive urticaria, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
HCoV-HKU1, along with community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiectasis, is associated with acute asthma exacerbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is also found worldwide which causes mild respiratory diseases.
All four of these community-acquired HCoVs are well-accepted in humans and are less likely to turn into highly pathogenic diseases, yet, for unknown reasons, accidents can occur in more viral subtypes of HCoV-NL63, which have recently been reported to cause severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in China.
In general, when these HCoVs gain the ability to transmit efficiently and sustainably in humans, they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
Although most of the confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, close contact has resulted in imported cases of secondary transmission in various European countries and Tunisia.
The second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The medical signs of MERS are similar to those of SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
In contrast to SARS, many patients suffering from MERS suffered from severe kidney failure, which is very uncommon for MERS in diseases caused by HCoVs.
The number of patients who showed symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting was more than 30%.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases had been reported with a death toll of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to mankind.
From mid-December to the end of December 2019, a group of pneumonia patients with the previously known SARS-CoV-2 infection began to appear in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared an outbreak of low respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concern and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a crude case fatality rate of 3.4%.
The death rate in China's Hubei province was 4.2%, while outside it was 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 is caused by acute respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are caused by fever, cough, and bronchitis.
Some patients were also found to be overweight.
Pneumonia was one of the most severe symptoms and its rapid progression can lead to severe respiratory tract symptoms.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high nucleotide sequence homogeneity, they are different branches in the phylogenetic structure.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic, it is more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in asymptomatic patients and may have contributed to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other six HCoVs, there is a great deal of similarity and heterogeneity.
First of all, the boiling period and the duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this context, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trends of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and HCoVs from four communities (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
SARS-CoV-2 infection, on the other hand, is characterized by symptoms that occur during a normal HCoV infection, including non-specific, mild, or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 are also seen in the case of SARS-CoV infection.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 infection features intriguing patterns of both HCoVs and SARS-CoVs receiving from the community.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as that of HCoVs from the community.
On the other hand, it is yet to be verified whether SARS-CoV-2 has reduced transmissibility in humans, as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases have reduced transmissibility when transmitted to humans.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can also appear in feces samples.
It is to be seen from future studies whether the fecal-oral infection of SARS-CoV-2 plays the same role as SARS-CoV in at least some situations.
It will also be interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 shows fluency, as in the case of HCoVs received from the community.
However, after the spread in humans, the features of SARS-CoV-2, including communicable diseases, pathogens and sustainable spread among humans, will be effective for the eventual fate of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
HCoVs from all four communities that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived the ancient HCoV epidemic.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and those that cause severe HCoVs in humans should be eradicated.
In order for this to happen, HCoVs should be replicated in humans to the extent that there is sufficient accumulation of favorable mutations that would thwart the inhibition factors of the host.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people it infects, the more likely it is to be fully compatible with humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult to stop its spread in humans through quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, four CoVs from the community have been circulating in humans, causing people with weakened immune systems to get colds.
These animals do not need shelter.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not properly adapted to humans and their transmission in humans will not be sustainable.
They need to maintain and spread their animal shelters and spread them through one or more intermediate and amplifying tissues, possibly to a sensitive human target.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are similar in both SARS-CoV/Mers-CoV and the four HCoVs from the community.
At least for now, it's highly contagious like HCoVs from the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs from the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
They will continue to see if they will be fully compatible with humans without shelter or intermediate animal hosts and whether they will spread to humans.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be appropriate for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, habitat, intermediate and amplifying hosts of HCoVs.
An animal can become a precursor to the evolution of HCoV if it has harbored a closely related ancestor who shares a high homogeneity at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
In these tissues, the ancestral virus is often adapted and not pathogenic.
Similarly, the parasitic posture gives HCoVs a permanent and long-term shelter.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and the HCoV or its parent is the natural host of the virus.
On the contrary, if HCoV is cast into an intermediate host just before or during its introduction into humans, it does not adapt to the new host and often becomes pathogenic.
These mediators can then act as the zoonotic backbone of human infection and play the role of amplification backbone by allowing the virus to replicate momentarily and then infect humans to expand the scope of human infection.
An HCoV infection can be eliminated if it is not able to sustain its infection in the intermediate host.
On the contrary, HCoVs can accept meditative postures and not only that, but also establish long-term pathologies.
In this case, the mediastinum becomes a natural parasite.
Epidemiological data has revealed retrospectively that the contact history of the first case of SARS has been shown with predatory animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations showed that the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-IGG was higher in animal traders than in the general population.
In the live animal market, masked palm civets (Pagoma larvae) and raccoon dogs were first identified carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses that were similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly reinforced by the fact that no more SARS was reported after killing all the civets in the market.
However, it was also reported that most of the masked palm civets in the wild or in the fields not exposed to the live animal market were negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that the masked palm civets may be intermediate aggregators but may not be natural hosts of SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that 80% of different animals in the Guangzhou market had anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, so the possibility of different species of small mammals also working as intermediate amplifiers for SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of this seems to be the final resting place of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent discovery of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV led to the discovery of a closely related bat CoV, called SARS-related Rhinolopus bat CoV HKU3 (SARS R-RH-BATCOV-HKU3), which exists in the Chinese Horseshoe bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genome sequence of SARS R-RH-BATCOV-HKU3.
These and other bats share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homogeneity with SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for the new concept that bats feed on developing human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have been identified from bats, but none other than WIV1 has been identified as a living virus.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is considered to be the receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 was obtained from a sample of bat feces that was demonstrated to be used as an aggregator for bats, civets, and human ACE2 cell penetration.
Interestingly, the bloodwater of a SARS patient who had recovered from the disease was able to neutralize WIV1.
Thus, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats that share a 95% nucleotide sequence homogeneity.
Although there is a high homogeneity between these two viruses, it is generally understood that WIV1 is not the intermediate parent virus of SARS-CoV, and bats are not the immediate parasitic hosts of SARS-CoV.
Genetic analysis combines MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 and BAT CoV-HKU5.
Bats use CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV Posinda Grahi, Dipeptideyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) for virus entry.
The sequence of RNA-dependent RN polymers of MERS-CoV is genetically close to those found in bat beta-CoVs in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been detected in the wild.
The MERS-CoV and its closely related Bat CoV-HKU25 have only 87% nucleotide sequence homogeneity.
Thus, bats may not be the immediate parasitic hosts of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies conducted in the Middle East have shown that the Dromedary camels are seropositarian to the Mars-CoV-specific malignant retina, as are the Middle Eastern camels found in many African countries.
The living MERS-CoV is similar to the virus found in humans that was isolated from the nose swabs of dromadary camels, further indicating that the camels act as parasite hosts, a beneficiary of MERS-CoV.
It is interesting to note that normally mild symptoms but a large number of viruses have been experimentally identified as having taken shelter in infected camels by MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels not only provide shelter to the virus through respiratory pathways but also through a defecation-prone pathway, which is also the main route to shelter the virus from bats.
However, the question remains as many confirmed cases of MERS have no contact history with a camel before symptoms appear, likely due to human-to-human infection pathways or unknown infection pathways in which unidentifiable animal species shelter MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homogeneity with bat CoV RATG13 isolated from bats associated with rhinolophus.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is very good for determining the parent-child relationship.
This is to say that bats are not likely to be the immediate parasitic hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless the same bat-CoV is detected in the future.
Most of the SARS-CoV-2 mediated animals must have been from a wildlife species that was sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, with many of the early cases related to COVID-19, indicating the possibility of an animal-to-human infection.
Numerous recent research, based on the metagenomic order, has suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (manis javanica - mango cat) may also be the site of ancestral beta-CVO associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolins share the homogeneity of CoV genomes 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RATG13 in roughly 90% homogeneous proportions at the level of nucleotide sequence.
They group into two sub-branches in the genus Sars-CoV-2-like venomous genera, one of which shares the more similar mortgage domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, identifying 97.4% amino acid sequences.
In contrast to invariant truths, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are more different, although there is a higher proportion of genome-wide homogeneity sequences.
Recent research on sick pangolins also recorded the presence of a virus layer on lung samples, which was found to be similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted a different assembly method and physical curation to create a partial genome sequence of about 86.3% of the full-length virus genome.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is directly pangolins due to the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
Apart from this, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is also much less than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV.
The path of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be established.
While the RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins has the highest sequence homology, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest genome-wide sequence homogeneity.
There is widespread speculation that there is a high level of similarity between the RBDs of Pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and the selectively-medicated homogeneous evolutionary pathways of SARS-CoV-2.
There is an alternative proposal between the benefits of recombination of Pangolins SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs and RATG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widely spread across beta-CoVs.
The jury is still looking into the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Animal origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
Historical evidence has shown that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E originated from bat CoVs, while the parent virus of HCoV-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 has been found in domestic animals.
It has been reported that the bat CoV, ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) found in the North American tricolour bat, has shown close association with HCoV-NL63.
HCoV-229E, on the other hand, is chromosomally related to another bat CoV, named Hipposideros/Ghanaquam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, while the camels were suspected of being their intermediate host.
For clarity, the current knowledge on animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Evidence of interspecies transmission of HCoVs has been presented by genealogical analysis throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock in the 1890s, respiratory infections were reported.
The interspecies infection history of HCoV-229E is very less clear.
A bat alpha-CoV, which is closely related to HCoV-229E, has been detected.
One of them is an alpha male.
There is a lot of evidence supporting the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, are likely to have come into contact with bats in a shared environment.
Instead, they are more closely related to humans.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bats are isolated and non-infectious in alpha-CoV bats, while Alpacas alpha-CoV has been found to cause respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
Alpacas alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that the alpacas may have received HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be excluded.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hedra virus.
It is not surprising that bats can infect humans directly with HCoV-229E.
Alternatively, bat alpha-CoV is the genetic reservoir of HCoV-229E, with alpacas and dromadary camels acting as intermediate hosts that can transmit the virus to humans, as happened in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV has served as the best example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known for its early identification and its subsequent discoveries have also strengthened it.
It is apparent that bats provide a rich stock of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies infections.
The ideal conditions such as longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and flight-capability have made bats ideal as vectors.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has penetrated the dromadery camel for decades.
These camels have well adapted to them which has made them stable and natural parasitic hosts from the intermediate host.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Their transmission to a small number of humans is an accident and the human remains at the mercy of MERS-CoV because its transmission is not sustainable.
The role of the camel in the transmission of MERS-CoV is different from the role of pangolins, if any, in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2.
In particular, Pangolins beta-CoV is pathogenic in high amounts to pangolins.
They can be a stepping stone for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, just as in cases of SARS-CoV, it is.
Future research should consider or reject the vast potential for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, bats can be parasitic hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, which is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share the environment with bats by slaughtering them or through coal mines.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate amplification pathways that have recently been identified as SARS-CoV-2-related viruses.
The human contact of the virus was through slaughterhouses and hunting of prey.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
It is necessary to conduct a survey of pets and wild animals for antibodies.
Third, as noted above, the recombination and acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the third species that are in contact with bats and pangolins.
The animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 are still being investigated.
Apart from different animal hosts, three main factors are also important in facilitating the crossing of the barrier of another species, namely, CoV virus.
First, they have a relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
In comparison to other single-strand RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoVs depends on the stage of acceptance of CoVs by a new host, and the average replacement rate can be calculated as "soft" to "high" when there are -10-4 replacements per 2 sites per year.
The CoV has an evidence-ready exoribonuclease, which the deletion of which results in exceeding the high degree of mutation and also in impairment or even loss of vitality.
Surprisingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir is known to inhibit the CoV replication of these exoribonucleases and the inhibition of RNA-dependent RNA polymers.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents being tested in clinical trials.
Yet, the mutation rate of CoVs is about a million times higher than their host rate.
Moreover, when COVs are not well accepted by the host, the mutation rate is always high.
Compared with SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, indicating a higher level of acceptance to humans.
It may have already been accepted by other members of the human race.
This also applies to MERS-CoV as an addition to SARS-CoV-2, which is well accepted by the Dronedary Camel.
Theoretically, it is impossible that juvenile decompression will quickly make immunizations and conditions-virals ineffective against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, large RNA genomes in CoVs tend to pull in additional amounts of flexibility mutations and recombinations in the genome modification, which increases the likelihood of interspecies co-evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions become convergent.
This is supported by many other open read frames and by the protein actions encoded to the 3' end of the genome.
Third, CoVs switch templates between RNA replications at random and frequently through such "copy-select" mechanisms as the others.
In the tissues they act as a mixing vessel, strand switching occurs frequently during transcription of CoV RNA.
High-level homogeneous full-length and sub-genomic RNAs can be recombined to form new CoVs.
Genetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Viral-associated interactions in the course of infection
In addition to the three virus aspects mentioned above, viral interaction with the host recipient is another important factor that is influential in interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a sample example, which has also shown evidence of positive selection during cases of interspecies infection.
Based on the comparative analysis between the isolates of humans and civet SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV appears to have been rapidly adapted to different tissues, particularly at the RBD of S protein with mutations.
Normally, in the RBD in S protein, CoV is an interaction with the cellular recipient and is selected by the antibody response of the host with passion.
In SARS-CoV, RBDs are located on the S1 segment in the 318th to 510th amino acids, which bind to human ACE2 as well as their accompanying recipients for virus entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV allows interspecies transmission of viruses capable of identifying various animal ACE2 recipients, including bats, bats, rats and racoon dogs.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found to be isolated in the RBD between the human and civet virus isolates, and 4 of them are located in the recipient-binding image for interaction with the ACE2 recipient.
The K489N and S487T mutations in Civate SARS-CoV are in their RBD, which can reinforce the desire for the interaction of spike protein with human ACE2 recipients.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids may be important in virus acceptance for humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receiver with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein indicates that the mortgage wishes of their S protein may have changed with human ACE2.
Of course, a cryo-EM study has shown that the desire for these hostages is 10- to 20-fold higher than the bond between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be of interest to ascertain the requirement of any other co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
HCoV-NL63 may also bind to ACE2, but with a different S.
There are also numerous other HCoV receptors, such as Amino Peptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-Acetylsalicylic Acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful acceptance of these CoVs into humans after interspecies infection from their animal hosts.
As an addition to the cellular receptors, the effect of interspecies infection of HCoVs is also controlled by other nutrient-dependent and preventative factors.
Dispersion of this nutrient protein between the natural cumulative nutrients of HCoVs such as humans and bats, dromedary camels and rodents can be a barrier to inter-species transmission.
For successful interspecies transmission of HCoVs, nutrient dependence factors have to be strengthened and nutrient resistance factors reversed.
In this context, it remains for molecular determinants to be identified and their characteristics to be determined in this important virus-carrying interaction portion.
Using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR for SARS-CoV-2, non-prejudicial scrutiny of the genome-wide and inhibiting factors of nutrient dependence can be useful.
The emergence of new HCoVs: Going back to zero
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunity for the emergence of new HCoVs.
Thus, bat CoV acts as a genetic reservoir of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also lead to HCoV evolution and serve as two important stages in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to radically change the viral visualization.
In SARS-CoV auxiliary proteins, ORF8 is thought to be important to be adopted in humans, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses are isolated, but are found encoded by the haploid ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide removal of SARS-CoV has been identified in a gene that was isolated at the beginning of the disease in humans.
As it is deleted, ORF8 divides it into ORF8a and ORP8b and is considered an acceptable mutation, which promotes the migration of nutrients.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination with the genera of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, which contain large numbers of small recombinant parts in RNA.
Recombination locations were also identified in NSP 9, mostly in NSP10, and in parts of NSP14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the pandemic MERS-CoV has experienced recombination cases in different genera, which have been found in dromadary camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been identified in these other HCoVs, in which HCoVs are recombined with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
Artificial selection may also contribute to the unwanted replacement of the virus genome, which in most cases releases the virus from the selective pressure used by the nutrient immune system.
An example of this effect is the loss of full-length ORF4 and the removal of two nucleotides in the HCoV-229E prototype genera.
ORF4 can be found in bats and camel viruses associated with HCOC-229E, Alpaca alpha-CoV single nucleotide inclusion, which is affected in the frameshift.
Last but not the last, evolution of new HCoVs is also made possible by the pressure of selection in their parasitic hosts.
Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were observed when bats were infected with CoV, which indicates mutual acceptance between CoVs and bats.
It appears that bats have adapted well to CoV both physically and physiologically.
For example, a defect in the activation of a pre-inflammatory response in bats reduces the effectiveness of the pathology that is implemented by CoVs.
In addition, bats suppress the level of expression of low concentrations of fungal cell adaptive natural killer cell granules NKG2/CD94 and of the main fungal compound Category I molecules.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen type (ROS) generated by high-metabolism of bats both suppress CoV replication actions and affect the prophylaxis through exoribonuclease, thus providing selective pressure to the virus' genera to become largely pathogenic when ingested into the new host.
The more pathogenic CoV genera also evolved into recombination, which led to the acquisition of new protein or protein features to adapt to nutrients.
Thus, these three new HCoVs have not accidentally emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs cause non- pathogenic or mild symptoms in their parasitic tissues, such as bats or camels.
Those strong tissue replicates properly without removing the immune response.
Here is the secret of why asymptomatic carriers appeared and what is causing a serious problem in human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the high activation of the immune response and cytokines storm, while where the immune response is stronger, more severe form of lung damage appears.
On the contrary, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response from CoV replication is excluded.
In the anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment regimen, this can be a beneficial strategy to break down the immune response.
Interferon's response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the management of at least type-I interferon should be beneficial in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the NLRP3 inhibitory activation in bats is defective.
For this reason, the MCC950 co-administrator of NLRP3 inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern, through which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originate.
In contrast, 95% of nucleotide homogeneity in bat beta-CoVs was found to be shared with SARS-CoV, while 96% of nucleotide homogeneity in bat-CoVs existed with SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the presence of a host of viruses such as SARS-CoV, no intermediate sites for SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
The homogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 in pangolins beta-CoVs has been astonishingly found, indicating that pangolins may have functioned as one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolins beta-CoVs may have contributed to genetic fragmentation in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was either intentionally or accidentally man-made.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, CoVs have returned to the limelight.
Studies in bats and other animals have radically changed our understanding of the importance of the parasitic host of HCoVs in animal origin and human infections.
Evidence from the outbreak has shown that bats have roots in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, and that its transmission to humans took place through intermediate hosts.
SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and ud cats in the market, effectively ending the SARS-CoV pandemic by closing the seafood market and killing the ud cats there.
For the same reason, pangolins should also be removed from the seafood market to prevent zoonotic infections, given the discovery that pangolins are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, a multi-generational strain of beta-CoV.
However, future research has not yet determined whether or not pangolins and other mammals have contracted SARS-CoV-2 in humans.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in draughty camels for a long time.
It is an important mode of transport and has been the main source of meat, milk, skin and wool products for the local people.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
As was done in China’s wildlife market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for MERS’ control.
To prevent a repeat outbreak of MERS, a holistic approach to developing an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels should be undertaken, with the integration of other infection control measures.
Because we can't eradicate these viruses, new zoonotic variants can cause outbreaks.
In the wild, a wide variety of animal species, including chewno, are also moving.
In particular, bat CoVs are also in great diversity, along with zoonotic potential.
There are numerous opportunities for evolution and recombination in these zoonotic CoVs, which will result in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or fatal in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the order of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a good preparation and response plan should be in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They live in their own natural habitat until they have the opportunity to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics of spreading the virus, training people to stay away from bats and other wildlife species can reduce their contact with humans.
In order to better understand the life cycle of CoVs and their natural hosts, there is a need to continuously monitor mammals, which can be useful in preventing human to animal transmission and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent the zoonotic virus is to keep humans away from the ecological location of the natural host of the zoonotic virus.
Several pieces of the animal origin code of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
For the first time, if bats infect SARS-CoV-2's ancestor virus in pangolins, it will be interesting to see under what conditions bats and pangolins share the same ecological location.
Second, if bats have played a more direct role in human infection, it will have to be determined how humans came into contact with bats.
Third, if the third mammal has actually acted as an intermediary host, it should be clear how they interact with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, many mammals, including pets, should be monitored and tested for the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 being sensitive.
Whether it's bats, pangolins, or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 or their ancestral virus will be identified in their natural host in the future.
Continual exploration in this area will explain the important implications of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for the "suspected case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19.
On 6 February 2020, our team published quick advice guidelines for atomic therapy for the diagnosis of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and these guidelines have made a good reference for our survival and the fight against the pandemic around the world.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease. Our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the ongoing research discoveries and experience of clinical practice, therefore, the diagnostic and treatment strategy is also constantly updated.
In this letter, a comment on our guidelines has been made and the latest diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 (seventh edition) "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" have been provided by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China in accordance with the latest diagnosis and treatment.
In December 2019, the outbreak was caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which has been officially named as CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was named Civilian Accut Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO designated COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed Quick Consultation Guidelines and they have been published online in Military Medical Reservoir on 06th February 2020.
It has gained a lot of attention since its release.
Note that even though COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness-raising knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research discoveries and clinical practice; therefore, diagnostics and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, a total of seven editions of the Diagnostics and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the Peoples Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) during 16th January 2020 to 3rd March 2020 were published in some contexts in a positive manner.
Now that our guidelines have received comments from Zhou et al., they have submitted a simple score proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work has added new evidence for our guiding principles and has also made a valuable reference to this global pandemic.
We appreciate his work and thank him for it.
However, his work also needs to be updated in accordance with the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines of COVID-19 (test 7th edition) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspected case requires that any one item of epidemiological history feature be combined with two items of clinical invention, or if there is no clear epidemiological history, three items of clinical invention need to be completed.
Epidemiological history: (1) the city of Wuhan and its surrounding area, or a history of travel or residence in the area of contact with a fever for 14 days prior to symptoms appearing in the home, or a history of contact with a fever in the week prior to the onset of symptoms, or a history of COVID-19 in the area where such cases have been reported; (2) a history of contact with other cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (including a previous positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with the city and surrounding, or where the community.
Clinical inventions: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with an image characteristic of infection with COVID-19; (3) showing a decrease in the total number of white cells in the initial stages, or a decrease in the number of lymphocytes in the general population.
Diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases with either one of the following factors: (1) a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 or a negative PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 or a positive virology test for the known novel coronavirus; and (3) a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2.
As we can see, the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood sample was added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) frequency
The pathological identification of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and later in the seventh edition, serological evidence was added.
These improvements are based on the regular work of researchers, including finding the optimal nucleic acid detection for this rapid diagnosis, as well as the inclusion of a blood sample of samples from the respiratory tract, which has increased the availability of different samples, and are supported in the confirmed criteria to bring positive results of a particular antibody.
In addition, there was more and more evidence that reminded us to be careful with symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they are categorizing a person without clinical symptoms as "low risk."
There is also a need to verify the score system in further clinical practice and studies.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence will come to the readers for their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspected case" and "confirmed case", we should follow and follow the latest guidelines of his homeland.
Our team will also update our guidelines from time to time to offer assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, highest in a single day
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 in a single day.
The death toll due to the virus is the highest in the country so far.
As of yesterday, there were 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases reported as reported by Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR).
A total of 17 deaths have been reported.
In an online briefing, IEDCR Director, Dr. Mirzade Sabrina Flora, said the dead included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirzade, two of these cases were in the age group of 60 years, two in the age group of 51 to 60 years, and one in the age group of 41-50 years.
He also stated that two of the victims were in Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
Hospital officials told Edolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Maitree Hospital in Kuwait.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladeshi Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said that public transport will remain closed until this coming Saturday, longer than initially planned.
The shutdown was scheduled to begin on March 26 and would end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential commodities - medical, fuel and non-essential - is still allowed.
The first case of COVID-19 infection was reported in Bangladesh on March 8, which included two people who had returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
By March 3rd, all of them had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has crossed one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the number of total cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide exceeded one million, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia confirmed its coronavirus-related death.
North Korea on Thursday said it was one of the few countries to be free from the coronavirus.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization confirmed 1,051,635 cases, including 79,332 cases in the previous 24 hours before 10.00 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases were reported, of which 5,900 deaths were added.
CBS News, citing Johns Hopkins University data, reported that more than 1,000 people died in the U.S. on Wednesday due to coronavirus infection.
Across the world, strict measures have been announced to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, postponed the lockdown until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would continue to receive salaries until April 30 without going to work.
Portugal's parliament extended the state of national emergency by 15 days, with a resolution passed by 215 votes, ten dissenting, and one vote against it.
Saudi Arabia has imposed a full-day curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina: earlier, the curfew was only from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand has imposed a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeVine has extended the stay at home order until May 1.
In Australia, stores have reduced the amount of toilet paper per transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evenings. The ban on the purchase of its toilet paper by Australian store chain Woolworths and Coles has reduced the number of transactions to two and one package per transaction, respectively, nationally.
ALDI also launched a one-pack limit on Monday.
These limits are posted as messages on the checkout and on the chain's Facebook page.
If people need to self-isolate, buyers are stocking up again and again for fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited each purchase to one pack per order for home delivery.
These changes come after a four-pack ban on previous transactions introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 appearance, reported that there would be a four-pack ban, saying "many stores are selling out within an hour of delivery", adding that demand is "incredible", while ALDI, in their Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
According to a Woolworths spokesperson, there has been a "major increase" in sales in the past week.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the number of such packs to two last week.
To further reduce the deficit, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency. Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI made early availability for planned Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmermann, executive director of the Australian Retailer Association, said the retailer tried to increase stock, but it was difficult because of the local council's time restrictions on truck-supply.
They expect an increase in production costs, as suppliers have to meet the demand, and a lesser amount of specials.
On Tuesday, ADLI announced that due to early dispatch of the stock, some stores will not be able to run Wednesday specials.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retailer expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said stores were filling up stocks every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a large item, which leads to a small amount of stock in numbers, and, when sold, emptys a large amount of shelf space.
Coles and Woolworths showed the view [that] if there were numerous objects on the self, such as toilet rolls and sanitizers, and they were more numerous there, you would reduce the likelihood of panic, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said its stock has run out.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper who manufactures Sorbent, stressed that they are working 24/7 to keep supplies running smoothly.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that it was offering free toilet paper to some property sellers in Melbourne who bid first on its auction, when some of the auctions took place due to buyers having time off during the big weekend of Labor Day.
In Thursday's edition of NT News, Darwin included eight water inserts to be printed, cut, and used as toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia's March 3 report, the stores were originally against imposing restrictions, in which they said they had no plans to impose any restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmermann stated that there is also a huge demand for another product that includes masks, sanitizers, dry goods, handwashes and backs.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday evening, British online supermarket Ocado restricted the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12-rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term "global co-operation" refers to the extent to which a disease has spread rather than just how dangerous certain events are, the WHO has noted the need for governments to take concrete action.
All countries can still change the face of this global pandemic
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: "If nations respond to this, they will identify, test, treat, isolate, track, and unite their people in this fight."
We are deeply concerned about both the spread of dangerous levels and the serious and alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, this global collaboration is "unprecedented."
"No other respiratory virus other than influenza has been tracked since its origin until it became a global spread," he said in comments published in CNN in February.
Ghebreyesus expressed the same view, saying, "We have never seen a global pandemic caused by the coronavirus."
"And we have not seen a global alliance that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
The current state of the pandemic is in line with the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of global concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said about the outbreak, "It is certain that this situation will get worse."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there have been at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus, a global contagion to the 2019 (COVID-19) coronavirus, is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which causes severe respiratory distress.
The outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of global concern on 30 January 2020 and has been recognized as a global pandemic since 11 March 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, nearly 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in nearly 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 3,64,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is estimated at 4%, with the world in the range of 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress can be observed in cases of complications.
The time from infection to symptom onset is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific antiviral treatment is known.
First aid is symptomatic and baseline treatment. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering mouth while coughing, maintaining distance from other people, monitoring, and self-isolation by individuals who are suspected of being infected.
Officials around the world have responded by restricting travel, isolating, communicating, controlling workplace hazards and shutting down services.
This global pandemic has led to severe socio-economic disruption globally. Sports, religious, political and cultural events have been postponed or cancelled and there has been a widespread shortage of supplies, and it has been eclipsed by panic buying.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are either nationally or locally closed, and this has affected nearly 99.4% of the global student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been instances of fear and hatred and discrimination against Chinese people, other East and Southeast Asians, and those in areas with significant cases of the virus.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have come down due to reduced travel and closure of heavy industries.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported cases of pneumonia caused by unknown causes on December 31, 2019, and investigations were launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the wholesale market of sea food in Hunan, and therefore the virus is believed to have its origin in animals.
The virus that has caused this outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that is closely related to bat coronaviruses, cat-borne coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. The earliest known person with symptoms was later found to be sick on 1st December 2019 and was not directly related to the later weight market group.
Two-thirds of the initial group of cases reported in 2019 were found to be market-related.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report by the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case of a 55-year-old man from Hubei province, which was tracked as of 17 November 2019, may have been the first. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that as new cases registered in China decreased but suddenly increased in Italy and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number in China.
Cases may have been reported in much smaller numbers, especially in cases that showed mild symptoms.
As of February 26, young people had reported relatively low cases, with cases aged 19 or under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. According to the United Kingdom's chief medical adviser, Patrick Vallance, 60% of the British population needed to be infected before they could gain mass immunity.
The number of cases refers to the number of people tested for COVID-19 and those who have tested positive as per official rules.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and official policies of many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, were that people with mild symptoms should not be tested.
According to a study published on March 16, an estimated 86% of people infected with COVID-19 in China as of January 23 had not been found, and the unwritten person with the infection was the source of 79% of the written cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The primary estimate of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most of the people infected with COVID-19 have recovered.
And the time from symptoms to death in those who do not occur is 6 to 41 days, and most commonly 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, nearly 97,000 people have died due to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, 80% of the deaths were people over the age of 60, and 75% were people with pre-existing health problems, including heart disease and diabetes. Official figures for deaths caused by the COVID-19 pandemic usually relate to deaths that may have tested positive for COVID as per official rules.
In fact, deaths due to COVID-19 may be much higher, as they may not include people who are dying without testing, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Little information in Italy shows that the number of deaths during the global pandemic was 4-5 times that of the official COVID death toll.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that, “We know that [the number of deaths] is a low-stakes estimate,” a statement that is corroborated by incomplete reports of a decrease in the count in the U.S. Such a low-symptom count often occurs in the pandemic, as was confirmed in January 2020 with the 2009 H1N1 swine flu.
The first death outside the mainland of China was first reported in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia was reported in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside China's mainland, more than a dozen deaths had been reported each in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
Deaths were reported in more than forty countries and territories as of March 13 on all continents except Antarctica. A number of methods are commonly used to record the number of deaths.
These figures vary by region and time, and include the number of tests performed, the quality of healthcare, treatment options, the time since the outbreak, and the characteristics of the population; for example, age, gender, and overall health. The death toll ratio represents the number of cases that have been diagnosed in a given period of time.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death and case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
This number varies by region.
The death toll ratio in China decreased from 17.3% (1 to 10 as of January 2020) to 0.7% (as of February 1, 2020). Other methods include the Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) with the disease.
These statistics do not have a time constraint, and they track a particular population until the case is resolved.
Many educational institutions have tried to estimate these figures for a certain population.
The University of Oxford's Center for Medical Sciences, based on evidence, estimates that the overall infection fatality rate of the global pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upward estimates in this category are consistent with the first randomized trials of COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that analyses the impact of testing on CFR.
The WHO is convinced that this can be brought under global control.
The highest level and maximum duration of this outbreak is uncertain and can vary by location.
Macy's Bonnie of Penn State University states that, "If not checked, the outbreak of infection stops growing to a level and the host available to the disease decreases as it becomes available."
But it's impossible to predict exactly when that will happen."
Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, has argued that if all countries begin to follow WHO’s advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus, “it will end by June”.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine noted that SARS-CoV2 is likely to spread over one to two years.
According to a study led by Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, physical distancing and other measures "will likely be required until the vaccine is available (18 months or longer)".
William Shafner of Vanderbilt University has stated that "it is impossible to completely destroy this virus because it is so easily infected", so "it will become a seasonal disease and will probably return every year."
The toxicity or severity of the return depends on the extent of the collective immunity and mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are not comparable and do not appear in people who are infected.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Symptoms that are less common include fatigue, shortness of breath (cough), lack of sense of smell, palpitations, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea or shortness of breath. The WHO estimates that one of the six conditions is skin blue.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has listed emergency symptoms; for example, respiratory distress, prolonged chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, trouble getting up, and face or lips falling blue; it is advisable to seek immediate medical attention if such symptoms occur. The disease can further aggravate pneumonia, acute symptoms of respiratory distress, bruising, septic shock, and death.
Some of those infected may have no symptoms, no clinical symptoms, but the results of the tests may confirm infection, so the researchers advise that those who have come into close contact with people who are confirmed to be infected should be closely monitored and monitored to rule out the possibility of infection.
Chinese people estimate that the ratio of asymptomatic to non-symptomatic can be slightly as high as 44%.
The time of onset of the actual disease usually ranges from one to 14 days when the virus enters the body (the time for infection to show symptoms), usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the number of people with COVID-19 who have lost their sense of smell is estimated to be 30% initially and then dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being investigated.
The disease is thought to have spread mainly due to close contact and small droplets generated during coughing, sneezing or speaking, when close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
During the study, it was found that drops can travel from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet) due to coughing without covering the mouth.
Some have suggested that small droplets that come out of the mouth while speaking can also be transmitted by small droplets that can stay in the air for a long time. Even if the virus is not produced in the air, the droplets in the respiratory tract can form while breathing.
These drops may enter the mouth or nose of people nearby or may be drawn into the lungs with shortness of breath.
Medical procedures, such as intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, can allow the secretion of the respiratory tract to be sprayed more closely and thus spread through the air.
If someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth, it can spread.
Although he is concerned that he can spread by feces, it is believed that the risk is low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via feces or by mouth. Although there is a possibility of the virus spreading before symptoms appear and in the next stage of the disease, the risk of infection is highest in the first three days after symptoms appear.
Three days before the onset of symptoms, people have tested positive and this indicates that infection is possible even before large-scale symptoms appear.
There are only a few reports of cases that show no symptoms but are confirmed in the laboratory, but some countries have detected infection in the absence of symptoms when looking for contact.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control said that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person infects another two to three people. The virus survives on the surface for a few hours to a few days.
In particular, the virus has been found to be found on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, one day on cardboard and four hours on copper.
However, this can vary by humidity and temperature. COVID-19 tests for pets and other animals have come back positive.
Although British authorities recommend washing your hands after coming into contact with other surfaces that are likely to be touched by infected individuals, as well as after contact with animals, there is no evidence that animals can infect humans.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unprecedented virus, first isolated in Wuhan from three individuals with pneumonia associated with a group of cases with acute acute respiratory illness.
All the characteristics of novel SARS-CoV-2 are found in all the related coronaviruses that are in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies as its protective shield dissolves with household soap. SARS-CoV-2 is basically closely related to SARS CoV.
Its origin is believed to be of animal origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus forms a genetic group with genes derived from two bats, including the betacoronavirus, as well as the subgenus serbicovirus (Lineage B).
Its entire genome level is 96% similar to other bat-related coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference between cat viruses and parts of the genome sequences of human viruses.
To date, the entire genome has been found to contain 92% of the genome content shared between the SARS-CoV-2 and the virus, which is insufficient to prove that the parasites are the mediator hosts.
The virus can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, but it is confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of the infected practice.
A comparative study of PCR and CT conducted in Wuhan suggests that CT, although less accurate, is significantly more sensitive than PCR and that many of its imaging features are compatible with other pneumonias and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT should not be used or used as a first test to diagnose COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued several rules for RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was issued on January 17.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on a respiratory tract or blood sample.
Results can usually be available in a few hours.
Usually, this test is done by taking a secretion sample of the upper part of the back of the nose, but a secretion sample can also be used. Many laboratories and companies are developing blood-resistant tests.
As on 6th April 2020, none of these tests were proven accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
A blood test developed by Seloxin in the U.S. has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The typical image characteristics of people who have no symptoms, such as radiographs and computed tomography (CT), include unauthentic peripheral ground glass opacity and no pluril fusion.
The international online information on imaging findings of confirmed cases is being compiled by the Italian Radiological Society.
It is less accurate to use imaging in detecting COVID-19 without confirmation of PCR due to the combination with an infection such as adenovirus.
In a large study in China, chest CT results were compared to PCR and showed that although imaging was less accurate for detecting infection, it was faster and more sensitive and suggested that it should be considered as a means of investigation in areas where the pandemic had spread.
Convolutional neural networks, including radiographs and CTs based on artificial intelligence, have been developed to detect the virus's image characteristics.
To prevent the spread of the disease, plans include maintaining good personal health, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth, using tissue while coughing or sneezing, and putting tissue directly into the trash.
Those who have already been infected are advised to wear a surgical mask in public places.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent infection. Many governments have restricted or advised against travel to other parts of the country from areas where outbreaks have occurred.
However, the virus has reached the level of social spread in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community and some sections of the society do not know when and where they got the infection. Health care providers who are caring for an infected person are recommended to take standard precautions, contact precautions and eye care. Tracking contacts is an important method for health authorities to track the source of infection and prevent further infection.
The use of location information by governments through mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about private life and Amnesty International and 100 other organisations have issued a statement regarding the restriction on such surveillance.
Many mobile apps have been implemented or suggested for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, a group of more than a dozen experts were working on alternatives such as using Bluetooth to log in with other cellphones to maintain user privacy.
Then users get a message if they come in close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misunderstandings are spreading about the prevention of infection, for example, cleaning the nose and swallowing are not effective.
There is no vaccine available for COVID-19, many organizations are trying to develop a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially when going to the toilet or if their hands look dirty, before eating and after sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus dies with household soap because the household soap breaks its protective covering.
If water and soap dispensers are not available, the CDC still recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.
It is recommended not to touch your eyes, nose, or mouth without washing your hands.
Many solutions, such as 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hydrochloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% povidone-iodine, can eliminate surface contamination (Stainless steel surface can be disinfected using only one minute disinfectant).
Other drugs, such as benzalkonium and chroxidine, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 in a place such as a kitchen or nursery, all tablets, touch screens, remote controls and devices such as ATM machines used by sick persons in such areas should be disinfected.
Health agencies recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a folded elbow or tissue while coughing or sneezing and dispose of the tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who are likely to be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the amount of droplets that are spread by breathing while speaking, sneezing, or coughing.
The WHO has issued guidelines on how and when to wear a mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, wearing a mask is likely to reduce people's tendency to put on their face, which is a major source of infection if their hands are not healthy. But masks have been recommended for those who care about those who are likely to have the disease.
The WHO recommends wearing a mask only if healthy people are at risk, for example those who are caring for people infected with COVID-19, also acknowledging that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have begun to encourage the general public to wear masks.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of cloth-made non-medical masks. China recommends the use of disposable medical masks especially for healthcare providers in public, especially in close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends the use of surgical masks when using public transport or in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from wearing masks in public or from going out without covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam urged everyone to wear a face mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory to wear a face mask when going to grocery stores.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan has made it mandatory for passengers to wear face masks on trains and intercity buses every day since mid-March.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask when going out and recommended that those who cannot afford face masks should make masks at home.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves measures to control the spread of infection that are aimed at minimizing the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
The practices include quarantine, travel restrictions and closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shopping centres.
People can practice social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, not touching while greeting and maintaining physical distance from others.
Many governments have ordered or recommended social distancing in areas where there have been outbreaks.
U.S. government agencies and the Department of Health have slashed the maximum number of people coming together from 250 people (unless the spread of COVID-19 in that province is known) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
As of 22 March 2020, Germany has banned gatherings of more than two people in public places. Older people and those who have medical restrictions in places where social outbreaks occur, such as diabetes, heart disease, government disorders, high blood pressure and compromised immune systems. The WHO is advising such individuals to stay at home "with the aim of maintaining social distancing" as it faces the increasing risk of serious illness and disorder.
The use of the term "social distancing" had the effect of encouraging people to stay in touch with each other socially, rather than completely isolating themselves in alternative ways. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines during this global pandemic.
This includes recommendations to have sex with someone you live with and who has not been infected with the virus or has no symptoms of the virus.
Those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and are suspected to have been infected are recommended to self-quarantine at home.
Health institutions have given appropriate instructions on how to self-isolate, and many governments have ordered or recommended isolating the entire population living in areas where there has been an infection.
Stricter self-isolation has been recommended for those in high-risk groups.
Those who are likely to have come in contact with a person infected with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a widely-infected country or region are advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the last time they come in contact.
Prevention or prevention of spread and mitigation of spread are the measures to control the outbreak.
Preventing the spread is done in the early stages of the outbreak and is aimed at tracking those who have been infected, isolating them, as well as planning infection control measures and vaccinating other populations to prevent the spread of the disease.
When it is not possible to prevent the spread of disease, steps are taken towards eradicating the disease: measures are taken to slow down the pace of spread and measures are taken to reduce the health system and its impact on society.
Both measures can be combined to prevent the spread and reduce the spread.
To prevent the spread, more extreme measures have to be taken to reverse the global pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. As part of the planning of infectious disease attempts to reduce the severity of the spread which is called flattening of the spread graph.
They reduce the risk of stress on health services and give time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-medical preventive measures that can manage the outbreak include hand hygiene, wearing face masks and self-isolation, closing schools, banning large-scale gatherings. Stricter measures aimed at physical distancing, including stricter restrictions, to encourage and involve the community in recognizing such interventions. Social measures aimed at social distancing, as well as complete personal preventive measures such as surface cleaning related to the environment around the outbreak, may be included.
Other countries have also adopted various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has begun large-scale testing and local self-isolation, and warned to be vigilant about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those who were self-isolating and penalised those who could not.
Taiwan has ramped up the production of face masks and imposed penalties for stockpiling medical equipment. Following the example of Great Britain and the United States, there are major challenges in curbing the spread of the disease (decreasing the spread of the pandemic, not stopping) and preventing (reversing the growth of the epidemic).
Favorable plans to reduce the spread of the disease can reduce the high demand for healthcare by 2/3 and the deaths can be halved but still lead to thousands of deaths and huge stress on the health system.
Preventing or suppressing the spread may be a priority but it needs to be maintained consistently as long as the virus is circulating in the human community (or until a vaccine is available, if it happened before), otherwise the infection spreads again quickly after the measures are relaxed.
Overtime interventions to prevent or suppress the spread of the pandemic cause economic and social harm.
There are no specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19 but efforts are underway to develop one that includes testing of available drugs.
Taking cold medicines, drinking fluids and taking rest can help reduce symptoms.
The need for oxygen treatment, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support can be felt as intense.
The use of steroids can worsen the effects.
Several compounds that have been previously approved to treat other viral diseases are being researched to treat COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has also said that "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Capacity building and optimizing healthcare for COVID-19 patients are the basic measures to respond to the outbreak, the WHO said.
The European Zonal Office of the ECDC and WHO has issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare providers to take the available resources to various levels, including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 tests, eliminating alternative methods if possible, isolation of COVID-19 positive patients, and training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are many theories as to where the first case (the so-called zero number patient) might have been found.
The first case of the novel coronavirus can be traced back to Wuhan, Hubei, China on 1 December 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
They were mostly related to the wholesale market of Hunan sea food, in which living animals were also sold, and one theory is that this virus came from similar animals or in other words, the origin of this virus. A group of pneumonia patients from unknown causes was found on December 26, and it was treated on December 27 in the Hubei Provincial Hospital by Dr. Zhang Jishiyan.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about the "SARS-type coronavirus."
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenling, had been warned by the police about spreading false rumors, and another, Mother Fen, had been warned by her superiors about such warnings.
The Wuhan Municipal Commission later issued a notice to the public and informed the WHO.
Many cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan, which began investigations in early January, with cases doubling about every seven and a half days in the early stages of the outbreak.
The virus spread to other provinces of China in early January and mid-January 2020 due to the migration caused by the Chinese New Year and Wuhan being the major transportation hub and railway change point or junction.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The latter official data shows that by 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already started showing symptoms. As of 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy in terms of the world's highest confirmed cases. As of 9 April 2020, 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
At least one case has been reported in nearly 200 countries and territories.
As a result of the global pandemic, many countries in the Schengen area have imposed restrictions on free movement and have controlled borders.
National responses include measures to contain the spread (stay at home orders, stay-at-home orders and lockdowns) and lockdowns. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people in the United States, or 90% of the population, are in some form of lockdown, more than 50 million people in the Philippines are in lockdown, nearly 59 million people in South Africa are in lockdowns, and 1.3 million people are in lockdowns in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were under some form of lockdown, a number that rose to 2.6 billion in two days - a figure that is one-third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan before December 1, 2019, with one unconfirmed case reported on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jissian found a group of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on December 26, after which his hospital informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Early genetic tests of a sample of patients on December 27 showed the existence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued an advisory to the public.
He was informed on the same day.
As the incident took place, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police to spread false rumors about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission said there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission.
In the days following January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that Xi Jinping, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, later described as a "people's war" to contain the spread of the virus.
The sanitization chain, which is described as the "biggest quarantine in human history," was announced on January 23, halting travel in and out of Wuhan, which was later expanded to a total of 15 cities in Hubei that affected 57 million people.
Private vehicles have been banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations have been canceled in many places.
The officials also announced the construction of a temporary hospital called Hushenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
A new hospital has been built to accommodate more patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has converted other places in Wuhan such as conference centers and sports grounds into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government took further measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including health announcements for travelers and extending spring vacations.
Schools and universities in the country were closed.
A number of measures were taken in the Hong Kong and Macau regions, especially in respect of schools and universities.
Work has been carried out in many parts of China.
Travel restrictions have been imposed on both indoor and outdoor travel.
The public transport system was changed and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
Public movements were brought under control in many cities and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) were exposed to restrictions on outside movement. When the outbreak reached the global level in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from spreading to China from other countries.
Beijing, for example, made 14 days of quarantine mandatory for all international travellers arriving in the city. On March 23, there was only one case of local infection five days ago on the mainland of China, which was a passenger from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiangani reported that the spread of locally transmitted cases had stopped and the outbreak in China had been brought under control.
On the same day in Hubei, in addition to Wuhan, the travel restrictions were relaxed two months after the lockdown was imposed. On March 26, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the validity of visa or resident license holders would be suspended after March 28, and did not give any specific details on when the suspension plan would end.
Those who want to go to China will have to apply to the Chinese Embassy or Consulate.
The Chinese government on March 30 encouraged businesses and factories to reopen and offered financial assistance to industries. The State Committee announced a three-minute silence across the country on April 4 at 10 a.m. to begin the mourning day. Although the same day is the Qingming festival, the central government asked families to express their faith online so that physical distancing does not lead to a resurgence of COVID-19.
On January 20, 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 has spread from China to South Korea.
The country's health agency reported a major increase in confirmed cases on February 20, with the rise largely attributed to the assembly of the new religious movement, the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, in Degu.
The outbreak was suspected to have been caused by devotees of Shincheonji who visited Wuhan Degu.
As of 22 February, 1261 of the church's 9336 followers, i.e. approximately 13%, showed symptoms. South Korea issued the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.
Korea reported more than 2,000 cases on February 28, rising to 3150 as of February 29.
All military bases in South Korea have been quarantined after three personnel tested positive for the virus.
The flight schedules were also affected as they were changed. South Korea launched the world's largest and most well-planned programme to test the virus on a large population, isolate, track and isolate those who have come in contact with it.
The modes of testing include self-monitoring of symptoms by a mobile application from abroad, taking drive-through tests for the virus i.e., not disembarking from the vehicle, getting results the next day and increasing the testing capacity so that 20,000 people can be tested daily.
South Korea's program is considered successful in controlling outbreaks without isolating entire cities. Initially, President Moon Jae-in was polarized by South Korean society in response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to impeach or praise Moon for his handling of the outbreak in the wrong way by the government.
In South Korea, it was reported that the lowest number of cases reported in a single day in four weeks was on March 23.
On March 29, it was stated that from April 1, all those coming from abroad will be quarantined for two weeks.

Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak and that only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans were announced to limit travel between cities, but until after the Persian New Year Navroz, large-scale traffic continued between the cities.
The holy shrine of Shias in Qom was open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. In February, Iran became a hub for the spread of the virus after China.
During claims to cover the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries withdrew their cases to Iran by February 28, suggesting that the outbreak was more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to that date.
Iran's parliament was closed on March 3 after 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus.
On March 12, the Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prison authorities to release those detained for peaceful dissent who resisted human rights abuses without any conditions and similarly temporarily release other eligible prisoners.
He also said that in closed institutions such as detention centres, where there is also a lack of adequate medical services, the risk of spreading the virus is high.
On March 15, the Iranian government announced that 100 people had died in a single day, the country's highest number since the outbreak began.
By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died.
As of March 23, Iran had reported 50 new cases per hour and one death every 10 minutes.
According to a WHO official, there may be more than five cases reported in Iran.
It is also being suggested that the sanctions imposed by the US on Iran may affect the economic ability of that country to cope with the outbreak of the virus.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for a relaxation of economic sanctions on other countries, including Iran, which has been hit hardest by the global pandemic.
The outbreak was confirmed in Italy on January 31, when two Chinese passengers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
As cases grew rapidly, the Italian government had to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
In Lombardy, a cluster of unrelated COVID-19 cases was detected on 21 February after 16 confirmed cases were detected. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new Decree Exemption Act to contain the outbreak that included isolating more than 50,000 people in 11 different municipalities in the northern part of Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "The areas that have been evacuated will not be allowed to enter or exit."
Work activities and sporting events have already been ordered to be suspended in the area. "On March 4, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities in Italy due to 100 deaths."
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were scheduled to be held in closed ground until April, but all sporting events were suspended for at least a month on March 9.
On March 11, Prime Minister Kante ordered the closure of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and drugstores. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Infectious Diseases (SIAARTI) published the recommended medical guidelines for treatment.

Italy had 12,8948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recoveries as of April 5, most of them in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report suggested that Italy's large population of older people and the inability to test all those who have been infected with the virus to date could lead to a higher mortality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus appeared to be the mildest of any other infected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or population quarantine on its citizens.
As a result, the government was criticized for failing to recognize the speed and intensity of responding to the problems people were facing. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a proclamation and advised people to avoid all non-essential travel and social connections, to work from home when possible and avoid places such as liquor stores, restaurants, and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all places of entertainment, such as bars and gymnasiums, should be closed as soon as possible and promised to pay 80% of the wages of workers to the limit of <0xC2><0xA3>2500 per month to avoid unemployment during the crisis. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced a ban on gatherings of more than two people, restrictions on travel and on outdoor work only as necessary. Such strict social distancing measures were put in place.
This is different from the previous measures, which could have forced the police to punish and disperse the assembled people.
Most businesses were ordered to close, with the exception of businesses considered "essential" that included supermarkets, medical shops, hardware stores, petrol pumps, and garages.

Despite this, the true extent of the outbreak at the time was unclear as the rate of testing in the United States was low.
The tests were marred by faulty testing materials made by the federal government in February, non-governmental testing materials (made by educational institutions, companies and hospitals) not being approved by the federal government until the end of February, and people having restrictive criteria by the beginning of March to be eligible to be tested (after a doctor's order became necessary).

The WHO appreciated the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and preventing the epidemic.
The WHO reported a gap in the SARS outbreak between 2002-2004 when Chinese officials were accused of secrecy that hampered efforts to contain the disease by preventing it and the current crisis where the central government provided regular information to avoid panic in the face of the solar New Year.
In response to the central authorities' decision to impose a travel ban in Wuhan on January 23, WHO representative Goden went on to say that this was not the first time that the WHO had announced a global health emergency, and that this was a sign of a commitment to co-occurrence after the outbreak of the pandemic was the highest in the world, and that this was the "unprecedented event in the history of human-to-human transmission in China" on January 30.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that PHEIC is due to the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries where health systems are not capable.
Responding to travel restrictions, Tedros said there was "no need to take unnecessary measures that interfere with international travel and trade" and that "the WHO does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement."
On February 5, the WHO called for $675 million in funding for planned preparedness in low-income countries to help countries that do not yet have a system to detect people infected with the virus.
Tedros further declared that "we are as strong as our weakest chain" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more tomorrow".The WHO named the disease COVID-19 at a press conference on February 11.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has agreed to give the power of the entire UN system to respond.
As a result, a UN Crisis Management Group was activated and allowed to coordinate the response of the entire United Nations, which the WHO says will allow them to focus on health response and use other agencies to bear the impact of their expertise on a much broader social, economic and development.
On 14 February, a joint group with China, led by WHO, began to provide international and WHO experts to help local management of the virus in China, even though it is the only country that is ready to assess the severity of the disease and the extent of the infection by holding a workshop and meeting with national-level institutions to assess the impact of the pandemic on the region and the country's response to urban and rural practices.
In response to the outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission group to investigate the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said that the global investigation of the coronavirus threat would be increased from "excessive" to "far" meaning the highest level of alerting and risk checking.
Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, warned in a statement that it is time for every government on Earth to wake up.
This virus is coming, and you have to be prepared, he also urged that the right response measures will help the world to avoid the worst.
Ryan went on to say that the current information did not warn public health officials to declare it as a global disease, and that the announcement would mean that we were basically accepting that every human on this planet would be able to contain the virus.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Managing Director said that WHO is "extremely concerned about the increasing level and severity of the spread of the disease and the dangerous level of inaction". WHO is being heavily criticized for being shown to have handled the global pandemic inappropriately, including declaring a public health emergency late and classifying the virus as a global pandemic.
The adverse reactions included a petition from WHO Managing Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus demanding his resignation, which was signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of human rights experts called for an emphasis on respecting the rights of every person during the COVID-19 global pandemic.
These experts said that everyone has the right to life-saving intervention and it is the responsibility of the government.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or lack of health insurance should not be used to explain the discrimination of a particular group.
Experts point out that every person has the right to health, which includes persons with disabilities, minorities, elderly people, internally displaced people, homeless people, people living in extreme poverty, those detained as well as refugees and those in need of government assistance.
International government agencies are addressing the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform that provides timely and comprehensive information on response plans around the world, as well as opinions and advice.
From plans to empower the health system and the global economy to address the effects of lockdowns and restrictions on travel, the digital hub includes tracking the country's plans, and aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has also been criticised by the United States, UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Glove, and Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for his handling of the global situation in China's Hubei province.
Many of the administrators of the provincial-level Communist Party of China (CPC) were fired for their handling of quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the established political party's response to the outbreak in that part of the country.
Some critics believe that the move was aimed at shielding Xi Jinping, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, from people's anger over the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected the theory that COVID-19 originated from the US or Italy, arguing that the initial outbreak of the coronavirus originated from Wuhan.
US President Donald Trump's administration has called the coronavirus the "Chinese virus" or the "Wuhan virus" and said that China's "privacy has made a virus so dominant that it has become a global pandemic" that some critics have criticized as racist and "to ward off the failure of its own administration to control the disease."
The Daily Beast received a telegram from the U.S. government that contained a cryptic message of deception to the enemy that originated at the National Security Council, and which called the plan "everything about China."
We are being told to try and expose this message in any way, including through press conferences and television appearances. Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg have claimed that the effort to send aid to the virus-hit areas of China is a propaganda effort for a global dominance.
Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, warned that by a turnaround and "politics of generosity" is a geopolitical element involving a struggle for dominance.
Borrell also said that China is aggressively sending a message that it is a responsible and trustworthy partner than the US.
China has asked the US to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and has also reportedly sent aid to Venezuela and Iran.
On April 3, the U.S. government blocked the donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
U.S. officials have also been accused of diverting aid to other countries.
There have also been reported cases of mask-related disputes in other countries, for example Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
As a result of this, Turkey seized hundreds of ventilators for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government accused the European Union of lacking a sense of unity with Italy over the virus.
Italy's EU ambassador Maurizio Masari said that "only China responded bilaterally."
"That's not a good sign for Europe."
After a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on March 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin planned to send the Russian military to Italy with military pharmaceuticals, sterilization special vehicles and other medical supplies.
Italy's La Stampa newspaper, citing an unnamed "high-level political source," said 80% of the aid material sent by Russia was useless or of little use to Italy.
The source accused Russia of carrying out an offensive campaign of "geopolitical and diplomatic" persuasion.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Luigi de Maio, rebutted the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia has also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Piskov said that "while offering assistance to U.S. allies, [Putin] assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical materials and goods speed up, they will also repay as needed."
The planned "Defender 2020" of NATO's armed forces will be held in miniature in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO event since the end of the Cold War.
Kate Hudson, General Secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, criticized the program Defender 2020: “In the current public health crisis, this program not only threatens the armies of the US and many other European countries, but also the residents of the country in which they are working.” The Iranian government has been hit hard by the virus and currently has nearly two dozen members of parliament.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has written a public letter to world leaders for help on 14 March 2020, stating that his country is struggling to cope with the outbreak as international health markets do not have access to them due to the restrictions imposed on it by the United States. The outbreak has prompted the United States to adopt social schemes that are more common in other rich countries, including Universal Health Care, Universal Health Care, and Universal Health Care.
Political analysts predict that this will have a negative impact on Donald Trump's re-election in the 2020 presidential election.The global epidemic of the disease has damaged diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea criticized Japan’s “suspicious and passive attempts to isolate” after Japan announced that everyone coming from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at a government-designated location.
South Korean society was initially polarized or monopolized over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions either to impeach Moon for his handling of the outbreak, or to praise Moon for his handling of the government's handling of the outbreak. The pandemic has allowed the country to enact emergency laws in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this may give governments a chance to tighten their grip on power.
In Hungary, their parliament has voted to allow their Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule indefinitely, to dissolve parliament and elections, and to rule those who are believed to have spread false information about the virus, and to confront a government crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for a number of incidents, including shortages of supply items, which are generated globally by the increased use of outbreak-preventing equipment, panic buying, and disruptions in factory and transportation.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned of a shortage of medicines and medical supplies as consumer demand increased and suppliers were disrupted.
In many areas, panic buying was seen and as a result, grocery items like food, toilet paper and bottled water were lost on the store floors leading to shortage of supply items.
The technology industry has been warned about delays in shipments of electronic goods.
According to WHO Managing Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
As a result of this increased demand, prices have increased by twenty times the usual price and the supply of medical supplies has been delayed by four to six weeks.
This has also led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, and the WHO has warned that it would put health workers at risk.
The global pandemic has opened up new opportunities for Daegu shoppers to sell Australian goods to China.
This action led to a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite high cases of COVID-19 in northern Italy and in Wuhan, and the high demand for food items to come, both parts have survived a severe food shortage.
Measures against China and Italy's stockpiling and illicit trade of essential commodities have been successful, and so the acute shortage of food products that were expected in Europe and North America has been avoided.
Agricultural production in northern Italy has not experienced much decline, but prices may rise according to industry representatives.
The shortage of food in the store was only temporary in Wuhan, while Chinese authorities opened the stockpile of pork to feed the population.
In Italy, there are similar laws that require food manufacturers to reserve food for such emergencies.
According to a March 16 media report, China's economy has been severely impacted by the Chinese government's measures to curb the spread of the virus in the first two months of 2020, and retail sales have fallen by 20.5%.
As China's mainland is the main economy and the center of production, the outbreak of the virus is seen as a major threat to the global economy.
The Economist Intelligence Unit's Agathe Demarais predicts that markets will remain volatile until the potential results are apparent.
In January 2020, some analysts predicted that the global economic slowdown caused by the disease will surpass the time of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An expert from the University of Washington in St. Louis estimated that $300<0x2B> billion would impact the world's supply chain and could last for two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has been hit hard by a sharp drop in oil prices due to low demand from China.
The global stock market collapsed on February 24 as the number of COVID-19 cases outside the mainland of China increased significantly.
On February 27, amid growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indices, including the Nasdaq-100, S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, showed the sharpest fall since 2008, with the Dow collapsing at 1,191 points, the biggest drop in a single day since the financial crisis of 2007-08.
All three indices were down more than 10 per cent this week.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH acknowledged China's sovereign rating but maintained a negative outlook.
In the wake of the coronavirus scare, stocks fell back, most of them on March 16.
Many people think that there is a possibility of economic recession.
Economist Mohammed Al Ariyan praised the timely emergency measures taken by the Central Bank and the states.
Central banks are responding more quickly than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst affected sectors due to the closure of public places, including travel attractions, and governments advising against travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flyby has been closed.
The impact on the maritime industry has reached unprecedented levels.
Several railway stations and railway stations have been closed.
It was during this pandemic that Chunyan, the main traveller of the Chinese New Year holiday, arrived.
Many crowded events were canceled by national and local governments, including annual New Year's Eve celebrations, as private companies also closed their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many solar New Year events and tourist attractions were closed to prevent large crowds from gathering, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional shrines.
Authorities in 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions have extended New Year's holidays until February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to open until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to their infectious disease to the highest and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March and canceled New Year's celebrations. Retail market sectors have been hit globally and shops have been reduced or shops have temporarily closed.
In Europe and Latin America, the number of customers coming to retailers has dropped by 40%.
North America and the Middle East have declined by 50 to 60 percent.
As a result, there was a 33-43% drop in shoppers in the shopping centre in February compared to March.
Shopping malls around the world have been forced to adopt more measures such as increased sanitation, thermal scanners to monitor consumer temperatures, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the global pandemic will push more than 14 to 22 million people in Latin America into extreme poverty than it would have been without the global pandemic.
When the epidemic was at its peak in Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China in January and February.
Nearly 300 million rural migrant workers in China are stuck at home or in Hubei province. More than 10 million Americans lost their jobs in March 2020 and applied for government assistance.
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates that the coronavirus outbreak in the United States could lead to 47 million jobs and the unemployment rate could go up to 32%. The lockdown in India has led to the loss of jobs for tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (those who get paid on a daily basis). A survey by Angus Reed Institute found that close to 900,000 Canadian households have experienced some form of unemployment since the mid-March.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for a temporary unemployment allowance and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. In Germany, nearly half a million companies have sent their workers to work on government-subsidized short-term work plans called Kurtsrbite.
Germany's short-term work compensation plan has been adopted by France and Britain.
The fine arts and cultural traditions of the presentation have been deeply affected by this global pandemic and have affected institutions and individuals - both jobless and non-existent - on a global scale.
Art and culture organizations tried to continue their campaigns (mostly publicly funded) which included allowing the community to experience cultural traditions, ensuring the safety of their employees in public places, and helping artists whenever possible.
As of March 2020, a wide variety of museums, libraries, publishing houses, and other cultural institutions around the world have been indefinitely closed, and their exhibitions, programs, and performances have been canceled or postponed.
In response to this, there was a strong effort to provide alternative services through digital platforms. One of the more rapidly declining forms of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other concerts and social events such as concerts, technical conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruptions. The Vatican announced that it had canceled the observance of a religious week in Rome which is the last week of Lent's Christian repentance season.
Many bishops-dominated regions have asked older Christians to stay home rather than come to Sunday prayers, with some churches making church services available via radio, online live broadcasts or television, while some churches offering the option of drive-in worship.
While the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome shut down their churches and chapels and was emptying without St. Peter's Square devotees, other religious institutions have also closed services and limited the gathering of people in churches, mosques, synagogues, dioceses, and gurdwaras.
Iran's health ministry canceled Friday prayers in the area affected by the outbreak and closed after the samadha, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and residents from visiting the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to a massive disruption in the sports schedule around the world since World War II.
Several important sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that "the schedule of events will be rescheduled after 2020, but it will be before the summer of 2021".
This has led to many gamblers playing online, leading to a significant increase in the number of new sign-ups on many online gambling sites. Many music groups have postponed or canceled concert tours, affecting the entertainment industry as well.
Many major cities, such as Brisbane, have already implemented the program.
Some artists have found ways to continue to produce and share art on the Internet as an alternative to traditional virtual presentations, such as a virtual presentation of concerts or a web-based "festival" creation for artists to present, distribute, and publish their work.
Many online internet memes on the subject of coronavirus have spread, many of which work to create and distract jokes in this environment of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a strong prejudice and racism against the Chinese people and people in the region of East Asia, as well as hotspots in Europe, the US and other countries.
Many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, have reported incidents of fear, suspicion and hatred.
In a report in February (when most cases were still limited to China), records have been made in various groups around the world showing that the Chinese people deserve to be infected with the virus or that they are receiving some sort of ethnic feeling that is justified.
There has also been an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have noted discrimination based on regional origin.
There is support for the Chinese people, both online and offline, and for those in areas affected by the virus.
People in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19 after the outbreak of the outbreak in new hotspot countries, may have also been subjected to suspicion and xenophobia. People from other countries, including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, initially joined petitions to ban Chinese people from entering their country as an effort to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan has also become a hot topic on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in England and the United States have reported increasing cases of racism as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump has called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus," which critics consider racist and anti-China.
Ukrainian protesters have attacked a bus carrying Ukrainian citizens and foreign refugees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzari.
Students from the Northeast, who come from China and study in major Indian cities, are reported to have experienced harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, the state-level president of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, made a statement that the Chinese people had destroyed nature and "that is why God took their revenge."
The Chinese embassy in Kolkata later condemned the remarks, calling them "flawed". Zenophobia and racism against people who are not resident in China have been fueled by the epidemic, where foreigners are described as "foreign waste" and targeted for "disposal".
Newspapers with paywalls have removed some or all of the paywalls for their coronavirus-related reporting.
A number of scientific publications have published scientific research on the disease.
Some scientists have chosen a way to quickly share their results on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods to detect the presence of the virus and the antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the test is ensured by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to treat acute or chronic infections.
Antibiotics can be used for both diagnostics and population surveillance.
Antibiotic tests show how many people had the disease, including people with very minor symptoms or people with no symptoms to mention.
The results of this test can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunity of the group in the population.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable information on the spread of the virus to its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a large discrepancy in the number of tests conducted between countries.
This variability is also likely to significantly affect reported case fatality rates, which are also likely to be largely unrealistic in some countries.
The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) can be tested on respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs or spitting samples.
Results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
An RT-PCR test for throat sputum is only confirmatory in the first week of the disease.
The virus can then disappear from the throat and its number in the lungs continues to grow rapidly.
In the second week of testing of infected persons, either through a suction catheter, a sample can be taken from the deep air passages or a cough drop can be used as an alternative.
In January 2020, one of the earliest PCR tests developed at the charity in Berlin used real-time reverse transcription polymer chain reaction (RRT-PCR) and was the infrastructure component of the 250,000 test sets made available for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Cogenebiotech developed a clinical grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
This test detects the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses and the RdRP gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection set in China is one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China's National Medical Products Administration for the emergency use of the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2. The BGI Group was one of the first to be granted emergency use approval by the CoronaVirus-Cents International Centre in the US.
One in three of the older versions of the test kits caused inconclusive results due to faulty test reagents and hampered testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples being successfully processed each day throughout February 2020.
As on 28th February 2020, the tests conducted using two components were not considered as conclusive, and till then state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
Testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization.Professional laboratories in the United States began testing as early as March 2020.
On 5th March 2020, Lab Corp. announced the availability of RT-PCR based COVID-19 tests across the country.
Similarly, on 9th March 2020, Quest Diagnostics made available COVID-19 testing across the country.
No limitations were declared on the quantity; sampling collection and processing should be done in accordance with the CDC requirements.
The COVID-19 test was developed and developed by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology in Russia, Vector.
The test was registered by the Federal Service to monitor health services on 11 February 2020. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic reported that it had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a large-scale test that can be performed in 3.5 hours, thus allowing one machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to test the M2000 system of Abbott; the FDA had previously granted such authorisation to Holographic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21st March 2020, Safed similarly received an EUA from the FDA for a trial that would take approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid application technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can give a fixed result in as little as five minutes and a negative result in as little as 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 such machines in the US and Abbott is expected to ramp up production to 50,000 tests a day. The monoclonal antibody-using test that specifically binds to the novel coronavirus' nucleocapsid protein (N protein) is being developed in Taiwan. It is expected that the test will give results in 15 to 20 minutes.
In an information review in March 2020, it was concluded that " Chest X-rays are less useful in diagnosing early stages, while findings from CT [computed tomography] may be present even before symptoms begin."
Typical features of CTE include secondary heterogeneous lateral distribution with bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domains, crazy paving and aggregation develop.
A comparative study of PCR and CT in Wuhan, the epicentre of the current pandemic, suggests that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less characteristic, as it incorporates other pneumonia and disease processes with its many imaging features.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "Cit should not be used as a first-of-its-kind test to detect or diagnose COVID-19". The CDC recommends a PCR for early detection by March 2020.
Antibiotics including IgM and IgG were produced as part of the immune response to the infection.
These tests can be used to detect the infection after approximately 7 days or sometime after the onset of symptoms, to determine the immune system and monitor the population. The tests can be done in a Central Laboratory (CLT) or by Point of Care Testing (POCT).
Many clinical laboratories will be able to test large-scale automated systems created by certain processes over a specified period of time, but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system.
Although several samples can be used to track an immune response, a single sample of peripheral blood is commonly used for CLT.
A single sample of blood is usually obtained by skin puncture for POCT.
Different from PCR methods is that there is no need for an extraction before an investigation. On 26 March 2020, the FDA revealed the names of 29 ingredients that gave instructions to the agency as needed and therefore they are able to deliver their antibody tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitome Diagnostics received approval from the European Community for their testing sets, allowing the detection of IgG and IgA antibiotics in the background of the virus in the blood sample.
The capacity of the test is such that hundreds of samples can be tested in a few hours, and therefore this test is several times faster than the traditional PCR test of the virus RNA.
Antibiotics can usually be found within 14 days of infection. In early April, England did not find any set of antibiotics they had purchased to be suitable for use.
Hong Kong has devised a plan, in which suspected patients can stay at home, "emergency departments will give the patient a sample tube of the vaccine", they spit in it, send it back to the person who is infected, and in some cases they get a test result. The British NHS has announced that they are conducting an initial study of a plan to test the suspect at home or at risk of contracting the virus to others if they come to the hospital.
The drive-through centers have helped South Korea conduct the fastest, most-comprehensive tests of any country. On March 2 in Germany, the National Association of Statuary Health Insurance Physicians asserted that they had the capacity to conduct approximately 12,000 tests a day in a rotating system and that 10,700 people had been tested in the previous week.
When a doctor asks for a test, the cost is covered by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct a total of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19th, the drive-in tests were offered in several major cities.
The total number of tests carried out in Germany as of 26 March 2020 was not known, as only positive results were reported.
The first survey in the lab found that up to the 12/2020 week of the calendar and 12/2020, a total of at least 4,83,295 samples were tested for corona virus infection, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were tested together for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technione and Rambam Hospital developed a method to test all 64 patients at once.
Construction was carried out in 5 days under the supervision of BGI founder Wang Jian, and this modeling shows that if this testing capacity had not started on time, 47% more cases would have been seen in Hubei and the corresponding cost of handling quarantine would have doubled.
Wuhan laboratory has been promptly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in a total of 12 cities in China, such as Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
As on 4th March 2020, the total throughput was 50,000 tests per day. The open source multiplex design, published by Origami Essay, can be used to test 1122 patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be used in small labs without robotic liquid handlers.
As of March, the lack and insufficient quantity of reagents for large-scale trials in the EU, UK and US has been a stumbling block.
This led some authors to start using the sample preparation protocol, which included heating the RNA genome to 98 degrees Celsius (208 degrees Fahrenheit) for 5 minutes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the UAE was now testing more people for coronavirus in its population than any other country, and that testing levels were high on the way to reaching a larger population.
This was due to a combination of drive-through capacity and the purchase of wholesale throughput laboratories by Group 42 and BGI in proportion to the population (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of conducting thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first in the world to have such a large-scale conduction outside China.
Various test actions were developed targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) adopted Germany's action to send manufacturing kits to low-income countries without the resources to build their own kits.
Germany's action was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, which led to pending tests in the U.S. China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of the test sets in the early stages of the outbreak, and this country and Australia could not provide enough sets to meet the test recommendations from demand and health experts.
In contrast, the availability of large-scale tests in South Korea has helped slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean administration had built up over the years a large-scale testing capacity in private sector laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization (WHO) ordered the ramping up of testing programs as the best way to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.The widespread spread of the virus led to a huge demand for testing, leading to a backlog of hundreds of tests in private laboratories in the United States and a shortage of supplies of swabs and chemical reagents.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test sets.
The test kits developed by the CDC in the U.S. were "flawed"; the government later removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain bought the test kits from a Chinese company, Shenzhen BioEase Biotechnology Co. Ltd., but found that its results were incorrect.
The company explained that the failure to collect samples or use the sets properly may have resulted in incorrect results.
The Spanish ministry said it would return the wrong set of results and replace it with a different test set supplied by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test sets purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave the wrong result. Slovakia bought 1.2 lakh test sets from China which were found to be defective.
The kits suggested by Prime Minister Matovic should be dumped in Danube. Ates Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry said that the kits purchased by Turkey from China were "large in number" and that they "did not use". The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were not usable.
The test, followed by isolation of positive cases and tracking of contacts of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, have yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city where the first COVID-19 death occurred in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing at an estimated 10 days difference over the entire population of approximately 3,400.
About half of those who tested positive had no symptoms and were isolated.
By limiting the journey of social life, new infections were completely averted.
With aggressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on internal travel, testing and quarantine, the spread of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has been much slower than in other developed countries, and there have been no extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events have been cancelled and Singapore began advising citizens to stay at home from March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 at a time set after the holiday period.
The pandemic has been managed by many other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, through aggressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on domestic travel, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns.
Statistical studies have found that countries that conducted more tests than the death toll have a much lower mortality rate, perhaps because these countries have been able to detect only mild or asymptomatic individuals.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that countries that do not have testing capacity and have limited experience with COVID-19 in their national laboratories should send the first five positive COVID-19 samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 laboratories referred to by the World Health Organization for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 labs referred to, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The test strategy of the country is influenced by the "Positive Percentage of Tests" table in the table below.
While other factors are similar, even if symptoms do not appear, the country that tests all citizens will have a higher positivity rate than the country that tests only those hospitalized.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand washing, is an act of hand washing done by someone with the intention of removing soil, lubrication, microorganisms, or other unwanted elements.
Constant hand washing at certain "critical moments" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and rashes, the spread of which is spread by the hands to the mouth.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or a cold, for example, if they have not washed their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous skin).
The five most important times of the day when it is important to wash hands with soap are: before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning the baby's dung or changing diapers, before and after feeding the baby, before and after cooking food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry birds.
If water and soap are not available, hands may be washed with ash, the World Health Organization recommends hand washing at the following times:
Before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing the nape or after washing the dorsum of the child who has gone to the sanctum.
After sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
touching an animal or animal's food.
Medical hand hygiene is the practice of hygiene related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medication or seeking medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean hands from pathogenic factors (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but is also an important habit for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
This includes reducing the infant mortality rate in the home.
A 2013 study found that improved hand washing practices can lead to minor improvements in height in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, childhood mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes such as hand washing with soap.
These simple actions can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that stimulate hand washing can reduce the incidence of diarrhea by approximately one-third and can be compared with providing pure water to a low income segment.
A 48% reduction in the incidence of diarrhoea may be related to hand washing with soap. The act of hand washing with soap that is done in homes, schools and communities around the world is the only very effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ARI).
Pneumonia, which is the leading ARI, is a leading cause of death in children under the age of five, causing an estimated 18 lakh child deaths each year.
An estimated 3.5 million children die each year from diarrhoea and pneumonia.
According to UNICEF, instead of any vaccine or medical intervention, handwashing with soap before eating and after defecation can save more lives, reducing diarrhea deaths by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by one-fourth.
Hand washing is usually combined with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (wash) programs.
Hand washing also protects against anaphylactic shock caused by direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage by drying the skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that too much hand washing can lead to skin conditions such as itching of the hands, peeling of her papules, which is called a hand rub, or dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Washing hands frequently is also considered to be a symptom of OCD.
There are five important times during the day when washing your hands with soap is important to reduce the spread of disease by touching your mouth: when you go to the bathroom (milk, defecation), when you clean your baby’s diapers (after changing diapers), before feeding, before and after feeding the baby, before/after handling raw meat, fish, or poultry-class birds.
Other occasions when appropriate hand washing techniques should be adopted to curb the spread of the disease include, before and after treating cuts or other wounds; after sneezing, coughing or nosebleeds; after touching the feces of an animal or after handling an animal and after touching the waste.
In many countries, hand washing is illegal.
A study in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that hand washing rates were the highest in Saudi Arabia at 95 percent for school-age children, around 77 percent for children in the United States, and 23 percent for children in China. The practice of hand washing is among the lowest in the world. Some practice-changing practices are now being observed in developing countries.
The "Compulsory Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the scale of action to improve children's health and education.
The National Programme for Worm Destruction, along with daily washing of hands with soap, brushing of teeth with fluoride, is an integral part of the National Programme.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from the skin is enhanced by the use of soap or detergent with water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the inhibition of the solution and increase solubility.
Merely water is insufficient to cleanse the skin because fat and protein that contain organic soil elements do not immediately dissolve in water.
However, purification is done through proper flow of water..
Due to its recycling nature, solid soap is likely to have bacteria from previous uses.
Some studies on the migration of microbes through infected solid soap concluded that it was not possible for them to migrate due to the destruction of bacteria from the foam.
The CDC still says “hands-on non-touchable liquid soap is preferable for use.”
Antibiotic soaps have been strongly promoted among health-conscious people.
To date, there is no evidence of the use of antiseptics or disinfectants recommended for antibiotic-resistant in nature.
Antibiotic soaps, however, contain common antimicrobial elements such as triclosan, which contains a broad list of resistant strains of organisms.
Therefore, although antibiotics for disinfectant soaps have not been selected as stress-resistant, they may not be as effective as stated.
In addition to surfactant and skin-protecting agents, refined formulations, like pH regulators, contain acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid, lactic acid, and a wide range of anti-inflammatory active benzoic acid, and other skin conditioners (corfed, vitamin, menthol, plant extract).
Hot water that is comfortable to wash hands is not enough to kill germs.
The temperature of the body increases rapidly (37 degrees C).
However, soft water is more effective than soapy cold water in removing natural oils from the hands that contain soil and germs.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that warm water is not effective in reducing the microbial load on the hands.
Hand sanitiser or hand antiseptic is a non-water based hand cleaning agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to become popular.
Most of them contain isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulations with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) in gel form or moistener like glycerin in liquid form, or easy to use and foam form to reduce the effect of alcohol dryness.
Mild hydrogen-peroxide enhances antibiotic activity. At least 60 to 90 percent of the alcohol contained in the hand sanitizer is effective disinfectant.
Alcohol rub sanitiser kills germs, multi-drug resistant germs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some germs (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi
Alcohol rub sanitiser contains 70% alcohol and kills 99.97% on the hands in 30 seconds after applying it (3.5 log reduction which is equivalent to 35 decibels reduction) and 99.99% to 99.99% (4 to 5 log reduction) effective 1 minute after applying the germs. Hand sanitizer is very effective and kills some germs.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is completely ineffective against germs such as norovirus (or Norwalk), which is the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. A lot of hand antiseptic or alcohol rub should be used to thoroughly clean both hands.
Rub the front and back of both hands and the space between all fingers for about 30 seconds until the liquid, face or gel is dry.
Wash your fingernails, rub them on both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that hand sanitizers be used on hands after washing them when they appear to be dirty.
The use of these agents is increasing on the basis of easy use and rapid killing of micro-organisms; however, if soap and water are not available, they should not act as substitutes for washing hands properly.
The frequent use of alcohol-based sanitizers can dry the skin, so it should include skin softeners and/or moisturizers.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by using glycerin and/or other skin softeners in this formula.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emulsifiers in clinical trials reduce skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antibiotic detergents.
Allergies are rarely found in contact dermatitis, contact gallbladder syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol, or substances present in hand rubs.
As compared to hand washing with soap and water, a low tendency to induce harmful contact dermatitis became attractive.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not clean the hands of organic materials, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of pathogens because pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends on a very large number of factors and formulations, and has historically surpassed alcohol and alcohol rubies significantly.
Recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and stored antibiotic activity, unlike alcohol, where after repeated use the efficacy was seen to be reduced, possibly due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in the low-income group cannot afford soap and they use ash and soil.
The ash and soil may be more effective than just water but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it will increase the spread of the disease rather than diminish it.
Soil, like soap, is also a disinfectant because when the soil comes into contact with water, an alkaline solution is formed.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended using ash or sand as an alternative when soap is not available.
The exact techniques recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of the disease include the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold water.
Running water is recommended as the standing basins may be contaminated, and the water temperature did not appear to make much of a difference.
Apply a lot of soap, rub on your hands, in the back of your hands, in your fingers, under your nails and make a face of it.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies have shown that people wash their hands more regularly when soap is used than just water to wash their hands.
Hold hands for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing causes friction, which leads to the removal of germs on the skin and more germs due to rubbing over time.
Wash your hands with clean water.
Washing hands in the basin can be harmful.
Wash your hands with a clean towel or allow the air to dry.
Wet and damp hands are quickly contaminated back. Thumbs, wrists, fingers, and the lower part of the nails are the parts that are normally removed from hand washing.
Artificial nails and semi-finished nail polish can provide shelter to microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent the hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
Various low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing in places where tap water and/or soap are not available, e.g., pouring water and/or using ash with appropriate holes from a hanging jar or pumpkin, if necessary in a developing country. Limited water supply conditions (such as schools or rural areas in a developing country) - have other options such as tap water taps and low water taps.
Tipi tap is a simple technique in which a can is hung with the help of a rope to pour a little water on the hands and on the soap and has a leg-moulding lever.
Effective drying of the hands is an essential part of the cleaning process, but there is little debate about the most effective type of drying in public washrooms.
A growing number of research suggests that paper towels are much healthier than electric hand dryers in many washrooms.
A study by the University of Westminster London in 2008 to compare the level of cleanliness offered by paper towels, hot air-using hand dryers and modern jet-air hand dryers, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium, a paper industry.
After hand washing with a hot air dryer, the number of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 194% and the number of bacteria on the palms increased by 254%.
After the jet air dryer dried, the total number of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 42% and the number on the palm increased by 15%.
After hand-washing with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the fingers decreased by an average of 76% and the number of bacteria on the palms by 77%. As a result of each type of drying method, scientists conducted tests to check whether other washroom users and the washroom environment were likely to be polluted.
The jet air dryer, which blows air out of the unit at a speed of 180 meters per second (650 km/h; 400 MPH), is capable of blowing microorganisms out of the hands and units and polluting the washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 meters long.
Microorganisms spread up to 0.25 meters from the dryer using a hot air dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread. In a 2005 study conducted by TUV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand twisting methods were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the number of bacteria after hand drying:
Many hand dryer manufacturers exist, and hand dryers have been compared to drying paper towels.
In travel, washing hands with wipes is an option when soap and water are not available.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
After the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment, it became mandatory to wash medical hands.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
A study has shown that their use has reduced the incidence of infection.
Medical hand washing lasts at least 15 seconds, with the use of a large amount of soap and water or gel to make the face and wash each part of the hand.
The hands should be rubbed together.
If there is dirt in the nails, a bristle brush can be used to remove it.
It is important to wash your hands with soap and clean water.
After drying, use a paper handkerchief to turn off the water (and, if necessary, to open the exit door)
This way, they can get their hands dirty again.
In health care, the purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("insects") and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains at an unacceptable level in many medical environments, where a large number of doctors and nurses tend to forget to wash their hands before touching patients, leading to infection of microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple methods could reduce catheter-related blood transfusions by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet containing the ideal methods of hand-washing and hand-washing in the healthcare sector.
Guidelines on hand hygiene by the organization can also be found on their website for public comments.
Whitby and others had collated the relevant review.
If routine compliance demonstration is required, professional tools can measure and validate hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends washing your hands for five minutes.
When it comes to blood and body
Prior to the demolition,
After the patient has been cared for. If the soap contains an addition of antiseptic chemicals ("medicinal" or "microbial" soaps) the act of killing occurs in the hand washing liquid.
Before surgery or an antibiotic-resistant organism may require such an act of killing in places where there are large numbers, the hands can be 'grabbed' for surgical operation without touching the hands, chlorhexidine or iodine washes, sterilized towels for drying after hand washing, and disinfected towels for mowing. There is a second cleaning required for the tools under the nails.
All the ornaments should be removed.
For this procedure it is necessary to wash the part from the arm and wrist to the elbow normally for 2-6 minutes.
It doesn't take long (10 minutes).
When washing loosely, water from the wrist to the elbows should be avoided to go back on the hands.
After the hand-washing is complete, the hands are dried with sterile cloth and the surgical gown is draped over the body.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands before and after caring for a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcus infection in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand washing comes from the first 20% washing, and when the frequency of hand washing was increased by more than 35%, there was very little benefit.
Hand washing with simple soap, compared to antibacterial soap, has more than triple the rate of bacterial infection and spread of the disease in food. Every 30 seconds, compared to hand washing with an alcohol solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap, it was found that 26% less alcohol than antibacterial soap
But soap and water are more effective than hand-washed alcohol-based fluids to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and clostridium from hard seed cells than hand-washed alcohol-based fluids. Training employees to wash their hands, making hand-wash-based fluids more available to hand-washing interventions to improve hand health in a healthcare setting, and giving employees written and oral reminders may include this.
More research is needed to determine which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is being considered as a cheap and necessary means to achieve good health and good nutrition as well.
But the lack of reliable water supply, the lack of soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces has made it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behaviour.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there is a shortage of hand-washing taps near every private or public toilet, even though there are cheaper options for setting up hand-washing spaces.
However, low hand washing can also be a result of dead habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promotion of hand washing with soap and its rewards can influence policy decisions, create awareness about the benefits of hand washing and change the long-term behaviour of the population.
For this to be effectively implemented, monitoring and evaluation is necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that while a society-based approach to increasing handwashing levels in LMICs is effective, social marketing initiatives are less effective. An example that promotes hand washing in schools is the “three star approach” by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive measures to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene needs.
When the minimum standards are achieved, schools can move from one to three stars at the end.
Hand washing can be part of an initiative to encourage hand washing to reduce illness and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising initiative that seeks to change behaviour. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic in 2019-20, UNICEF promoted the adoption of hand washing emojis.
Some studies have taken into account the effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries in relation to the avoidance of overall costs.
However, one review suggests that it is significantly cheaper to encourage hand washing with soap than with other water and sanitation interventions.
For people in particularly vulnerable situations such as recently delivered mothers or injured soldiers in hospitals - two pioneers who worked on hand hygiene in the mid-19th century first recognized the importance of hand washing for human health: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "English founder of modern nursing."
At that time, most people believed that the smell of mimas was caused by infection.
In 1980, as a result of foodborne outbreaks and health care-related infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States encouraged hand washing more actively as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect ourselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, murals depicting "appropriate hand washing techniques" in public toilets and in toilets on office buildings and aircraft bases were placed next to hand washing sinks.
To wash one's hands is to express one's unwillingness to take responsibility for something or to share its complexities.
This originates from the Bible passage in Matthew where the Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but in some English societies this rhetoric came with more widespread use.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth is forced to wash in an attempt to wash off the fictitious stains while demonstrating her guilty conscience regarding the crimes committed and committed by her husband.
It has also been observed that people tend to wash their hands more often than others after remembering or contemplating immoral acts and tend to give more importance to the means of hand washing.
Also, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such contemplation are less likely to engage in other "cleanliness" compensatory actions, such as volunteering.
In religions it is said to wash hands for both hygiene and symbolic reasons. Using water to wash hands, but not using soap is a part of the practice of symbolic hand washing, which includes Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'u'll<0xC3><0xA1>h, Hinduism, Judaism's Tevilah and Netil<0xC3><0xA1>t, Christianity's Lavabo and Islam's Wudhu.
It is mandatory to wash hands after going to the toilet in Hindu, Jewish and Islam.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands before and after every meal.
Control of workplace hazards due to COVID-19
Workplace hazard control due to COVID-19 is the application of occupational safety and health practices to control risk for the prevention of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)
Proper workplace risk control depends on the nature of the workplace and the nature of the work, which depends on the source of infection, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors for every worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low infection risks include minimal professional contact with people and other colleagues, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home when they are sick, respiratory etiquette, and regular workplace hygiene and disinfection.
Work at moderate infection risk includes work that requires upward or close contact with those who are not known or are not suspected to be infected with COVID-19, but who may have been infected by ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, densely populated workspaces, and some large retail outlets.
In addition to the basic infection prevention measures, the risk management for the group includes maintaining air quality using high-capacity air-filters, use of sneeze guards and personal protective equipment in case a person is exposed to COVID-19.
Health workers and mortuary staff who have come in contact with a known or suspected person infected with COVID-19 are considered by the OSHA to be high infection risk, whether the worker is performing aerosol-forming procedures or collecting or handling samples of a known or suspected person with COVID-19, thus increasing the risk of exposure to too much exposure.
Risk controls suitable for these workers include negative pressure ventilation rooms and engineering controls such as personal protective equipment suitable for that particular task.
COVID-19 can have a huge impact on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to falling ill, needing to supervise others, or due to fear of a possible infection.
Commercial patterns can change both in the sense of what goods are in demand and the way of getting those goods (such as buying or distribution when less crowded or buying through drive-through services.)
Finally, there may be disruption in movement of goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19.Preparation and response plans for infectious disease may be used to take protective action.
They address various workplace and work-related risks, including sources of infection, risk factors arising from domestic and social sectors, and risk factors for each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also outlines the necessary controls to address those risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise due to outbreaks.
Preparation and response planning for infectious disease may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
Targets for responding to an outbreak include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at risk of health complications, maintaining business continuity and minimizing adverse effects on their supply chains, among other things.
Where there is a business, the severity of the disease affects the response received in the communities of that place.
There is a hierarchy of risk controls widely used in occupational safety and health to determine groups according to the effectiveness of risk controls.
While the risks of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, ultimately, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve separating employees from work-related risks, rather than depending on the worker's behavior, and may be the cheapest way to implement them.
Administrative controls are meant to alter the work policies or procedures which require the workman or employer to take action.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some infections.
All types of PPE should be chosen based on the risk to the worker, fit for use (e.g. respirators) and properly worn, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and assembled or disposed of properly to prevent infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHO), low infection risks involve minimal professional contact with the public and other colleagues.
It is recommended to adopt basic infection prevention measures for all types of workplaces, including upper and entire hand washing, inducing workers to stay at home if they are sick, adhering to respiratory etiquettes including covering their mouth while coughing and sneezing, including provision of tissue paper and dustbins for cleaning, regular use of telecommunication or preparation of separate shifts, and other equipment if necessary.
Immediate identification and isolation of potentially infected persons is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others at the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of severe respiratory illness, unless they have had a fever for at least 24 hours without taking other medications that reduce or alter the symptoms, should stay at home unless they have symptoms of fever and other symptoms.
According to OSHA, moderate infection risk work includes jobs for which such people are not known or suspected to have been infected with COVID-19, but who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 six feet (1.8 m) in close contact with people who may have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the commercial area, or because the person has recently traveled to an international travel site where COVID-19 has spread widely.
This includes workers who have come into contact with the general public, who have access to equipment that has been compromised, who have access to equipment that has been compromised, who has access to critical equipment, who has access to critical equipment, who has access to critical equipment, who has access to critical equipment, who has access to critical equipment, who has access to critical equipment and who has access to critical equipment, who has access to critical equipment, who has access to critical equipment, who has access to critical equipment, and who has access to critical equipment, and where there are places where there are vulnerable places.
The workers in this risk group rarely need to use respirators.
Proper controls to protect workers and other passengers in case a person falls sick on an aircraft include isolating the person at a distance of 6 feet from other people, appointing a crew member to serve the sick person and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissue paper while coughing or sneezing.
When serving a sick passenger or touching his bodily fluids or potentially infected surfaces, it is necessary to wear disposable medical gloves and if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing, the cabin crew must wear additional personal protective equipment.
Dispose of gloves and other disposable items in a biohazardous bag and then clean and disinfect the infected areas. For commercial vessels, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include delaying travel when sick and self-isolation when there is a fever or other symptoms while onboard the ship. Inclusion of this is indicated immediately to the medical center on the ship.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be done in the room of the quarantined person. The CDC recommends temporary closure for hygiene and disinfection, whether or not there is community transmission if an infected person is found in schools and child care centres.
Where there is a minimum to moderate community spread, social distancing policies may be adopted, such as postponing field trips, gatherings and other large events, including physical education or prayer classes or food in restaurants, increasing the distance between desks, changing arrival and departure times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and setting up separate health centres for children with flu-like symptoms.
While there has been a significant infection in the local community, with social distancing strategies in place, school closures may be considered for longer durations. The CDC considers the immediate health risk to law enforcement personnel performing routine day-to-day activities to be low.
Law enforcement officers who are required to be in contact with other persons who are infected with COVID-19 or are at risk of infection are recommended to follow the guidelines with appropriate personal protective equipment like emergency medical technicians.
If there is close contact during the period of care, the employees should clean and disinfect using household cleaning spray or wipe before reusing their duty belts and gears, and for a controlled period, as well as follow the standard operating procedure for disposal of used PPE, clothing segregation and washing.
OSHA considers certain staff in healthcare and morgues to be at high or very high risk of infection.
High infection risk activities include healthcare delivery, support, laboratories and medical transport staff who come in contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
If staff are performing aerosol-manufacturing procedures on known or suspected COVID-19 patients, or collecting or handling samples from such patients, they are at high risk of infection.
Aerosol-forming procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopes, certain dental systems, and examination or invasive sample collection.
The risk of high infection includes personnel engaged in preparing the dead bodies of persons known or suspected to have contracted COVID-19 at the time of death; if they do post-mortem, they are at high risk of infection. Additional engineering controls include isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including performing aerosol manufacturing procedures.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare and restroom structures.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 procedures.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated in separate waiting rooms if they are suspected of COVID-19. Along with other PPEs, OSHA recommends that staff working within 6 feet of known or suspected patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and aerosol-producing procedures should be allowed to use respirators.
In the United States, NIOSH accredited N95 respirators or better should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protective system, including fitness-testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory protectors can provide better protection and be more comfortable for employees. WHO does not recommend protecting the whole body, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, it does not spread through other body secretions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends wearing a surgical mask only at entry points.
WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, goggles or face coverings, gowns and gloves for personnel collecting, caring or transporting respiratory samples of patients undergoing treatment for COVID-19 without any aerosol-forming procedures.
If the aerosol-forming process is carried out, the N95 or FFP2 respirator should be used instead of surgical masks.
Since the global supply of PPE is inadequate, use of physical barriers such as telemedicine, clean windows, through which healthcare providers can directly access the COVID-19 patient cell using only the PPE required for specific tasks, recommends reducing the need for use of PPE masks for them, providing a single respiratory mask without side-effects while serving many of the diagnosed patients.

Sending Date/Time : 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
License: CC0 : No rights reserved
We are in a very difficult situation this month.
COVID-19 is a global phenomenon that highlights the interconnectedness of global humanity and our shared responsibilities towards each other.
We do not have precedents for this challenge, but we know that our best response depends on global empathy, cooperation and the building of a community at the heart of our organization.
A remarkable validation of how lucky we are to have the opportunity to work with so many amazing people is the goodwill and care that all of our colleagues show through email, phone, and chat.
I couldn't be more grateful and proud to call you my friend.
Last week, someone complimented me on my work.
He reminded me of how meaningful it is for the world to read Wikipedia right now, and how powerful it is to have this important tool online and available to everyone.
This is possible because of your work, whether you are updating this site or paying our colleagues or keeping your group safe.
The world needs more information than Wikipedia does.
This is the moment in which not only what we do, but how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Over the next few weeks, we will begin to make some significant changes in how we work together as a result of the importance of this campaign and your role in it.
Changes in our work and schedules.
As Robin noted earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss its approach and schedule in the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we thought about what response would be appropriate to the one we are facing and the best way to sustain the organization during this time.
We have a strong desire to relieve stress and help our mission in the long run.
If you want to go back, you don't want to go back.
For all employees, contractors and contractual employees:
Our daily working expectation would be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We're not declaring a holiday - if you're able to work more normal hours, you can use this campaign.
However, the world cannot be predicted right now and if you want to take care of your loved ones, bring groceries or go to the doctor, your health is our priority.
We're not taking your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
We don’t have to say it, but we’re saying it.
There's no need for sick leave or PTO - just tell your managers and help your team make corrections to the calendar and schedule, so that you can take care of important parts of the work being completed.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please tell Brian at T&C Ops, so that T&C can support you and ensure that your situation is properly addressed by the management).
Full-time employees will be paid.
We have already said and reaffirmed our commitment to our contractors and hourly employees to respect our commitment to colleagues.
Everyone will be paid according to their normal working hours.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people use work as a way to share the stress of the world around them.
Especially in a period like this, you can get amazing benefits from what you do.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We ask that you communicate with your manager, so that we know what to expect and we can make changes accordingly.
Some things are considered essential.
There are some things we need to keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety and Fundraising Team (some of the others) do important work, which may require additional help.
We will initiate the process with all departments to evaluate the current targets and focus on supporting the essentials for our mission.
There is a lot of work to do for all of you, we will only focus on the most important projects.
If you do it slowly, it will not break.
Once it went global, we didn't plan on "working twice as long to get the job done."
You don't have to work extra hours to get the job done.
We accept that the situation has changed and we will work to set new goals and schedules when appropriate.
What is the Annual Plan (AP)?
While adjusting to our new realistic and daily work expectations, we aim to adjust the timeline for the delivery of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will give employees more time to prepare budgets to prioritize important tasks, self-care, and caring for their loved ones while engaging those people who need to work in the next few weeks or who want to work for a shorter period of time.
This extension of the deadline will greatly reduce the current planning workload and stress throughout the organization.
"We will submit our proposal to the board next week, and we will update our representatives and teams on further action as we confirm this."
Thank you for your leadership in this app.
Office status, infection and cleanliness
Last week, we learned that one of our employees in the SF area was likely to be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
Nevertheless, with extreme caution, we have appointed an anti-viral cleaning team to disinfect all areas in San Francisco's offices.
They use high-quality antiviral solution used in the clinic to disinfect every surface, as well as the lobby and the escalators on our floors.
This building adopts its own precautionary measures by using such products which help in the safety of its tenants.
We are pleased to announce that we are ready to return to work.
Our DC office is located in the WeWork area, where measures regarding COVID-19 have been shared with us and with all other DC-area staff.
Last week, our DC office was transformed into a fully remote set-up in line with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-area colleagues know, we're discussing renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are going on, but we can be quick in this.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Friends who have been working remotely for a long time know that this will only be an adjustment, and they want to give you some advice:
Limit the duration of your meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If you need long sessions, consider how they can be divided into several days.
Explain the agenda of the meeting clearly and send the materials to them in advance.
Make this video by default with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate direct collaboration and connection.
To make each meeting easier, ask someone to lead it, who will monitor the chat for questions asked, check the list of speakers, and ask someone else to help take notes (or take notes in collaboration with each other).
Send an e-mail to the technical support if you need a headset.
Use your money to pay for the destruction.
Join Slack’s <0x23>remotez channel to talk to your colleagues about assigned work.
The Human Resource Management team is looking at 'Webinar based ergonomics' to help with the growth of the work delivered throughout the organization.
Last week we asked all community grant recipients to postpone Wikimedia-funded public events like "Aditathones," until the WHO announces an end to the pandemic.
We told them that we had come to know that our request for moratorium and other restrictions would make it impossible to meet their agreed grant-in-aid, and also stated that no one would be punished for this delay and for changing that target.
Next week we'll be tracking additional guidance for Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences.
A common sense of the global community as a whole seems to be both sad about this disruption, but also at the same time, the clarity and the ability to focus on our own communities, Wikimedia, and others.
Going forward, CRT is working to establish a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space for communities to monitor this impact and track our communication with them.
Staying in touch with COVID-19-related issues.
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, at 14: 00 UTC / 07: 00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time understanding each other.
We are all in this together and we will help as much as we can.
In the meantime, we continue to receive information via this email and other important information on COVID-19 at Office-Wiki.
The CRT will keep the pages up-to-date and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees, who live in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have any questions about travel, ceremonies, a major workflow, or any other challenges that you may have in mind, or need help with anything else, don't hesitate to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help and support, if needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive content, please send an email to Brian Judd, Director of Human Resources Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as an abandonment and restriction of our work.
Instead, they have to give official approval that our work and liability at the moment will need to be adopted in a way that we have never done before.
These are the steps that we think are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue to work, provide them with the needs, and provide the services they rely on.
We will do our best to help you when the time comes.
Now is the time to work together and create space for the important work that will be done in the coming weeks and possible months.
We need all of you to make this happen, so you need to take care of yourself and your family, so that you can give your best when you need it.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face.
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V., Brian J., Dorian D., Gregory V., Joel L., Linette L. Ryan M., and Tony S). And the rest of the leadership team (Grant I., Heather W., Jamie V., Jenine U., Liza S., Robin A. Ryan S.).
B'angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell cover) of cells in the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 opposes the action of angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE2) related to angiotensin-converting enzymes by reducing angiotensin-II levels and increasing anng(1-7) and hence it is a promising drug for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. For some coronaviruses, ACE2 acts as an entry point into cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often called HACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-converting metalloenzyme that is present on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptide M2 domain and a C-terminal colloidal renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single pass type of mucous skin protein that is activated by the action of your enzymes on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is broken down by another transmembrane called sheds, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood and eventually dissolved in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most of the organs: the membranes of type II alveolar cells in the lungs, enterocytes in the small intestine, endothelial cells in the arteries and veins, and the smooth muscles of the arteries in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a resistance to ACE.
The ACE Angiotensin I hormone is absorbed into the vasoconstriction angiotensin II.
In turn, ACE2 angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) breaks down carboxyl-terminal amino acids and hydrolyzes them into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-I-Hr-Val-T)
[des-Arg9]-A number of other peptides, including bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphine A, and ghrelin, can burst ACE2.
The neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 also regulates the membrane transport of ACE2 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Interestingly, the binding of the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells to the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 results in endocytosis and the transfer of both viruses and enzymes to the endosms located in the cells.
The admission process also requires priming of S protein by host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is ongoing as a potential treatment in the current investigation. This has led some to conclude that lowering ACE2 levels in cells will help fight infection.
However, many commercial organizations and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control".
In addition, those who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure, their risk was reduced after treatment with ACE inhibitors.
Although the effects of ACE inhibitors are less potent than the overall risk of pneumonia, the use of ACE was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality.
Recombinant human ACE 2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and has shown to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and it takes 30 minutes for the effect to start and the effect (period) is 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or intolerance to high-ranking diseases of imbalanced angiotensin. In clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome, rhACE2 has been evaluated.
b-COVID-19 apps are software applications in mobile, designed to help people get in touch in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying individuals ("contact") who have been in contact with an infected person.
Numerous applications were developed and proposed with official government support in some provinces and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks were developed for the creation of contact tracing apps.
Concerns have been raised about privacy, especially in systems that track the geographical location of app users.
The use of Bluetooth signals to log in with a user's other cell phone is included in the less intrusive options.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
The Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay in China, has made an app available so that citizens can check whether they have come in contact with people infected with COVID-19.
The app is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, it is called Trace Together.
The app was developed by a local IT community and made available as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched a Bluetooth-based app "Stop Corona" to contact potentially infected individuals and respond quickly to healthcare authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
The app was waiting for approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store until April 14, 2020.
The app is in an advanced stage of development and will be available in a few weeks, the government said on 12 April 2020. A similar app is planned in Ireland and in France (“Stop COVID”).
Australia and New Zealand are both considering apps based on Singapore's Trace Together and Blue Tooth protocols. Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app designed to ensure that they do not leave home for COVID-19 infected patients living in Moscow.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including misalignment of positives and a low probability of effectiveness if app use is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
While expressing concern about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple set limits on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to their app stores, limiting it to "official" or otherwise reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed serious concern about the impact of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially regarding whether the surveillance infrastructure designed to combat the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed.
Amnesty International and 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limits on such surveillance.
There are eight levels of government:
It must be "legitimate, necessary, and authentic."
There has to be a sunset clause for the extension of surveillance and surveillance;
The use of the data is limited to the reasons for COVID-19;
Information security and anonymity will have to be secured and shown to be protected on the basis of supply;
There is a need to avoid extreme discrimination and neglect due to digital surveillance;
The sharing of information with third parties should be defined in the law;
The right of citizens to protect against abuse and to respond to abuse;
Meaningful participation of all “related stakeholders” is required, including public health experts and neglected groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporters Ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also issued checklists.
Once the need for a tracking system is over, the proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the problem of permanently removing it from their device operating system.
Some countries use network-based location tracking instead of apps, which eliminates the need to download apps.
Network-based tracking has been approved in Israel.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems that have a central server have to access personal location data; many privacy-protected systems have been created that use a central server only for intercommunication.
South Korea used a system that was not based on the app to present contact tracing.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system combined a variety of tracking information, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and potentially -infected individuals to create a notice via text message.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made the location information publicly available, something that was allowed, due to far-reaching changes to the Information Privacy Act following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through numerous apps and websites. Other countries, including Germany, have considered both central and privacy-protected systems.
Details have not been released as of April 6, 2020.
Privacy – Protected Contact Tracing is a well-established concept, with research material from at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly measures, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log in with other cell phones to ensure the user’s proximity.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that has both centralized and decentralized mechanisms and not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy – proximity detection (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka contact event numbers, CEN), privacy protocols and mechanisms for contact tracking to mobiles (including other (PACT) mechanisms.
Personal data that is identifiable in these protocols never leaves the device and all matches are on the device.
The privacy group at the MIT Media Lab is developing SafePath, a platform to use privacy-protected techniques when collecting or using location or path intersections to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on a research paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace, a privacy technology developed by Enigma MPC, which was originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace allows users, without compromising the privacy of that data, to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was founded by groups that had originally come together around a similar approach and largely overlapping protocols, and their goal is to reduce fragmentation, capture and enable the functionality of alerting apps, which is a key aspect of wider adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol open source used by its official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy cryptography, in which they claim privacy will be maintained.
He also highlighted the features of the basic technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system can be brought in three phases:
Roll out tools to enable Governments to create Government secrecy - protecting coronavirus tracing apps.
The integration of this functionality directly into iOS, Android Google and Apple first plans to address the problems of continuous monitoring by distributing the system through operating system updates and removing the same way again after the risk has been eliminated.
B-drug repositioning (also known as drug repurposing, re-profiling, retasking, or therapeutic switching) is the use of a drug approved for the treatment of one disease or another.
This is the same type of scientific research that is currently being done to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Plasma infections for vaccination and reinfection. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 draggable proteins, each of which has several associated binding sites.
The analysis of such binding location provides a suitable scope for the preparation of a potent antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like proteins, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP riboflavin.
Husain AA and others studied the various candidate compounds and then identified and analyzed the similarity of their nature with the approved drug so that in their preclinical studies, anti-SARS-CoV-2 multiplicative drug can be developed and recommended in the clinical study plan.
Chloroquine is an anti-climatic drug used to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that the four drugs to be studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial would include chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that tests on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would be conducted in the state of New York from March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
These treatments have not been approved by the FDA through a clinical trial process and are authorized under the EUA only for experimental treatment for patients who have been hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under a clinical trial.
According to the CDC, "the use, quantity, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been certified.
The drug is used when there is "no other option left."
A small study was conducted by the Turkish research team in Istanbul, in which chloroquine is used along with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
A large number of studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine is being tested by the NYU Langone Medical School as a preventive measure.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed Favipiravir to be "fully effective".
If 35 patients tested negative in Shenzhen in 4 days, then the duration of illness of the 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half were given favipiravir and half received umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical company reminded the public that the current level of support for the drug is inadequate and elementary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for storage, and distribute it to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe held formal talks with the Trump administration about the purchase of the drug, which may be less effective in patients with severe illness because the virus has already multiplied there.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who are trying to get pregnant.
A study on Lopinavir/Retonavir (Caletra), in which antivirals Lopinavir and Retonavir were combined, concluded that "no benefit was shown"
The drugs were developed to prevent the reproduction of HIV by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to improve these drugs to find compounds that bind to the protein of SARS-CoV-2. There has been criticism in the scientific field for using the drug developed for new purposes for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has included Lopinavir/ritonavir in the Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that Remdesivir showed intracellular antiviral activity against phylo-, nympho-, paramyxo-, and corona-viruses.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance to mutations that result in more serious diseases and infections.
Some earlier pre-test studies have suggested that Remdesivir may have high gene resistance. Some clinical trials are ongoing, with two ongoing trials at Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with mild illness and the other for people with severe disease.
Three clinical trials are underway to provide head-to-head survival for patients with severe COVID-19 disease and hospitalizations; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one unregulated (Italy).
The state of New York began testing azithromycin on March 24.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct clinical trials to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with the novel coronavirus of a corticosteroid inhaled by Tijin's alvesco (cyclosanide).
Angiotensin-converting Vicker 2, on which Phase II trial is underway, will include 200 patients from among the critical patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany, and Austria.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
More than 6,000 adults aged 40 years and above, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization are being recruited for the study, called colcoronavirus.
Pregnant or lactating mothers as well as women who do not follow the effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Various anti-cluthenics are being tested in Italy.
Heparin, which has a low molecular weight, is being used to treat patients, which encourages medical institutions in Italy to publish guidelines.
A multicenter study of 300 patients was announced by Italy on April 14 to investigate the prevention and therapeutic amounts of anoxaparine sodium.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientific attention is being paid to the use of antiviral drugs that were previously approved in the outbreaks of MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus for new purposes.
Ribavirin: As per the 7th edition of China Guidelines, Ribavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment.
Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of China's guidelines.
Some of the antibiotics that have been found to be suitable for the new purpose of treatment for COVID-19 are:
Tocilizumab (IL-6-anti-receptor): approved from China
See also Tocilizumab <0x23>COVID19 tests in China and Italy.
The B'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although clinical trials of any vaccine have not been completed, several efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that the SARS-CoV-2 anti-viral vaccine is not expected to be available before 18 months.
In April, a Phase I safety study was conducted on five vaccine candidates.
COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019.
The outbreak of 2020 has led to a huge investment in research and development of vaccines.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2
As announced in April, the CEPI initiative's essentials for developing a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale planning and global reach.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that research and development was underway on 10 different technology platforms in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The major platforms in Phase I safety studies are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral Vector (Phase I Developer & Vaccine Candidate:Cansino Biologics, Adenovirus Type 5 Vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the pre-development stage, out of which 78 projects have been confirmed (79 as per the Milken Institute), and another 37 have been announced and very little information has been made public (assuming there is planning or planning).
Phase I-II trials have primary safety and immunogenicity checks, which are usually randomized, placebo controlled and performed at multiple locations to determine the exact, qualitative quantity.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a controlled group, to test the vaccine's efficacy to prevent disease, and to monitor for side effects after adequate doses are given.
Of the 79 vaccines in active development (as confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated in humans (yet "preclinical" research is underway).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that potential molecular clamps were exploring a vaccine that would induce a genetic improvement in virus proteins and immune responses.

On 12 March 2020, India's Ministry of Health announced that it was working on 11 isolates and it would take about one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine despite working at a fast pace.
Medicago, a biotechnology company based in Quebec City, Quebec, reported on 12 March 2020 that it had developed a coronavirus-like particle by receiving partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Laboratory research on the vaccine candidate is underway and is planned to be tested on humans in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.N. President Donald Trump offered Curvec a "huge sum of money to get the only access to a COVID-19 vaccine," for which the German government protested.
On 17 March 2020, US-based pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
Pre-clinical trials for mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162 are currently underway and clinical trials are expected in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takiz Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that it would receive the results of pre-hospitalization testing in April 2020 and human trials of the final vaccine candidate would be conducted thereafter.

In March 2020, Hewlett Packard Enterprise's cloud computing resources, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, along with the United Nations government, industry, and three universities, all used the resources together to access IBM's supercomputers.
Some vaccines have odd effects, which can also be called unintended consequences.
This means that it can have other benefits in addition to prevention of the disease.
Further, 4,170 healthcare workers will be recruited for a randomised trial in Australia.
The vaccines being developed are unlikely to be safe or effective.
Previous research conducted to evaluate vaccine efficacy on COVID-19 specific animals such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other lab animals and other primates other than humans suggests the need for biosafety-level 3 regulatory measures to handle the live virus and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Anti-SARS and anti-MERS vaccines have been tested on animals other than humans.
As of 2020, there is no cure for SARS or a vaccine that is both safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, finding and developing novel vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health organizations around the world. No standardized vaccine for MERS has been developed.
When MERS became more dominant, ongoing research on SARS was believed to provide a useful model for finding vaccines and drugs for MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, Phase I clinical trial of one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine in humans had been completed, and work was underway on the other three vaccines, all of which were viral-vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BFRS-gamevac), and one MVA-vectored (MVSVA).
The post on social media has sparked a debate about the conspiracy, according to which the virus responsible for COVID-19 was known and the vaccine is already available.
The patents that have come forward as evidence from various posts on social media refer to the genetic sequence of other coronavirus-like coronaviruses and existing patents for vaccines.
B'Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Fever, cough and difficulty in breathing are common symptoms.
Fatigue, muscle soreness, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of smell and stomach ache can be other symptoms.
The duration of onset of symptoms from obstruction is usually five days, but it can be from two to 14 days.
Most patients have mild symptoms, while in some patients the disease progresses, resulting in viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As on 17th April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported from 210 countries and territories, of which 153,000 have died.
More than 5,68,000 patients have recovered from the disease. The spread of the virus is mainly through direct contact with people, often through coughing, sneezing or wheezing.
While breathing out, these tusks are thrown out and fall to the ground or surface, they do not carry infection at very long distances.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and touching the eyes, nose and mouth.
The virus can survive for 72 hours on any surface.
The first three days after the onset of symptoms are highly contagious, but the spread can occur even in the pre- and post-symptomatic stages. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of the nasal secretion is the standard method of diagnosing.
Those suspected of being infected with the virus and serving them are advised to wear masks.
The general public is advised to wear a mask, some officials are against wearing a mask, some people are advised to use it and some people are advised to use it.
There is currently no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for COVID-19.
Most countries in all six WHO regions have reported local transmission of the disease.
Patients who are affected by the virus sometimes do not show symptoms or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
Sudden symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent pain or tension in the chest, feeling confused, difficulty walking, and blurred appearance of the face and lips; it is advisable to go to the hospital immediately if these symptoms occur.
Mild symptoms can include respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nosebleeds, or sore throat.
In some patients, symptoms of diarrhoea were more frequent, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Some patients in China initially showed signs of chest tightness and heart palpitations.
In some patients, pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death were reported.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but in some people it can be two to 14 days.
97.5% of the patients who developed symptoms showed up within 11.5 days after infection. Reports show that not all patients who were infected develop symptoms.
The role of non-symptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet clear, but they are said to be involved in the spread of the disease at an early stage.
The proportion of infected patients who have not shown symptoms is not yet known and is under study, while 20% of the confirmed cases from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) are reported to be asymptomatic in the hospital.
China's National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic patients in daily cases from April 1; of the 166 infected patients who emerged that day, 130 (78%) had no symptoms at the time of examination.
Both red and green have a high risk of infection.
It's easier to talk than normal speech.
According to a study done in Singapore, coughing without a mouth cover can lead to tushars going up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) away.
Although the virus is not from the air, the National Academy of Sciences has predicted bioaerosol transmission and positive virus RNA has been detected in samples taken from gas collectors in people's outdoor areas.
Some medical procedures, such as the insertion of a tube into the body and the resumption of the heart and blood vessels, can cause respiratory discharges and thus spread through the air.
When there is concern about the spread of the virus by the feces, the risk is considered to be low, with people with the symptoms most likely to be infected with the virus; and
According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), although it is not yet clear how easily the disease spreads, it can infect two to three people in one person. The virus lives on surfaces for hours to days.
In fact, the virus has been found to be present on paper cartons for up to a day, on plastic and steel surfaces (AISI 304) for up to three days, and on surfaces containing 99 per cent copper for up to four hours.
However, it depends on the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere and changes accordingly.
Soaps and detergents can be effective if used properly; soap products degrade the thick protective layer of the virus, inactivate it, and separate it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other measures, such as benzaconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a kind of surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken two days after hospitalization.
Of the six patients, five had the highest number of pathogens in the first sample and the sixth had the highest number of pathogens in the second day trial.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel highly contagious coronavirus that was first isolated from three patients with pneumonia associated with the Center for Chronic Respiratory Diseases in Wuhan.
All the features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are visible in the corona virus associated with it in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that forms its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The main effect of COVID-19 is on the lungs, as the virus is transmitted through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to the original cells, which is abundant in the second type of cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein, called spike, to bind to ACE2 and enter the original cells.
In China, 12 percent of hospitalized patients in Wuhan have severe heart disease, and it is often found in serious illnesses.
While the symptoms of acute heart injury are largely due to the inflammatory response of the body system during the disease outbreak and the loss of immunity, the acute heart muscle injury may also be related to the accompaniment factor of ACE2 in the heart.
The ACE2 receptor is abundant in the heart and is involved in the function of the heart.
Examples of blood clotting (31%) and blood clotting in the veins (25%) have been found in a large number of severe COVID-19 patients. They are probably related to unsystematic diagnosis. Post-mortems of patients who died due to COVID-19 have found that their lungs are dehydrated (diffuse alveolar damase) and lungs have also become inflamed.
Although SARS-CoVID-2 has a tendency to infect cells with respiratory tract cells for ACE2, symptoms of hyperinflammation appear in severe patients with COVID-19.
Particularly pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells were found to be associated with the appointment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes in COVID-19 patients and acute pulmonary embolism.
The post-mortem also showed infiltration of white cells.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a number of guidelines for testing the disease.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is the accepted method of testing.
Respiratory samples obtained by throat secretions are usually tested; but respiratory secretions or spitting samples can also be used for this.
Test results are usually available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests can be done, but this requires two samples of blood done at a two-week interval, and the immediate value of its results is low.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the virus and publish its genetic sequence, allowing laboratories around the world to independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests that detect the virus.
As of 4th April 2020, antibody tests (which can diagnose the current infection and can also tell if a person has been infected before) were being developed, but were not widely used.
China's experience of testing shows that its accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first Point of Care test to be used later that month on March 21, 2020. The diagnostic guidelines released by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggest methods to identify infections based on chemical characteristics and risk of pathology.
Bilateral multilober ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric and background distribution was common in the initial infection.
As the disease progresses, it may lead to subpleural dominance, bizarre paving (lobulal septal thickening with variable alveolar fillings) and concentricity.
There is little information available about the physiology and micro-injury of COVID-19.
Some of the important facts about post-mortem diagnosis are:
Things that can be seen with the eyes: inflammation of the lung cover, pain in the heart cover, puffiness of the lungs and swelling of the lungs
There are four main types of pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: Inflammation of the lungs, overgrowth of lung cells, unassociated large cells in the lungs, interstitial inflammation of white cells, and the formation of versatile large cells
Acute Pneumonia: loss of lung function and uncontrolled secretions in the lungs
Diffuse alveolar damage is caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome and a severe lack of oxygen.
Pneumonia: uncontrolled discharge in the lungs and interstitial fibrosis in the lungs.
Blood: internal secretion in the arteries (decomposed intravascular coagulation); leukorrheumatic reaction
Measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently and for at least 20 seconds, maintaining respiratory hygiene, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends holding a handkerchief in the nose and mouth while coughing or sneezing. If you do not have a handkerchief, cover your nose with a hand corner.
People are advised to wash their hands after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends wearing face coverings in public spaces to limit exposure to asymptomatic people. Social distancing is aimed at reducing contact with large crowds of infected people. Schools, offices have been closed, travel restrictions have been imposed and mass gatherings have been banned.
People have been asked to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from each other.
A vaccine for COVID-19 is not expected to be available until 2021, so a key part of the management of COVID-19 is to get the disease under control. It is also called 'Flattening the Curve'.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently for at least 20 seconds with soap and water, especially after defecation or when their hands appear to be damaged, before eating and after touching their nose, coughing or sneezing.
The CDC further recommends that hand sanitizers containing alcohol content of at least 60% alcohol should be used only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial products of hand sanitizers are not available, the World Health Organization has provided two formulations for local production.
Antibiotics in these formulations are derived from either ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to inhibit the growth of microorganisms in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand germination."
Glycerol has been included as a moisture-resisting component.
Patients are managed through supportive care, which includes oxygen delivery, fluid treatment and supporting vital organs that have been affected.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they are carriers of the virus should wear a simple face mask.
The treatment of oxygen from outside has been used for the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being noticed.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet have been suggested to boost immunity.
Supportive treatments may be used in those with mild symptoms at an early stage of infection. The World Health Organization and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations to care for patients with COVID-19 who are hospitalized.
Critical epidemiologists and pulmonologists in the US have collated treatment recommendations from various agencies under the same open source IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
Some medical professionals suggest the use of paracetamol initially instead of ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in the processing of airborne sprays, such as ducting or hand ventilation, while using medical facilities.
The CDC, in addition to providing general precautions, contact tracing and airborne transmission precautions for health workers who care for COVID-19 patients, recommends that such patients be kept in the Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR).
Precautions recommended: PPE gowns, respirators or facemasks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirators should be preferred over facemasks.
N95 respirators have been approved for industrial use, but the FDA has also approved the use of masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles such as dust in the air but, among other uses, its effect cannot be guaranteed for a particular biological medium.
When masks are not available, face coverings or homemade masks can also be used as a last resort as per CDC recommendations.
The majority of COVID-19 patients are not as serious as medical ventilation or some other option is required, but only a small percentage of them are.
The type of medical respirator that patients are getting due to respiratory obstructions caused by COVID-19 is being continuously studied for people in the hospital. The process of inserting a hose through the nasal passages or through the bilevel positive airway pressure can be avoided.
It is not yet known whether either of these two are equally beneficial for patients with severe illness.
Some doctors prefer invasive mechanical ventilation treatments if available, as the technique limits the spread of airborne pathogens as compared to inhaling inhaled air. The incidence of the disease is much higher in older people (in people over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries also do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, so a sudden increase in the number of severe COVID-19 cases could limit the capacity of the healthcare system to deal with the question of hospitalisation.
According to a study conducted in China, 5 per cent of the total patients were admitted to the ICU, 2.3 per cent needed outside ventilation and 1.4 per cent died.
About 30% of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals in China had to be finally admitted to the ICU.
As severe respiratory problems (ARDS) develop in COVID-19 patients, technical ventilation becomes more and more complicated and it becomes more and more difficult to deliver oxygen.
While over-supply of oxygen from ventilators and high PEEPs with pressure control capabilities is essential to reduce the risk of lung injury and pneumothorax caused by ventilators.
High-capacity PEEP may not be available on old ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and many antiviral drugs are going through trials thereafter.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although it will take until 2021 to develop new drugs, many of the tested drugs have been approved for other uses or are going through further trials.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on critically ill patients.
Volunteers recommended by the World Health Organization participate in trials to study the impact and safety of these potential treatments. The FDA has provisionally approved the treatment of convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment for patients whose lives are at risk.
They have not gone through chemical studies to determine whether they are an effective and safe treatment for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can show 'close contact' with the observed information and understand the possibility of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
The app suggests self-isolation if a potential risk is indicated. Not only that, it also provides information to local health authorities. Big data analytics on cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are all used in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore to monitor infected patients and their contacts.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security departments to check the data of mobile phones of people suspected of being infected with the coronavirus.
Measures were taken to impose quarantine and protect those who may come in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom handed over data collected from phone locations to the German Federal Government Agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to be used to prevent the spread of the virus and for research.
Russia has installed face recognition technology to detect people who break the quarantine.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Julio Galleria, said he was receiving information from mobile phones.
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 partners.
Estonia's President Kersti Carluliad has made a global challenge to find some concrete measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
Isolation, travel restrictions, the adverse effects of treatment, or the fear of being infected can all be distressing.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor's statement that "increasing social isolation, loneliness, health care, stress, and economic decline are the root causes that threaten people's mental health and well-being."
These diseases may have little or no symptoms at all, with other respiratory illnesses such as common cold and cough.
While mild cases usually heal within two weeks, it can take three to six weeks to recover from a serious illness.
Based on information from other similar viruses such as SARS, MERS, it may be said that pregnant women who are severely infected with COVID-19 may be at greater risk, but there is no information about COVID-19. COVID-19 can affect the lungs in some people, causing pneumonia.
COVID-19 can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in people who are severely affected, resulting in respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure, etc.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver, etc.
Among those admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19, 6% were found to have abnormalities in blood clotting, increased prothrombin time, and 4% were found to have impaired kidney function in these groups.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have been found to have high liver enzymes.
In the same report, it has been stated that the period between symptom onset and death was 10 days, out of which 5 days were to be admitted to the hospital.
However, the patients admitted to the intensive care unit had to be admitted to the hospital and the time between their death was seven days.
Early case studies found that the median period of death from the onset of symptoms of the disease was 14 days.
A study by China's National Health Commission (NHC) said the mortality rate for men was 2.8%, while for women it was 1.7%.
The histopathological test of the post-mortem lung specimen shows diffuse alveolar lesions along with cellular fibromyalgia in both lungs.
Pneumococcal changes have been observed.
Pulmonary artery was associated with Acute Respiratory Disturbance Syndrome (ARDS).
High levels of troponin or cardiac arrest were found in 11.8% of reported deaths by China's National Health Commission.
According to a U.S. March report, 89% of those admitted to the hospital had some prior complaints. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic status of the area also affect the death toll.
Due to regional differences, the mortality rate changes in this situation, while also due to systemic difficulties.
Lower count of mild cases may lead to higher mortality rates.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of cases that have come into contact in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers, and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive surveillance or die. Concerns have been expressed about the long-term prevalence of the disease.
Hospital officials in Hong Kong found a 20% - 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people who had recovered from the disease, and organs damaged in a lung scan.
This can lead to post-intensive care syndrome.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether past infections provided effective and long-term immunity in people who had recovered from the disease.
Depending on the behavior of other coronaviruses, it can be said that immunity is likely to appear, but cases in which the coronavirus test positive in the next few days after recovering from COVID-19 have been reported.
It is believed that in such cases, there may be prolonged infection rather than re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural and has its origin in an animal and is spread by infection.
Its actual origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the infection was entirely caused by human-to-human transmission.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January showed that December 1, 2019 was the earliest date for symptoms to appear.
The official publication by the WHO has listed 8 December 2019 as the earliest date of onset of symptoms.
A variety of measures are generally used to calculate the mortality.
These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the period since the outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
In the last quarter of 2019, WHO has provided the emergency ICD-10 code U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.1 for deaths that have not been confirmed by laboratory-confirmed clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19. The death-to-case ratio divided by the number of cases over a specified period of time.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.9%.
This number varies by region. Other measures include the Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which displays the percentage of diagnosed individuals who have died from a disease, and the ‘Infectious Death Rate (IFR), which displays the percentage of infected persons (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died from a disease.
These figures do not have a time constraint and they follow a specific population infected through the case version.
While not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may inform how many people are infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, 4600,80 (1.7%) people have died so far in a small village called Castiglio de'Adda.
In Gengult, the disease spread through the Carnival Festival and spread to young people, resulting in a relatively low mortality rate and perhaps not all COVID-19 infected deaths can be formally classified in this way.
Moreover, the German health system is not burdened as much.
About 3% of people in the Netherlands may have antibodies, according to information from a blood donor.
69 people (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed dead from COVID-19.
The impact and mortality rates of this pandemic are different for women and men.
Studies conducted in China and Italy have found that the mortality rate of men is higher.
Men in their fifties are most at risk, with the lowest mortality rate among women and men in their 90s.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact cause of these gender differences is not known, but the cause may be genetic and behavioral.
Gender-based immunity gaps, low prevalence of smoking in women, and the development of co-morbid conditions such as high blood pressure in men at a younger age than women could all be the cause of higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government had not been tracking gender-distance information in people infected with COVID-19.
The research found that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A large number of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and are at higher risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19."
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that CO means corona, VI means virus, D means disease and 19 is the year when the first outbreak of the disease was detected: 31 December 2019.
The name was given to avoid referring to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species, or group of people, which followed the international recommendation for the nomenclature, and was intended to avoid stigmatizing anyone. The virus, which causes COVID-19, has been named Civilian Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public communication, the WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19".
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the time of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were both commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and " Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV Acute Respiratory Diseases as interim names for the virus and disease, following the 2015 guidance against using the site in the name of the disease and the virus.
The official names for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to the limited capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers are printing health care materials as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
For example, when a ventilator valve was urgently needed in a hospital in Italy and the supplier was unable to fill it on time, a local startup company did reverse-engineering and printed 100 valves at night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, cut-offs, inaccurate and distorted information on the origin, magnitude, treatment and other aspects of the disease quickly spread online.
Humans have been known to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence that pigs, ducks and chickens could replicate the virus.
No drug or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccine and drug is underway by the government.
In March, the WHO launched a "solidity trial" to assess the treatment effects of the four most effective antiviral compounds.
Currently, there is no vaccine available, but various agencies are actively preparing vaccine candidates.
The earlier studies on SARS-CoV-2 are being used, as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 neurons to enter human cells.
So far, three vaccines have been developed.
The goal of the researchers is to develop a vaccine for the virus.
The purpose of the use of such a virus, whether it is inactivated or dead virus, is to generate a new infection with COVID-19 in the human body's immediate immune response.
Another strategy is sub-unit vaccines, which aim to produce vaccines that sensitize the immune system to a specific sub-unit of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research focuses on S-spike proteins that help the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme nerves.
A third strategy is about nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, an innovative technology to create vaccines).
Trials are required for the safety and efficacy of any of these three strategies. On March 16, 2020, clinical trials of one vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
This vaccine has a risk-free genetic code, a replica of which is made from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody dependent enrichment has been suggested as a potential challenge in developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
As per the report as on April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted.
Seven tests were evaluated from already approved treatments for malaria, including four on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The majority of Chinese searches include multi-purpose antiviral drugs, with nine trials on Phase III taking place on Remdesivir in several countries, according to a report submitted at the end of April.
As of April 2020, dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates is present. Several existing antiviral drugs have been evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Rytonavir and Interferon beta are included.
According to a March 2020 report, provisional evidence for the effect is present by Remedisvir.
Medical improvement was seen in the patients treated by Remedisvir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, which was previously used for malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, a collective review is required for this research.
Korean and Chinese health officials have recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending one gram of this daily, noted that its double dose is very dangerous and can even lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine based on the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. The Chinese Seventh Edition Guide also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggests that high doses of ribavirin are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in the trial.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further testing after exposure to low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have noted that early spike protein predominates through transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE-2 nerves.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major problems that prevented the medical community from resorting to these treatments without further study. Oseltamivir has not prevented SARS-CoV-2 in experiments and has not found any known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokinin storm can be complicated in the next stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokinin storm properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guide by the National Health Commission of China after a small study.
In Italy, non-randomized Phase 2 tests are being conducted at the national level after seeing positive results in people with severe illness.
When combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm, it means opposing a development that has been considered a cause of death in some infected people.
Interleukin-6 neurone antagonist was approved by the FDA in 2017 based on a retrospective study conducted for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome, a variant of CAR T cell treatment.
Tocilizumab is not a randomized, controlled evidence that it is an effective treatment for CRS.
The search is underway as a non-vaccinated method of transmission of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to those who need it.
This strategy was used for SARS, but it did not yield any special results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action, by which passive antibody treatment against SARS-CoV-2 can be carried out.
However, other techniques, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Development of other forms of passive antibody treatment is underway, for example, the use of manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convalescent serum, which includes the fluid protein in the blood of recovered patients, and which contains antibodies specific to this virus, can be extended for rapid development.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, became infected with COVID-19 and died after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
