During the hearing of the petition, 1,000 farmers submitted an affidavit stating that the state government did not have the right to acquire their land.

Advocate Anand Yagnik, appearing for the farmers, argued that the central government did not respond to the country's most expensive project worth Rs 1 lakh 10 thousand crore involving more than one state, despite more than three months, and did not follow the guidelines of the JICA company.
The central government is trying to ensure that the case does not go to the High Court by not filing a reply.

At the international level, China seeks to make the yuan an international currency at the same level of the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar.
In view of the possibility of economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are exploring the possibility of making this deal in rupees and rubles.
New Delhi: India and Russia today signed an agreement on the S-400 missile defence system.
Russian President Vladimir Putin will be seen signing the agreement with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his two-day visit to India.
The S-400 deal is expected to pave the way for the US dollar to be used to pay for the deal.
Sources claim that in view of the possibility of economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are exploring the possibility of making this deal in rupees and rubles.
U.S. suspends trade with China
In September, Russia signed an S-400 missile deal with China.
After this deal, US President Donald Trump decided to impose sanctions on China.
As a result of the sanctions, the purchase of missiles for China using US dollars was almost impossible.
However, in recent years, China has tried to raise its currency, the yuan, against the dollar, as an international currency.
Since the move, China has been trying to convert the yuan into an international currency, equivalent to the euro, yen and pound.
On the other hand, China has the largest reserves of the US dollar in international trade.
China wants to make the yuan an international currency.
The $5 billion mega defence deal could see the U.S. impose a countering U.S. Adversaries Through Sanctions (CAATSA).
Last month, the US imposed a ban on the purchase of S-400 missile systems from China.
India and Russia had already started to establish an alternative mechanism for this deal.
Earlier, the US sanctions on the repair deal of INS Chakra, which was taken on lease from Russia, led to an estimated $2 billion deal between India and Russia.
Economic analysts claim that to get out of such a situation, India should use the rupee-rupee exchange as an international currency.
It is worth mentioning that so far all defence deals with Russia have been done through the dollar.
Why was the U.S. Constitution created?
In August, President Donald Trump approved Russia's new missile defense system, known as the Katsa, to prevent Russia from acting against the interests of the United States internationally.
The U.S. law is based on Russia's actions.
These include Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine, its annexation of Crimea, its involvement in the Syrian civil war, and its meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
And then there was the thousand-year-old mystery.
This story is about a Turkish man who made a big discovery while repairing a house.
When he opened the door to his apartment, he was struck by a broken door.
From here he reached an underground tunnel, where he encountered a thousand-year-old city hidden under the ground.
The city's pictures show how about 20,000 people lived in this underground city with all their belongings and food.
There are 6 entrances to the city:
The incident took place in 1963 when a Turkish man living in Cappadocia discovered the underground city.
The wall of his basement collapsed while repairing the house.
From here, an underground city called Darinyuku, located at a depth of 280 feet under the ground, was found.
Its height was equal to 18 storeys.
This underground city was once home to 20,000 people, with everything from rooms, coaches, schools, churches, tombs, etc. to ventilation.
There are 600 gates to enter and exit this city.
There are a lot of doors that are closed to prevent people from entering the building.
Each floor can be closed separately.
The city is believed to have been built between 780 and 1180 A.D. during the Byzantine period to protect the people here from war and natural disasters between the Arabs and the Byzantines.
It has become a tourist attraction:
Darinkuu is not the only underground city in the world.
There are many other such cities, but this is the largest of them underground cities.
Only half of the city can be reached, but the place has become a popular tourist attraction in Cappadocia.
Due to its historical and cultural importance, people come here to see it.

The truth was revealed in the post-mortem report of the birds.
The incident of birds falling unconscious and colliding with a window in Minnesota, USA, has given rise to many rumors.
Some said that the bird had fallen prey to blade magic, while others began to associate it with this unusual phenomenon.
As the incidents began to escalate in many places in Minnesota, police launched an investigation and brought the mystery behind the incident to the public.
The birds have become a business.
The police had been receiving many complaints about strange behavior of birds and falling on the road.
After being harassed by repeated calls, the Gilbert Police of Minnesota launched an investigation into the matter.
Gilbert police collected the birds, which were hit by windows and vehicles, and conducted a post-mortem on them, which revealed shockers.
The bird was drunk when it collided with windows and vehicles.
The big question for the police was, how did these birds get into the body of the drug?
Is there a plan to kill the birds?
There was another story behind his death.
The birds were flying through the trees.
The police solved the crime with the help of a team of experts.
It is said that most of the birds were getting drunk by eating one type of berry (sugar-free fruit).
In England, this type of berry is called fermented berries.
In this type of cell, the sacrum is transformed into a sacrum.
When the birds ate the fruit, they began to get drunk.
This was the reason why the birds were flying very low.
The birds of prey were creating confusion in the birds, which caused them to stumble.
The police told us how to save it.
Gilbert police said it was not possible to stop the birds from eating the fruit.
People have figured out a way to save themselves.
The police said that the window with more reflection and windscreen can be prevented from hitting it.
Police told the public through Facebook that they should not pay attention to rumors in any way because there is no black magic.

At the time of his first visit to the city, the Prophet
Description: The world's oldest living person has made his or her own mark on the world of music in his or her own words.
He is being compared to Sachin Tendulkar.

Sachin Tendulkar was also happy with the start of the innings.
He also praised the country.
He remembered the day when he first saw the earth shake and what he had to say about it.
About 10 years ago, his friend Jagdish Chauhan once asked me to watch Prithvi Shaw's batting.
"This young player wants to meet you and it would be great if you can meet him," Chavan said.
He turned to his friend and looked at his watch.

How can the court language of Sultan Mahmud Ghazni of Ghazni, who is the eater of Somnath temple and a villain for the common Indian, be Sanskrit?
In fact, research by Professor Shanta Pandey, a historian of Delhi University, has made it clear that Ghazni's official language was Sanskrit.
Recently, when Shri Somnath Trust honoured Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for their service to Sanskrit, it was natural to have a question whether Sanskrit was the only language of the so-called upper class Brahmins.
Remembering Ghulam Dastgir Birajdar, the Pandit of Mumbai.
The 87-year-old Pandit Birajdar, who spoke in a simple Sanskrit that even rickshaw-pullers can understand, is still finalizing the Sanskrit translation of the Holy Quran before publication.
The Holy Qur'an is written in Sanskrit.
Ku <0x2B> Ra means the sound or message heard on the earth.
Not only did he study in the Pathshala of Solapur, but today he is considered as one of the greatest Sanskrit scholars of the country.
However, Panditji, who has lived a simple life, does not seek to give lectures on Sanskrit as a Pandit in America or other countries in order to market himself.
The princess of Thailand is a pandit of Sanskrit.
There's a lot of Sanskrit in there.
To learn Sanskrit from the US, one has to go to Bonn University in Germany.
In India, except for Banaras Hindu University, most of the universities also have a Ph.D. dissertation in Sanskrit which is written in the language of that state itself.
In Gujarat, Sanskrit is taught in Gujarati, but it should be remembered that in Takshashila and Nalanda universities, education was given in the Sanskrit medium.
In Afghanistan, Prof. Shanta Pandey has said that Ghazni's Darbar language of the Sultan was not only Sanskrit, but she has also noted that her money coins were inscribed in Sanskrit.
The coins are inscribed on the "Muhammad Suratran" inscriptions in Sanskrit, and Panini, the author of the grammar of Sanskrit, is a resident of Shalapur, Afghanistan.
Pandit Nehru, in his book "My Hindu Darshan," described the coming of the Pashtu language of Afghanistan and Pathans from Sanskrit in a huge chapter "The Power and Sustainable Power of Sanskrit."
Today, it is accepted that not only Indian languages, but also Indo-European languages are derived from Sanskrit.
It is surprising that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the main architect of the Constitution, and several other members of the Constituent Assembly, Muslims and South Indians, had proposed that Sanskrit be made the national language of the country.
On 13 September 1949, when the debate on the national language in the Constituent Assembly against Hindi, Dr. B.V. Keskar and Nazruddin Ahmed were among those who proposed the national language to Sanskrit.
The discussion of that day and the report published in the "National Herald" on September 11, 1949, give an estimate of the absurdity of the Sanskrit language.
Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to determine a national language.
22 Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu, have a place in our Constitution as the official language, but not as the national language.
According to the 2011 census, Sanskrit is now the mother tongue of only 24,821 people in the country.
Prime Minister Nehru also spoke about Sanskrit in the Constituent Assembly with great respect.
In the relevant chapter of his treatise, he delves into Sanskrit and explains the importance that scholars around the world have placed on it: "As early as 1874, Sir William Jones said, "God knows how old Sanskrit is, but its composition is wonderful."
It is fuller than the Greek language, more abundant than the Latin, and more dignified than both.
Nehru further notes: "I don't know how many times Sanskrit has become a dead language, that is, since it has become a dead language."
At present, Sanskrit is the only language to be administered by members like Union Minister Smriti Irani as an MP.
We need to celebrate the birth of Sanskrit and make it a living and folk language.
If the dead language of Israel can be revived in Hebrew, Sanskrit is still a living language.
It's important to make a conscious effort to do so, rather than trying to make it public.
After being greeted at the airport, Narendra Modi asked who would accompany him?

WhatsApp users can no longer do this work more than 5 times, the feature will come soon
WhatsApp is going to bring a big feature for its users.
