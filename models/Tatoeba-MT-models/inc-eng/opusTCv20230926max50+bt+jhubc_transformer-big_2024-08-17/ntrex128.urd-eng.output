Welsh AMs worried about ‘looking like fools’
A suggestion in some AMs that their address should be changed to MWPs (Welsh Parliamentarians) is found to be disturbing
This was due to the change of the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The whole political spectrum is worried that this might make them laugh.
A Labor AM said their group is concerned that its voice resonates with Twp and Pwp.
In Welsh, "twp" means crazy and "pwp" means dog.
A Plaid AM said their group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested an alternative.
A Welsh Conservative said his group has an "open mind" about the name change, however said there was a short verbal jump from MWP to the insane.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same as the English letter u of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a legal draft to introduce a name change, said: "Any address to which the members of the Assembly are addressed is of course to be decided by the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 empowers the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, showing broad support for what the Assembly calls the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the AMs' address, the Commission has endorsed the members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but the MWP has received the most support in public consultation.
AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but reaching a consensus could be a pain for presiding officer Alan Jones, who is expected to submit a legal draft on the changes within weeks.
Legislation on reforms also includes other changes about the way the assembly works, including rules about the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
During the debate on the legislation, the AMs will make the final vote on which address they should be addressed.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of Eastern Macedonia."
The referendum is aimed at resolving a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has named one of its provinces Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name expresses its claim to the region, and has repeatedly objected to its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's President George Ivanov, who opposes the name change, has said he would ignore it.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeif, have argued that the name change is simply the cost of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells were silenced while churches in Harlem faced difficulties.
"Historically, every time I spoke to old people, I would say there was a church in every corner.
Not both of them today.
He said it was impossible to leave the bar.
Today's people are different in many ways.
Bars no longer sit in neighborhoods where people used to go on a regular basis.
As far as churches are concerned, they are concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and they will stand where they left off.
He added that the churches could be replaced by condominium apartment buildings that would be filled with people of the type who would not help the rest of the area's places of worship.
He said that the overwhelming majority of those who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white and they will play a role in the early closure of these churches because it is very unlikely that those who move to these condominiums will become members of these churches.
The two churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community a decade after St. Martin's in 1870.
The original white-collar Methodist group moved in the 1930s;
A black group of people who worshipped nearby took the building as their name.
A black group, led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, took over St. Martin, and they had led a boycott against the Peregrine merchants on Harlem's main business street 125th Street, resisting the hiring and promotion of blacks.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but when Father Johnson's church circle planned to rebuild it, they hired Carolyn.
Father Johnson's son and his successor in St. Martin, Reverend David Johnson, described Carolyn as "the bells of the poor."
In July, an expert playing the Caroleon told him something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
Tiffany, an expert at the University of Michigan, mentioned that it was the first carolina to be played by a black musician, Denise A. Lund, who moved to the large carolina 18 years ago at the Riverside church.
Mr. Mary Weeder said that St. Martin did not change it.
What has been going on in St. Martin for the past few months is a complex narrative of architects and contractors, some brought in by church leaders and others by a pastor.
Vestry, the parish's administrative body consisting of general leaders, wrote to the priest in July expressing concerns that the architects and contractors in the parish would put the costs on the vestry to be sent to them, even though the vestry was not involved in recruiting them.
Some residents complained about the lack of transparency.
Shark injures a 13-year-old boy in California after diving for shrimp
On the first day of the lobster season on Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy as he was diving to catch shrimp in California, government officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 p.m., near Bacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard a boy running for help.
Hamel said that at first he thought that he was running happily on shrimp fishing, but then he realized that he was running because something had bitten me.
Something has cut me off.
Hamel reported that when he went to the boy, he saw that his entire Hansley's bone had been opened.
Hamel said he told everyone to get out of the water and that there was a shark in the water.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Roddy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is said to be critical.
The attacker's identity is not known.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said during a media briefing that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous type of shark.
Gilles added that the boy had sustained injuries in the upper limb.
Officials have closed access to Swami Beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca for investigation and security purposes.
Gayles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
The UK's entry into the housing market
Sensbury is offering products of bots, superdrags and debon hams with racks in the style of the department store with the staff of SplashShot assistants.
As part of a significant influx into Britain's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion construction jewelry market, which is still growing while sales of fashion and home decor continue to decline, 11 more stores across the country should be tested and more stores added next year if successful.
The investment is being made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use shelves that were once used for TVs, microwaves, and home decor items.
Sensbury has said it will double the size of its make-up offerings by adding brands such as Revolon, Aisa, Tweezersman and Dr Paa Paa for the first time.
Current offers from L'Or<0xC3><0xA9>al, Maye Blaine and Britsbees will also be expanded by providing specific locations for the brand, as is the case in bots stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique make-up series so that most products are vegetarian-friendly - something that younger buyers are asking for as much as possible.
Additionally, the fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop will also test the discounts at two Sensbury stores, the first of which opened last week in the Croydon area of south London, and the second in the Selly Oak area of Birmingham later this year.
The shift in trend towards online shopping and buying small amounts of daily food from local convenience stores means supermarkets will have to do more to attract people.
Sensbury's chief executive, Mike Cope, said their outlets would look more like department stores, while the supermarket chain was competing with discounted aldees and leads with more services and non-food items.
Sensbury also operates Argos outlets in hundreds of its stores and has introduced several hybrids since it bought the two chains two years ago.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its manufacturing and pharmacy sectors had failed.
Sainsbury's had tried a joint venture with Boots in the 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to share revenue from chemist stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes at a time when Sensbury sold its 281-store pharmacy business 30 years ago to Lloyds Pharmacy China owner Celesio for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
It said Lloyds would play a role in the project by offering skin care products to luxury brands in four stores, including La Roche Posey and Vichy.
Paul Mills Hicks, Commercial Director at Sensbury, said: "We've changed the shape and feel of our fabrication decorative racks to improve the environment for our customers.
We have invested exclusively in specially trained staff who will be able to offer immediate advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet every need and the impeccable looking environment and aesthetics spaces mean that we have now become an exciting place to offer a make-up ornamental product that challenges the old style of shopping.
Peter Jones 'infuriating' after Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
"Dragons Dunn star Peter Jones TV presenter Holly Willoughby is ""infuriating"" after she walked out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle brand business."
There's no time like the present for brand-trolley of costumes and accessories to be worn in their home with Willoughby.
The couple's business is compared to Gonith Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old Prez announced his exit from the deal on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby quit the lucrative lifestyle brand business of Dragon Dunn star Peter Jones at the last minute, leaving her furious. Willoughby wants to focus on her bumper contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones became "angry" when TV's Golden Girl admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlowe, Birminghamshire, on Tuesday that her new deals worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million meant she would not be able to afford to buy clothes and accessories at Jones' home.
His business was compared to Gonith Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double his wealth to about <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As soon as 37-year-old Willoughby announced his exit from the trolly on Instagram, Jones immediately left the UK for one of his vacation homes on a plane.
One source said: "Trolley has been Holly's top priority for quite some time.
This is considered their long-term future in the next two decades.
Everyone was surprised by his decision to leave.
No one could have predicted what was going to happen on Tuesday.
The Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of goods that is ready to sell.
Experts believe that the departure of Daz Morning's presenter, one of the UK's most profitable stars, could cause the firm to lose millions of pounds due to heavy investment on products ranging from jewelry and candles to clothing and home wear, and the possibility of further delays in its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three, Willoughby, and her husband, Don Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Kap for 10 years.
Willoughby set up the trolley in 2016 along with Kap and the 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple were vacationing together and owns a 40 percent stake in Jones Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and host the ITV show I'm A Celebrity in place of Ant McPartlin.
A source close to Jones said last night that he would not comment on his business dealings.
It was a tough conversation and then we fell in love.
He criticized the news media for making comments that some consider "non-presidential" and mocking the North Korean leader for being positive.
Why did President Trump make such a big deal about it?
Trump said in his “News Anchor” joke.
"I didn't get away with anything."
He recalled that Kim was interested in a second meeting with him, after Trump described the June meeting in Singapore as an important step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
Likud is in the process of negotiating the denuclearization of the Middle East.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly that North Korea had not seen a "responsive response" from the U.S. to its initial disarmament measures.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions to increase pressure.
Trump was more vocal in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people become millionaires.
Our relationship is now strong.
His efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages and bringing back the remains of U.S. troops, he said.
And he defended his unusual style in talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people into this crowded place, you're seeing about 200 people standing in front of you," Trump said.
A tsunami in Indonesia, the island was destroyed by an earthquake, killing hundreds
As a result of the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they were not needed.
Although 10 percent of Lombok's population had been displaced, a national disaster has not been declared, which is the main scar for international aid.
Ms Sombong said that in many cases, unfortunately, they were quite clear that they would not request international aid, which is a bit too polite.
While Save the Children is forming a team to head to Palo, it is not yet convinced that its staff will be allowed to work on the spot.
Sopoto, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palo whether international agencies should be allowed to participate in the rescue efforts.
In spite of constant earthquakes, the country is not prepared to deal with natural disasters at all.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are rarely seen on the beach.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palo is believed to be responsible for the loss of life.
Even in the best of times, it is a pleasure to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make the logistics more complicated.
The ship is heading to Palo Hospital in Lombok to treat the quake victims, but it will take at least three days to reach a new natural disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia's infrastructure the focus of his election campaign, spending money on roads and railways.
But Joko's administration is facing a shortage of funds, with next year's elections to be held.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from rising religious tensions in Indonesia, while some members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of religion.
In the clashes between the Christians and the Muslims, in which more than 1,000 people were killed and many were displaced, using daggers, bows, arrows and other hand-held weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Strauss scored equal to Chelsea's goal
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a score in the 89th.
Sturge received a pass from Harden Shaqiri from Chelsea's goal by about 30 yards when his team was trailing by zero against one.
He took the ball first to the left and then shot to the far post.
The ball reached the top right corner of the net floating above the box.
The ball eventually fell to the net at the capa arzbalaga.
"I was trying to get into this position, to get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I tried to make my way for myself.
When I saw the fork coming, I just touched the ball once and took a shot without much thought.
Chelsea got a 0-1 lead with a score in the 25th minute by Bulgarian star Eden Hazard in half time.
The Blues striker rotated the rhino near midfield and gave the pass back to Mateo Kouchak with an heel kick after running into Liverpool's half.
Kochak immediately captured the ball in midfield.
He then brought the ball back into the box with Hawthorne in a beautiful manner.
Hazard hit the defense, throwing the ball from the left-back's stumps to Liverpool's Alison Baker from the next post into the net.
In the group stage of the Champions League, Liverpool will face Liverpool at 3 pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paulo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will take on Vidotun in UEFA Europa at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
Indonesia's disaster management agency said Sunday that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami has reached 832.
The agency's spokesman, Sotopo Provo Nogroho, told a news conference that many people were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings due to a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which on Friday will cause waves up to 20 feet high in the sea.
The city of Palo, which has a population of more than 380,000, sees debris from collapsed buildings everywhere.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murdering a woman with a knife.
An investigation was launched this morning after the body of a woman was found in the Birkenhead area of Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman's body was found at 7.55 a.m. on John Street by Grayson Mews, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area to report to the police if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages but I appeal to those who were around John Street in Burkenhead to contact us if they have seen or heard anything suspicious."
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, if they have done some capture of Dashcam footage, contact us as it may contain the same information that is important to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a native of Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
Friends who think they know the woman came to the scene this afternoon to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, while police have said they are in the process of informing the woman's close relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his flat but has been told by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was stunned when he found out about the incident.
Residents are now being told that it may take several hours before they are allowed to return home.
A police officer said the entire area was being cordoned off.
A woman came to the scene of an accident.
He used to say, “It’s so sad.”
At 2 p.m., two police cars were inside the fence, while a car was parked outside.
A number of officers were inspecting the blocks of bare flats inside the flats.
Anyone with information is being asked to DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 without giving a name by referring to the 247 log of September 30.
Krumwell's statue outside Parliament has been embroiled in a controversy over 're-editing history'
His exile would be natural justice for the destruction of the Taliban style of England's so many cultural and religious arts that it was carried out by its fanatic and hardcore Christian followers.
However, the Cromwell Society called Mr. Kirks' proposal "ignorant" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: In the current debate about the removal of the statues, it was na<0xC3><0xAF>ve that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be targeted.
Cromwell did not command the destruction of England's civil wars, nor did he do so.
Perhaps in the previous century, the wrong Cromwell would be made a scapegoat for the actions of his ancestors Thomas.
Sir William Hamo Thorney Croat's excellent representation of the chrome wheel is a testimony to 19th-century opinion and part of the obituary of a character that many savants believe should be praised.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sandy Telegraph: "A lot of people, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, consider Cromwell to be the man defending parliament against the external pressure that was, of course, the kingdom to them.
Whether this is an accurate representation has been the subject of ongoing historical debate.
One thing that is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict laid the foundation for the development of our country and that Cromwell is the individual identifiable figure who represents a part of this division.
His works as Lord Protector are valuable and memorable.
A Chinese farmer was murdered by a Chinese farmer.
According to local media, a pig attacked a farmer and killed him in a market in southwestern China.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that the dead man, identified only by his family name "Yuan," was found in a pool of blood in a market in the Leipzig region of Guizhou province.
A farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in Zhengzhou, China's Qinghai province, on May 30, 2005.
According to reports, he had come with his cousin from neighbouring Yunnan province to sell 15 rounds in the market on Wednesday.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that the door of the pigs' enclosure was open nearby.
He saw that there was a large male pig in the fence with blood on its mouth.
According to the report, the forensic examination has confirmed that the 550-pound pig crushed the farmer to death.
Guiyang Evening News quoted her cousin as saying that her cousin's legs were bloodied and bruised.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed him was not of Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so as not to attack others while police were gathering evidence from the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this is rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig hit a Welsh farmer with a tractor, but his wife later drove him away.
When a piggery oregano farmer was eaten raw in 2012, a mantoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
They just get drunk.
They're so cute, they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to value them.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it passes over the frozen waters off the northern coast of Mexico
However, Rosa is expected to cause torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
At 5am Eastern Time on Sunday, Rosa's wind speed was 85 miles per hour, which is a Category 1 hurricane, and its location is 385 miles southwest of Punta Ogunya, Mexico.
It is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a tarp is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastwards towards the west coast of the United States, while Rosa is moving toward a Baja California surface on Monday as a tropical storm pushes Hurricane Irma northwards to the southwestern United States.
It is expected to rain by 10 inches in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the moisture will bring heavy rain to the south-west areas in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will lead to dangerous flood relays, debris spills, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep drizzle will bring down the rainfall rate to 2 to 3 inches per hour at some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Aarhus.
In some parts of the south-west, rain is likely to be 2 to 4 inches over most parts, especially Aarjuna.
Due to the fast changing conditions due to the nature of rainfall and dispersal, flood rails are likely to be affected.
Due to the risk of rain, it would be extremely unwise to advise to go out on foot in the desert.
Heavy rain can turn the watercourses into angry rivers, and thunderstorms with lightning will cause strong winds and surrounding clouds.
The storm is expected to bring heavy rain to parts of the southern California coast.
In total, more than half an inch of rain is possible, which can cause fulcrum from soil erosion on roads and highways.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
Some of the scattered drizzles will begin to move towards Aarhus on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and the rain will extend further on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rain is expected to continue into Tuesday and continue into Wednesday.
In October, extreme temperature fluctuations can be seen across the United States, while the North Pole cools, but the polar regions remain quite warm.
This leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
The dramatic temperature difference in Central America on Sunday is a great example of this.
There will be a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will again increase and expand.
The beginning of October is likely to be warm in most parts of the central and eastern United States and from the southern plains to parts of the north-east, temperatures may reach 80 degrees.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 80 on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast is showing higher chances of above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. for the first five days of October.
More than 20 million people have heard of Brittany.
Supreme Court-nominated judge Brett Canewa and the woman who has accused him of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, testified on Tuesday on six television networks watched by more than 20 million people.
Meanwhile, political tensions are still simmering, and broadcasters have disrupted their regular programs for the last minute scenario that took place on Friday under which Arson's Senator Jeff Flake drafted a deal to investigate allegations by the FBI for a week.
Ms Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was 100 percent sure that Kaniva, in an inebriated state during a high school party, tried to grab her and take her clothes off.
Canova said during an emotional testimony that he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing, according to Nielsen's report on Friday.
The company was counting average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not available for other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which showed it.
And Nelson usually has trouble measuring the number of people he sees in offices.
From this point of view, his audience was the size of a play-off match or an Academy Award.
Nielsen told Fox News Channel, whose participants strongly supported Kenya's appointment, stayed ahead of all networks during the day's hearings with an average viewership of 5.69 million.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nelson reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC's 2.94 million, MSNBC's 2.89 million, and CNN's 2.52 million viewers.
There was still interest in the hearing.
Fleck was the main character in the play on Friday.
After a statement was issued by the moderate Republican office to vote for Kenya, CNN and CBS cameras filmed him on Friday morning in a condition that protesters were running at him as soon as he tried to climb an elevator to a court committee hearing.
CNN was shown directly on the scene as she stood looking down for several minutes as she was being severely criticized.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
"Do you think that he speaks the truth to the people?
He said, “You have a lot of women in your life.
Flake said his office had issued a statement and added that he had more to say at the committee's hearing before the elevator was closed.
Cable and broadcast networks were all broadcasting the event live, when the court committee was to hold a vote to send Kenya's nomination to the full Senate for voting.
Flake, however, said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against Keniva next week, which minority Democrats have been pushing.
Flake was convinced after a conversation with his friend Democratic Senator Chris Cones.
After discussions with Conan and later several other senators, Fleck made his decision.
Flake's election was significant, as it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Kenya without an investigation.
President Trump has ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "politicising" Britain's future and harming national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with his interview on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson reiterated his criticism of his Chequers plan for Brexit and said the UK and the EU's proposal to collect tariffs was "completely far-fetched."
Wednesbury shooting: Police arrest Dayton Simpson on suspicion of murder of LSU player
Police arrested a man on suspicion of shooting and killing a 20-year-old basketball player Wade Sims in LSU.
The Baton Rouge police department said 20-year-old Ditton Simpson had been arrested and jailed for second-degree murder.
Authorities have released a video of the beating between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims's thighs were lost during the fighting.
Police were called to the scene and found the DNA of the suspect.
After interrogation with Simpson, police said he had confessed to shooting at Wade in a fatal manner.
The lawyer reported that his bail was set at $350,000.
The Coroner's office of East Baton Rouge Parish released an initial report on Friday and said that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
The department appreciated the cooperation of the Louisiana State Police's task force, the state police's crime lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for assisting in the investigation for the arrest.
The LSU athletic director, Joe Elifa, thanked the area's enforcement law enforcement agencies for showing "life-saving in providing justice."
Sam was 20 years old.
The six-foot six-foot forward baton fell into a foul, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that Team Wade's death was "unfortunate" and "in shock."
He said that's what he's always worried about.
Heavy rain in Mexico City.
The lava from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from volcanoes when it began to erupt, recording 183 gas and soil emissions over the course of 24 hours.
The center is monitoring a number of shocks and forward sounds in it.
Images on social media showed mud on car glass in areas of Mexico City, such as Zucchini.
Geologists have observed an increase in volcanic activity following a 7.1-magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017, 45 miles (72 km) from the capital.
The "Don Guo" volcano has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of Independence Day
Six people have been arrested following clashes between pro-independence protesters and police in Barcelona on Saturday, and thousands from both sides took part in demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's independence.
A group of separatists, wearing masks, threw eggs and powder paint on the police, clouding the streets with dust that usually attracts tourists.
Later, clashes also broke out between the protesters and police charged with batons to stop the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence factions chanted "no forgetting, no forgiveness", while unionist protesters chanted "Spain is alive."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries, according to the local press.
The October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, and the separatist Catalans celebrating it a year later, continues to be a source of tension in the region with a sense of independence.
Voters voted in favor of independence with the overwhelming majority, if the turnout remained low, and opponents of the separation boycotted most of the voting.
About 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop polling at polling stations in the region during violent clashes, according to Catalan officials.
Pro-independence groups woke up on Friday night to stop a demonstration in favor of the national police.
The demonstration was held but was forced to take a different route.
Narcissus Termis, a 68-year-old electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about the possibility of Catalonia gaining independence.
Last year we had some good times.
I saw my parents crying because of joy, but now we are trapped.
Despite winning important regional elections in December last year with a low margin, Catalan independence groups are finding it difficult to sustain the movement this year as many of their well-known leaders are either exiled on their own free will or detained for arranging a referendum and later declaring independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Juan Puig, who was recording a protest in support of police over the phone, said politicians on both sides had fueled the conflict.
He said the tension was growing.
Oryol Jankyuras, one of the nine Catalan leaders detained since last year, announced on Saturday that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
He said standing as a candidate in European elections was the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and abuses of the Spanish government.
London: Three men have been arrested for trespassing into a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested for repeatedly hitting a car at a home in London's Dairy.
The incident took place at Ballangard Crescent at around 19:30 UK Standard Time on Thursday.
Detective Inspector Bob Blymanges said the gate and the building were damaged.
A car was also damaged in the incident.
Manga's goal led Livingston's Rangers to a 0-1 win.
The first goal scored for Livingston by Dolly Manga.
Advanced Livingston surprised the Rangers with the win, and was the reason for Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Manga's strike was different, while Gary Holt's team finished second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team is without a win at the opposition's ground in the Premiership this season and will face the Herts next Sunday, eight points behind.
Earlier, the Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has taken his victories in Division Two to six games and head coach Holt has not suffered a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
There's a lot of pressure on the Lions against the Houston Celtics.
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before scoring, while his concussion caused the Rangers all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson made a break-through, but barely managed to take his effort to the front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow was able to expand his range before he faced Ar-Par headers from Craig Holckett's goal.
The host team was satisfied with allowing the Rangers to play with them, knowing that they could put visitors in trouble in the sit-ups.
And that's how a very important goal came into existence.
The Rangers provided a free kick and Livingston started when Declan and Gallagher faced the combined Manga, who scored from the middle of the box.
Until this stage, Rangers' position was dominant but they found that the host team's defense was undefeated and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was permanently eligible.
The same pattern continued in the second half as well, if Jaejoong Alfredo Morelos got a save from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was missed by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Lithgow took a shot away from Livingston's another set play.
Livingston's box continued to cross and clear with a thump, while only two claims were made to the penalty - when Holckett faced substitute Glenn Middleton and one for the handball - which was rejected.
‘Extraordinary’ – Analysis by Livingston
Tony McCormick at the BBC Scotland's Als Der Lamont
An exceptional performance and result for Livingston.
For a man, he was a force to be reckoned with, who continued to perform higher than expected in this high-altitude journey.
Their playing style and team-mates have changed little since their return to their top flight, but the real reward goes to Holt, who has strengthened the team since their arrival.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Holckett remained dominant, offering a very beautifully managed defense while the manga put Conor Goldson and Joe Varal on the bench throughout the game.
However, the Rangers did not have that enthusiasm.
As good as they've been under Gerard's leadership, they haven't met those standards.
They didn't have control over the ball and could only start once against the hosts - and that's a threat bell for the Rangers while they're in the middle at the score table.
Welcome to the home of Urhobo
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at fixing relations between NATO allies.
They differed on issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an later went to Cologne to inaugurate a grand new mosque.
The city has the largest number of Turkish residents after Turkey.
Police cited security concerns to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but several supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Turkish protesters - most of them Kurds - also gathered and condemned the German government for Erdogan's policies and welcoming them into the country.
These demonstrations reflect the fact that some of the German Turkic Turks are hailed as heroes, while others see them as a totalitarian regime.
Detroit road accident: Biker killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place at the junction of Bestwood Street and Elwin Street on a busy street in Deptford, south-east of the city, at about 10:15 British time.
The driver of the car stopped the car and paramedics provided medical assistance, but he died on the spot.
The incident comes a month after a man ran away on Children's Street, about a mile away, killing another cyclist.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road has been closed, and buses have been diverted, and people have been advised not to turn to the area.
Long Larton Jail: Six people were injured in the riots
Six prison personnel have been injured as a result of unrest in a men's high-security prison, the Prison Office said.
The unrest occurred at HMP Long Larton in Worcestershire at around 09:30 British time on Sunday.
"Tornado" officials have been called in to control the chaos, which involved eight prisoners, and they have been separated in a wing.
The officers were treated for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident in HMP Long Larton.
Six staff members were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and their incarceration will be increased.
HMP Long Larton holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the governor of the prison suffered injuries in an attack by a prisoner who was treated at the hospital.
And in October last year, police were called in to deal with a violent riot, in which members of the staff were attacked with poles.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flood rails in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (dry-affected areas may benefit)
A hurricane is rarely expected to affect Arsaceae, but it is likely to occur early next week when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa will make its way to the desert southwest and pose a threat to flood rails.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood rail warnings for Monday and Tuesday from West Aarzona to southern and eastern Nevada, crazy eastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flag Staff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, following its arrival with rain on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that "only ten cyclones (round barrages) have maintained hurricane or tornado status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!"
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that stayed within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, while up to 6 inches of rain may fall at academies in the Mogolon area of Arzona.
Other parts of the desert south-west including Central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, while a total of 4 inches of rain is likely to occur in the Akkad region.
Areas that are out of danger due to torrential rains, the rain brought by Roza will prove to be a blessing because the region is suffering from drought.
Although the risk of flooding is a serious concern, some rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the southwestern region is prone to drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arzona's area is under extreme drought, which falls in the second-highest category.
First, the route to Rosa will pass through the Baja California plateau in Mexico.
Rosa, which maintained the force of the hurricane with winds of as much as 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, is 385 miles south of the Mexican territory of Punta Agonia and moving northwards at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is facing cold waters in the Pacific and is therefore losing strength.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
In some parts of Mexico, rainfall can be severe and pose a risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, a total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to Northwestern Sonora and up to 10 inches is also possible.
Rosa will then make her way east over Mexico as a tropical storm and make her way to the Argentinian border as a tropical storm on Tuesday morning.
The National Hurricane Center said the major threat from Rosa and its remnants would be heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the U.S. desert southwest.
Due to these rains, there can be deadly floods in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous area.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
A young child was found injured in the Accelerator Terrace area of Midsummer Norton at around 04:00 British time on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where his condition is stated to be " stable."
Ion and Somerset police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested from the Redstock area overnight.
Officials have appealed to people to come forward if they have any mobile phone footage of the incident.
Trump says Kenyatta ‘responsible, angry’ for Democratic Party’s ‘responsibility’
Trump told a rally in the Wheeling area of West Virginia that the vote for Judge Keneva meant a vote to reject the Democratic Party's unfounded and shameful tactics.
Trump alleged that Canova had "tolerated the Democratic Party's lowliness and anger" in the process of his nomination.
Canova testified before Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sexually harassing her decades ago when she was young.
Ford also testified in reference to his accusation during the hearing.
The president claimed on Saturday that “the Americans showed the quality and courage of Kenyans that day.”
He told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia that a vote to confirm Judge Keneva would be a vote for a lawmaker with the most able legal personality of our time and an outstanding public service record.
The president referred to Kenya's nomination as an indication of the importance of a Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
It's only five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not participating in this, but I'm actually participating.
That's why I'm going everywhere in favor of great candidates.
Trump argued that Democrats are committed to the mission of "resistance and deterrence."
A senior aide to the GOP leadership told CNN that the first major vote in the Senate on Kenya's nomination would take place before Friday.
Indonesia's earthquake, tsunami, death toll rises to 100
At least 384 people were killed and several others were injured when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palo for a fair on Friday when waves as high as six metres (18 feet) hit the beach at sunset and swept people and things along their way.
The tsunami was created after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Sutopo Provo Nogroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's natural disaster agency, told a briefing in Jakarta that people were still busy with their activities on the coast when a tsunami threat arose yesterday.
Nogroho said the tsunami swept cars, trees, houses and everything else on the ground with it, adding that tsunami waves passed the sea at 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
He said that some people climbed on trees to avoid the tsunami and thus survived.
About 16,700 people have been moved to relief centers in Palo.
The aerial photographs released by the agency show buildings and shops destroyed, bridges collapsed and a mosque submerged in water.
There was also an earthquake on the coast of the island.
The quake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Study and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful earthquake was nearly 200 times the force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
He said that the city's geography, which is located on a long and narrow bay, may have increased the intensity of the tsunami.
Nogroho called the damage "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said some bodies were found buried in the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
He said the death toll and damage could be higher in the 300-kilometre (190-mile) coast area north of Palo, called Dongla and close to the epicenter of the quake.
Nogroho said the communications system was completely destroyed and there were no reports from Donghae.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people were living and that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected area.
He said it was a scam and could be more serious.
The agency was sharply criticized on Saturday for not reporting on the tsunami in Palo, although officials said the waves had arrived within the time it had been warned.
In unprofessional footage shared on social media, a man standing on the top floor of a building is loudly warning people about the coming of a tsunami in the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the beach and swept away the buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage, disrupting the communication system around Palo and making it difficult for authorities to interact with relief efforts.
The military has begun sending relief supplies to cargo ships from Jakarta and other cities, but the victims are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief activities and will remain closed until October for other flights.
President Joko Widodo will visit the relief centers in Palau on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami has risen to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The World Vision crew has arrived safely in the city of Palo, where its employees live in tarpaulin shelters in the courtyard of their office.
He said many homes were destroyed.
The situation is very bad.
While relief groups have begun the difficult task of moving supplies for relief efforts, some have complained that foreign aid workers with high experience are being prevented from traveling to Palo.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, equipment and staff from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of a natural disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
It's not yet.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross, Oluya Ariani, said it was still a province-level disaster.
Once the government says it's a national disaster, we call for international aid, but that status has not yet been given.
After Friday's earthquake and tsunami, when the second night in Palo, friends and relatives of the missing were praying to God that their loved ones were miraculously among the survivors of the natural disaster.
A child was rescued from the rubble last week.
On Sunday, rescue workers pulled a woman alive two days after she was buried near her mother's body.
Gundoon Sabandunu, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded in Indonesia earlier this month.
Among the other people trapped in the hotel, Mr. Mandagi said his students were among them.
"As a senior in the paragliding sector, I had my own feelings.
Gandon explained how within hours of the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spreading to the paragliding community, he had sent WhatsApp messages to Palo-based players who attended the beach fair.
One of their messages received a brownish mark instead of blue markings.
This means that the messages have not been delivered.
Thieves Steal $26,750 During ATM Refill in Levy Newport
According to a statement from the Newport Police Department, the thief stole $26,750 from a Burnx worker while refilling an ATM in Newport on Levi's on Friday morning.
Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the release that the driver of the car was preparing to put more money into the entertainment complex by emptying the ATM.
While he was busy with his work, a man "runs from behind the barnacles employee" and steals a bag kept for delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects running away from the scene, but police did not give the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper has changed his name to "Ye"
Kanye West is changing his name.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, she wrote: "I'm formally known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West's nickname has been Ye for some time, and he has used it as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was made ahead of his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons," the show's owner said.
Along with being an acronym for his current professional name, West previously said the new word has religious significance for him.
I think ‘yes’ is the most common word used in the Bible and it means ‘you’ in the Bible. This is what West said while discussing his album with radio host Big Boy.
It's me, it's you, and it's us.
It started with Kanye, which means there's only one and now it's Ye - which is a reflection of our goodness, our greatness, our anxiety, and everything else.
The album is also a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the few celebrities who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known by different names of Puff Daddy, P Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Lo and Brother Lou.
A former partner of West, JAY-Z has also used hyphens and large letters with and without names.
U.S. pledges not to use military force against Mexican citizens
Mexican President-elect Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country moves towards the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez vowed Saturday "never to use military force against the people of Mexico."
Soldiers killed at least 300 people in a peaceful demonstration in the Plaza on October 2, 1968, at a time when left-wing student movements were gaining ground across Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has promised to help young people by giving monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to crime syndicates.
The U.S. should double its funding for AI.
While China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in this field, said investor and AI practitioner Kai Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments are being made at a time when various parts of the U.S. government have made AI announcements, although the U.S. as a whole has no official AI strategy.
China announced its plan last year to become the No. 1 country in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget will be a good start, while all other countries are far behind the United States and we look forward to the next big discovery in AI.
Lee told CNBC in an interview this week that doubling funding would double the chances that the next big breakthrough in AI is achieved in the United States.
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New Global System" was published this month by Hutton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Synovation Ventures, has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, <0x2B><0x2B>Face.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on the AI system that beat the highest-ranking Othello player in the United States.
Lee praised the former U.S. government's technology competition, such as the Defense Advanced Research Project, the agency's robotics challenge, and asked when the next competition would be held to identify the next generation of visionaries.
Lee said researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
Li said that it is not China, but the corporates that are taking the teaching leaders.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired experts from universities in recent years to work on AI.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
He said that those who have a PhD in AI should be offered a green card automatically.
China's State Council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
Li said that China's National Natural Science Foundation funds educational institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies pay American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is low.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this year DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently spends over $100 million annually on AI research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation on the establishment of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not worked for several months.
The people of Macedonia took part in the referendum to change the name of the country
Macedonians on Sunday voted in a referendum to decide whether to name the country "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name reflects its claim to the region and has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change would harm the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic-majority population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that the boycott campaign had raised doubts about whether a turnout of at least 50 percent would be met for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Raif, believe it is the cost of entry for Macedonia to institutions such as the EU and NATO.
Oliviera Georgiolska, 79, in Skopje, said: "I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, to live freely under the EU umbrella, because it means a more secure life for all of us."
Although not legally required, many members of parliament have said they will accept the outcome of the referendum.
A two-thirds majority is needed to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of corruption as of 1 p.m.
However, the turnout has been only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016.
Gose Tanovsky, a 62-year-old voter in the capital, Skopje, said: "I came to vote because of my children and my place in Europe.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zyev, his wife Zurika and son Dashko are voting in a referendum on September 30, 2018, in the Macedonian city of Stromeka to change the country's name, paving the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of parliament in Spokane, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavdarkov was preparing a small stage for those who boycotted the referendum and drew chairs in front of tents.
Kawadarkov said, "We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join them by raising our heads, not through the service door."
We are not a country, we are a country.
If they don't want to include us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia integration.
Mr Zeif said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment into Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
After casting his vote, Zarif said: "I think the overwhelming majority will be in favor of it because 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO."
He said, "Yes, we will see the future."
A survey by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said Monday that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - far less than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telema TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be above 50 percent.
The failure of the referendum will be a severe blow to the policy of the pro-Western government that took power in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero crosses the entire Brighton defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 0-2 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
Aguero showed his score in the 65th minute looking ridiculously easy.
The Argentinian striker received a pass in midfield at the start of the move.
Before reaching the open field, he left behind three defenders of Brighton.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He dodged a defender and left several others behind at the tip of the Brighton box.
Then he turned to the left.
The English forward gave the ball back to Aguero with the first kick in the box, who used his right boot to beat Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan and threw the ball to the right of the net.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that Aguero had some problems with his feet.
We played for 55, 60 minutes.
And that was how it happened.
We were lucky to get a shot at it.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an early lead over the Premier League.
He shot in the 29th minute.
In the game, Aguero found the ball in the Brighton area.
He threw the ball to the left in a good way.
Sean gave up the ball Stirling on the next post with some stumbles.
The Sky Blues forward threw the ball into the net with a light thump.
On Tuesday, at 12:55, City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League Group Play in the German city of Rahin-Nakker-Irena.
He wants to play more than Rockefeller.
After the Nationals were knocked out of the playoffs, there was no big reason for another start.
But the always-on contender wants to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday but only if there are play-off implications for the Rockies, which have a game edge over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies got at least one wild card with a 2-5 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to get their first Division title.
Although we are not playing for anything, at least we will be able to compete knowing that here in Denver with the spectators and the other team will be playing at the highest level.
Why shouldn't I compete with it?
The Nationals are yet to announce their starter for Sunday, but reports say they will give Scherzer a chance to pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will take his 34th start, threw the ball to Friday's pen session and is expected to play his usual game on Sunday.
The Washington-based right-hander is on 7-18 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
Speaking about the Republican turnout in the mid-term elections, the president cited the situation with regard to his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kaneeva.
What we did in November will be at stake.
One of the most important elections of our time is five weeks away.
"It's a big thing -- I don't stand for it, but I actually participate, and that's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere.
Trump continued, "You're looking at this terrible, terrible extremist group of Democrats, you're seeing it happen.
And he's determined to take back power by any means, you're seeing their incompetence, their insolence.
They don't care who's hurting, and who's crying out for power and control, they just want power and control, and we're not going to give them both.
He said Democrats are on a mission to “resist and disrupt.”
He called the Democrats "sad and cowardly and vicious and liars" and said, "And you've seen this in the last four days."
He referred to Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee's ranking, which led to voices from the audience.
"Do you remember the answer?"
Did you get the document.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It was really a bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labor is no longer a broad-spectrum church.
Those who do not speak out of their hearts.
It wasn't a surprise when the members of my local party voted to condemn me.
Finally, I'm the latest addition to the ranks of Labour MPs who have been told we're not favourites - just because we speak from the heart.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, also faced a similar attitude as she stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the merger motion drew criticism from me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on similar issues on which Jeremy disagrees with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said, "We want to make the meetings inclusive and orderly."
In most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night's GC meetings were exactly the same.
Sadly, this is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of a "policy of kindness and mildness" has long been forgotten, of course, if ever it began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the opposition in the Labour Party is not being tolerated and that every opinion is seen as whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This happened immediately after Jeremy became leader, because with me, who I thought had a political point of view as I did before, I began to expect him to take a U-turn and take a position that I otherwise would never have agreed with - whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I talk in public - no matter what I say - there is a rain of insults and criticism on social media and demands for a rejection start and I'm told I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Of course, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments about me are of a political nature.
I am surprised to see the professionalism and determination of colleagues who endure abuse on a daily basis on the basis of sexual and racial discrimination but do not give up.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this far-reaching policy is how abuse levels have become routine.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote the tradition of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer those broad-minded churches, and with every no-confidence motion or change of the rules of election, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
Over the last two years, I've been advised to keep my head down, not to be so blunt, then I'll be "absolutely fine."
I don't do that in politics.
Since 32 years ago as a student of a school I have been involved in libertarianism due to the negligence of the Thatcher government which led me to reach the end of my Competitive School class, I have tried to do better public service for those who need it most - whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was in any way confused about the stances and disagreements with the current leadership about my policy.
"As for the individuals who made the move on Friday, the only thing I would say is that when the country is moving towards Brexit, which will harm families, businesses and our public service, I am not willing to waste time and energy on proving my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I'd like to give to not only the Nottingham Movement, but also the voters of my constituency: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no amount of threats or political maneuvering will stop me from acting in a way that I think is in the best interest of all of you.

IR 17 - 38 Millionaires: Reaching the Undefeated IR Top
Two late attempts could have created some highs and lows in the final result, but there's no doubt that Iyer had the privilege of winning this tennis premiership's surprising and underwhelming match.
They are now at the top of the table and are the only team out of ten teams that have not been defeated.
In the end, he was successful because of his excellent defense and better ability to take the ball, and coach Peter Morchi had every right to be happy.
"We've been tested in our game so far and we're still undefeated, so I've got to be happy.
Robin Christie of Milrose said: "Iyer gets credit, he's got better chances than us.
Gareth Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which Fraser Clemo converted to score, gave Iyer a lead but Scottish captain Rory Hughes got a yellow card to increase the number of runs scored by Milrose and Jason Beggot put up a try.
Clemo strengthened Iyer's lead with a penalty in exactly half-time. He scored then converted the lone attempt into a score to score 5-17 in the break.
But Mulroney started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's effort, which was replaced by Baggott's, gave
The match was stopped long enough due to a serious injury to Roderick Natt, and Iyer went further on the restart of the game when Stafford McDowell's attempt was changed by Clemo.
Then Iyer's vice-captain Blair McPherson was shown the yellow card, and again Mulroney took advantage of the extra player's presence, and Bruce Colvin tried, which could not be changed.
The host team returned to the game, however, when Stravin Hutchinson was shown a yellow card for tacitly tying the clammo without the ball, McPherson put the ball into the net on a rising eye attack.
Clemo scored as he did on the restart before Kyle Roye collected David Armstrong's box kick and Gregor Henry's fifth attempt to host.
A new career in the gaming industry
Stell Game's star Ford Kernan is set to move into the hosting industry and it has been discovered that his name is among the directors of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star plays Jack Javers on the popular BBC show, which he co-wrote and co-wrote with longtime comedy partner Greg Humphreys.
The two have announced that the next nine episodes will be the show's last, and it looks like Karen is planning to leave forever after Craig Lang.
According to the official record listing, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor has declined to comment on the news, although sources in the Scottish Sun have said that Kiernan is likely to be involved in Glasgow's 'growing restaurant trade'.
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia’s Hague court hopes to reopen the way to the Pacific
In Lapu-Lapu, a sailboat is circling around the naval headquarters.
A blue flag is flying over government buildings.
The text on the naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon reads: "We have a right to the sea.
"We have to get him back."
The memory of missing the beach at the hands of Chile in a bloody clash in the 19th century in drought-stricken Bolivia is still fresh - as well as the desire to sail to the Pacific.
These aspirations are now at their highest level in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for the verdict of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of action.
Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat, said Bolivia has a spirit of force, unity and solidarity and expects a result with a positive outlook.
Many Bolivian citizens will watch the ICJ's decision on the big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's claim that Chile is responsible for negotiating with it to give Bolivia an autonomous path to the sea after decades of disagreeable negotiations.
Bolivia's president, Evo Morales, has also had to work hard for Monday's decision.
He vowed in August that his country was very close to getting back to the Pacific.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will make a decision in favor of Bolivia - and even if it does, it will not change much.
The U.N. court in the Netherlands has no authority to hand over the Chilean territory to them, and has ruled that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
Paz Zarate, a challenging expert in international law, said the fact that the ICJ decision was made only six months after the last inquest showed that the case was “not complicated”.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's goal, it may have been damaged by the last four years.
Zarate said that the issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current administration of Bolivia.
He said Morales' controversial rhetoric has also put an end to the rest of Chile's goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile can continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to negotiate after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Waltz, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, has rejected the notion that the court's decision-making process was unusually swift.
He said Monday was an extraordinary opportunity for Bolivia to begin a new era of relations with Chile and end 139 years of non-aggression for mutual benefit.
Callsadella denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political ploy.
He added that Bolivia would never relinquish its right to access the Pacific Ocean.
The court's decision is an opportunity to highlight the need to forget the past.
North Korea: Nuclear disarmament is not acceptable without the trust of the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never give up nuclear weapons if it does not trust Washington.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly this week.
He called on the United States to fulfill the commitments made at the summit between the leaders of the two countries in Singapore.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is set to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy three months after meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a crude assumption that the continuation of sanctions and the U.S. announcement of an end to the Korean War would force North Korea to take a knee.
Washington is wary of Pyongyang's announcement without taking significant steps towards denuclearization.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about reducing what it considers to be the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Large sized headwear displayed at the Paris Fashion Show
If you want to increase the collection of your hats or completely stop the sun, then do not wait any longer.
Designers Valentino and Thom Brownie have showcased large-sized headwear on the runway for their SS19 collection that graced the style set at the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was full of amazing types of hats, and these designers have sent their great feats to the catwalk.
The most prominent money from Valentino was the high seed coloured hat decorated with feather-like edges, which covered the heads of the models.
Other large-sized accessories include gem-shaped watermelons, a magician's hat, and a pineapple-shaped hat - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom also showed the choice of the strange type of masks - which is being offered on the occasion of Ayn Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips sewn and they looked like Hannibal Lecter instead of modern fashion.
One of them looked like a scuba diving gear with goggles and snorkel, while the other looked like a molten ice cream cone.
And if you continue the fashion statement - you're in luck.
It is predicted that a large number of such bonnets are going to adorn the markets near you.
Large-sized hats made of tannins called "la bomba" have come to the fore after a hat that was two feet wide and was seen on everyone's heads from Rihanna to Emily Ratacowski.
The group label behind this highly ineffective type of hat that spread across social media has brought another major innovation to the catwalk - a beach bag made of tannins that is almost as big as the model it's wearing in a swimsuit.
The orange-coloured Rafia bag at the Jakomos La Rivera SS19 in Paris Fashion Week with a rafia fringe on the edges and a white leather handle above was the most prominent.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect the arrival of large-sized hats and beach bags to the big markets for next summer - because the designer has left such a big impact that it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edwards: Essential Language Skills for Global Citizens
Scotland's independent school continued to maintain a track record of academic excellence, with outstanding test results in 2018, which have been reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools prepare their students for the next and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As a field of education that can develop and apply a best school curriculum, we see modern languages as a popular and preferred subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes into his head."
If you speak to a person in his own language, it comes down to his heart.
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English in building relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent test, we can see that languages in independent schools are at the top of the league tables with the highest pass rates.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages achieved Higher Grade A.
Data collected from 74 member schools of the SCIS showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of German-readers, 69 per cent of French-readers and 63 per cent of Spanish-readers also achieved an A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support the important foreign language skills that children and young people need in the future.
Languages as a choice of subject in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere now have the same status as STEM subjects (science, technology engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the U.K. Commission on Employment and Skills found that 17% of the reasons for difficulty filling vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming more and more critical in preparing young people for their future careers.
As languages are becoming a necessity for more and more job opportunities, these skills have become essential in today's world.
Regardless of the career choice, if someone has learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future because of having such a life-long skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries puts a multi-ethnic person ahead of the competition.
The YouGov poll, which surveyed more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, found that 75 percent of people were not able to speak a foreign language well and that French was the only language spoken at a two-digit rate, i.e. 15 percent.
This is why it is important for today's children to invest in language learning.
Proficient in many languages, especially in developing economies, increases the chances of children getting good jobs.
Within Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
Many schools focus on more classic modern languages while others teach the languages that are considered the most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's preference, independent schools will always have a choice of multiple languages and a teaching staff with expertise in this area.
Scottish Independent Schools is committed to providing an educational environment that equips and prepares children with the skills they need to succeed in the future.
In today's global business environment, there is no denying that languages are crucial to the country's future, so it should be reflected in education.
Of course, modern languages should be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer these choices, diversity and distinctions for Scotland's youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will start playing for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
For fans who want to see Lee Brown playing for the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in Sunday's pre-season opening match in San Diego.
He didn't say how many minutes he would play.
Walton said on Lakers' website that it would take less than 48 minutes to do so.
Lakers reporter Mike Troddle tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' pre-season schedule of six games.
"I don't need pre-season games to be ready at this stage of my career," he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally on his YouTube channel
President Trump is scheduled to hold a series of election rallies in the West Virginia area tonight.
This is the first of Trump's five rallies scheduled for next week, including short stops in friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his election to a vacant Supreme Court seat pending an endorsement vote, Trump is seeking public support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally night and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online through the live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak about this week's hearing for his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has been embroiled in allegations of sexual misconduct and has postponed an expected Senate confirmation vote for up to a week until an FBI investigation is completed.
However, the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help Republicans move forward for the November election.
So, according to Reuters, the administration of President Trump's campaign has stated that the rallies next week are aimed at "inspire volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to save and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
A spokesman for Trump's campaign, who declined to be named, told Reuters: "It's so important for the president's agenda to maintain control of Congress that he's going to visit as many states as possible while we're heading into a busy election season."
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, "will bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get the coverage of the Pittsburgh media."
Saturday's visit will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is trailing in the election polls.
Simon Hyder, a political expert at the University of West Virginia, said it was not a good sign for Morrissey that he had to come to the president to get him ahead in the polls.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA determined to compete to keep their hopes of going to Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, this Ryder Cup was the life of the pair on Saturday afternoon.
The amount of swinging pendulum movement is entirely an invented game concept, but an idea in which players believe from the heart, and so much has never happened as in competitions like these.
Then they will say, "Where is that moving?"
Jordan Spieth said, "He had a six-point lead and now he's four, so I think we're taking that as a small amount of movement.
Of course, Europe has the lead, ahead with four points while they can try to get 12 more.
As Spieth said, the Americans feel that their senses are still slightly restored and they have enough to be hopeful, especially in the case of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played all day together and each scored four to three points.
Spieth has been deadly in terms of putting the ball into the hole and he has set an example.
As their round continued, the shouts of the fans were rising from high to high as they put the ball into the hole with a slight multiplication, taking the match to four out of four - at a time when Thomas and he were two points behind by two points.
His goalie won him the match on the 15th, in the same way that the shouts of fans were raised with joy, in a way that tells you that he thinks the US team is not out of the competition yet.
Speith says you just have to work hard for your match and worry about it.
It's just that all the players are gone.
There are 18 holes remaining.
The only players to score more points than Spyth and Thomas in the last two days are Francisco Molinari and Tommy Flatwood, a Muslim story of the Ryder Cup.
The European team is amazing but this desirable pair is perfect and they do not expect any mistakes.
"Mollywood" was the only couple who didn't shoot a single bogey on Saturday afternoons, but they also saved bogies on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and again on Friday mornings.
The race and the way their energy flows through and through this stormy crowd of spectators reinforces the belief that they are the only players who will be able to compete on Sunday and that they will not have a popular player other than Fleetwood or Molinari who can ensure the European team's possible victory when the sun sets on the Le Golf National.
The two are in different places together.
The beauty of Europe is in the air.
Boba Watson and Webb Simpson were the heroes of the morning's Foreballs when they were paired up with Alex Noreen.
In the first nine holes, a boogie and two doubles dropped the Spanish and Swedish pair into a hole from which they could never come close to getting out.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one to help you get out of the hole.
The interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy turns into a moment are great for watching the morning four-ball and the afternoon four-sims.
So far, the European team has shown a good game as a team and maintained its lead until the last day but this Forcems session has shown that the team also has the courage to compete in the USA, which some people as special as the State side have been suspecting.
Europe won 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
After a 10-6 lead in the Four Balls and Four Sims matches on Saturday over the United States, Europe will appear with a clear lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The passionate duo of Tommy Flatwood and Francisco Molinari began with two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods and have taken their tally to four points so far at Le Golf National.
Thomas Byron's European team, which has struggled to keep up with its trophy lost in Heseltine two years ago, dominated the U.S. team in the morning's Foreballs competition and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. put up more resistance and won two matches, but could not fill the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Flatwood is the first rookie (newcomer) of the European team to score four points in a row while pairing with Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood," the first pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their opening four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reid in the Four Balls, they beat the best of the two combined to beat Khordad Woods and American Rocky Bryson DeChambeau by a much stronger 5&4.
Woods, who was hardly successful in two matches on Saturday, made a one-pointed spectacle, but he has lost 19 of his four-balls and four-sims matches and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested in the morning's Four Balls competition, returned to accompany Henrik Stinson in the Four Sims and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - whose world rankings are first and third - by 2&1.
The European team could not keep up on a pleasant and windy day in the south-west region of Paris.
Three-time major championship winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a standard for Americans with two points on Saturday.
He won by a 2&1 over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Polter in the Four Balls, and later defeated Polter and Meckler by 4&3 after losing two opening holes in the Four Sims.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team returned to the game after a four-point loss going into the singles, although Furyk's team only needed to equalize the match to maintain the trophy.
After being in second place for two days, however, it looks like the counter-attack will be out of their reach on Sunday.
North Korea says it is "unilaterally unarmed" without confidence building.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was undermining his country's confidence in the United States and that there was no question that his country would unilaterally withdraw from its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong-ho told the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "substantial good-will measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said: "We don't see any reaction from the United States.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under no circumstances will we be unilaterally disarmed first.
While Ri reiterated North Korea's complaints about Washington's resistance to its "phased" nuclear weapons strategy, his statement is notable in that he did not reject unilateral disarmament at all, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri cited a joint statement issued after the first summit meeting between the current US president and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to make efforts to "cleanse the Korean region of nuclear weapons" while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea wants an official end to the Korean War of 1953-1950, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The U.S. insists on "first deterrence nuclear weapons" and is forcefully raising the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal and even objecting to a "declaration of war," Ri said.
The idea that restrictions can force us to take a knee is a crude notion of people who don't know about us.
The problem, however, is that the frequency of restrictions is increasing mistrust.
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president has previously highlighted at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister specifically mentioned three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, and added: "If South Korea were the party to this denuclearization issue, not the United States, there would be no such denuclearization in the Korean region."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ree's speech was dramatically different from last year's speech, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the U.S. soil with North Korean rockets had become "negligible" after "Mr. Satanic President" Trump described Kim as "a man with a rocket on a suicide mission."
Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised the U.N. for taking steps toward denuclearization this year, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea destroys its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he doesn't have a time frame for that, no matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.
China and Russia have argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the actions taken by the UN Security Council.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue with intensity and without pause until we achieve the goal of a complete, final, and verifiable denuclearization."
The Security Council has increased sanctions on North Korea by consensus since 2006 in an effort to withhold funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ray on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not been good.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, but only hours later North Korea condemned him for making "guns-like demands."
North Korea also promised to dismantle a missile-making facility and a nuclear complex at a meeting with Moon later this month if the United States takes "responsive measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "responsible measures" he wanted included security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take part in the course of getting enough sleep
Harvard University has encouraged all its undergraduate students to get more sleep this year as part of a new course to counter the growing masculinity tradition of "waking up all night" with caffeine.
An educationist found that students at the world's number one university are often unaware when it comes to the most basic things such as how to take care of themselves.
The course, developed by Charles Cezler, a professor of dream medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, is said to be the first of its kind in the United States.
After making a speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on the reading process, they were motivated to start this course.
He said: “When I got to the end of this speech, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I being told this when I am in my senior year?’
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - a fact that surprised me.
This course, which was launched for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleeping habits help with academic and sports performance as well as improve their general well-being.
Paul Breira, a professor of mental health at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding out that students suffer from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive tutorials.
One section features an image of the hostel room, in which students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects sports performance and the importance of sleeping habits.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
Paul Cezler added, "We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately."
However, we believe they have a right to know - just like you have a right to know about its effects on health when choosing to smoke.
The tradition of being proud to "wake up all night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Making sure you get enough sleep should be a 'secret weapon' for students to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety - even to avoid obesity, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of hunger, which makes them feel constantly hungry.
Raymond Soo, a 19-year-old California student who is studying chemical and physical biology, has helped Professor Paul Cezler develop the course, having taken one of his classes during his first year at Harvard last year.
He stated that the course opened his eyes and created a desire to try to start the course on the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step is to complete a similar educational program for all postgraduate students before they join a competitive institution.
Professor Seisler recommended that students should consider when to go to bed and when to wake up, and should be aware of the side effects of the 'blue light' emitted from electronic screens and LED illumination.
Livingston's Rangers win by one point: Manga beat Gerard's players by a goal
The Rangers suffered another blow of worry when a double by Dolly Manga defeated Steven Gerrard's undefeated team by a goal to zero in Livingston.
Ibrox's team was looking to record its first win after a 4-1 win in St. Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team inflicted its second defeat on Gerard as manager in 18 games and kept his team just eight points away from securing the leadbrokes Premiership leaders Harts.
Manga scored seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers team, who were not enthusiastic, could never defeat him.
While the Rangers are now in sixth place, Livingston has jumped to third and is only behind Hibernian by a goal difference.
There may be more trouble for Gerard when he suffered a head injury by throwing something from the apparent other end on the Linesmen's Column sprains.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, reaching the semifinals of the Iyer Betford Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same Livi 11 who scored a point from Herts last week and he would have been happy with the way his rotation slowed down the opponents at every turn.
The Rangers might have dominated, but Livingston kept the ball under his control.
They could score within just two minutes of the start of the game when Scott Pitman gave up the ball in Alan McGregor's goal due to Manga's first dismissal, but the midfielder saved on time.
Free-kick captain Craig Hallket reached the distance of the Kigan Jacobs, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow threw the ball only to the back post.
The Rangers must have taken control of the game, but could only hope instead of believing about their game in the final third.
Alfredo Murillos certainly felt he would get a penalty on the quarter-hour mark when a collision between him and Steven Lawless occurred, but referee Steven Thomson rejected Colombia's appeals.
The Rangers could only shoot two shots on target in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not face any major trouble from Lassana Colby's header and a weak shot from Ovi Ajaria.
While Levy's opener in the 34th minute could have been against the game's home crowd, no one can deny that it was their first need.
Once again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' trick.
Scott Orfield didn't react in time when Declan Gallagher threw the ball towards Scott Robinson and he chose Manga to end his trick with a cool temper.
In the break, Gerard replaced Ryan Kent in place of Colby, and the change showed an almost immediate effect when the winger gave the ball to Morelos but the impactor Kelly ran from his line in time to stop him.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play the game of their choice as Lithgow and Holckett continued to take long shots one after the other.
Holt's team could increase their lead in the final stage when Lithgow threw the header from the corner to Jacobs, but McGregor came on the way and thwarted their attempt.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton made a late claim to a penalty when he confused with Jacobs but was ignored by Thomson.
Title: The Count of Monte Cristo
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" calendar: 136 years ago today, counting, on September 30, 1882, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, an invention that eventually led to a device called the Geiger Counter.
It has since been a major supporter of not only science but also pop culture, as seen in the 1950 movie "Balls of Coronado," in which seemingly unlikely Goulet scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans are actors:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "This is a gagger counter, which is used to trace radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these airfoils in, you can actually hear the effects of radiation-induced atoms in the minerals."
Evans: "Yeah, it's really poppin' up!"
"Hans" Geiger died a few days before his 63rd birthday in 1945.
But the invention named with their name is still alive.
New cancer vaccine system can train immune cells to ‘see’
New cancer vaccine system can train immune cells to ‘see’ and kill them
This vaccine helps the immune system to identify stray cells as part of the treatment.
The procedure involves extracting the immune cells from a patient and turning them into a lab.
They can then ‘see' a protein that is common in many cancers and then these cells are re-introduced into the body.
The vaccine is showing promising results in a variety of cancers.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine had cancer in the uterus for more than 18 months and trained the immune system to identify stray cells.
The method involves extracting the immune cells from a patient, converting them into a lab so that they can "see" the proteins that are common in many cancers, called HER2, and then re-infecting these cells into the body.
J. Berzofsky, a professor at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we now have a highly promising vaccine.
Professor Berzofsky explained that HER2 "causes the growth of many types of cancers," including breast, uterus, lung and gastrointestinal cancers.
A similar strategy of taking immune cells from patients and "training" them to target cancer cells has also been successful in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after his SNL performance, chanted Trump wearing a MAGA hat
That's not a good thing to do!
Fans expressed disapproval of Kanye West during the Saturday Night Live show in the studio after his outspoken performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would fight for re-election in 2020.
After presenting his third song that night, called Ghost Town, in which he was wearing a hat that made America great, he rose against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"The number of times I talk to a white person and they say: 'How can we like Trump, he's racist?'
She said, "Yes, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago."
SNL began the show with Matt Damon in a skit in which the Hollywood star mocks testimony against himself in front of Brett Kavanaugh's Senate Judiciary Committee over claims of sexual harassment made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's Herza Sarai was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock wants to mock the West through this posting.
In addition, West complained to the fans that he had a difficult time behind the stage due to his hat.
"He hit me on the back of the head.
He said, “Don’t go on stage with that hat.”
They've threatened me!
According to the Washington Examiner, he told me then that he told me I was in a kneeling position."
West added: "Do you want to see a kneeling place?" he added, adding that he would "put on his Superman hat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Test the love."
Variety magazine reported that fans expressed their disapproval at least twice due to her comments and the SNL actor seemed upset.
West was brought in as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West had confused many with his song ‘I love her’, dressed like a pirate bottle.
West was backed by conservative group TPUSA chief Candace Turner who tweeted: "Hello to one of the most courageous souls: Thank you for standing up to the mob."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just expressing his personality and it was absolutely stunning.
"However, I have chosen not to reward a person (by buying his music, or his clothes, or by supporting his "fans") who I think is taking its own course and advancing an ideology that is detrimental to my community.
He is free.
Similarly, we are also free," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "formally known as Kenny West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and is following in the footsteps of Daddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy and Puddy.
The name of the fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was Snoop Dogg, and of course, the former legendary Prince of Music changed his name to a symbol.
Man charged with attempt to murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder for stabbing a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Bali Hekamore.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
A look back at the star of Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington
Kat Harrington is best known for her role as Jon Snow in HBO's medieval violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor strongly criticized the ghastly strip tradition of the male-dominated hero and said that showing such roles on screen means that young boys often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Chronicle, Cutt said he understood ‘something went wrong' and questioned how to combat the issue of toxic male-dominated sexism in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Cutt, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, admitted she's serious about tackling the issue.
I'm personally quite serious at the moment about where we've gone wrong in promoting masculinity.
What have we been teaching men while they were growing up, with regard to the problem we are now seeing?
Cut understands that telecentres may be partially responsible for their extreme male-dominated roles in the promotion of male-dominated entertainment.
They said, "What is the creation and what has been taught?"
What is taught on TV, and in the streets, creates a sense in boys that they have to adopt a certain attitude to be men.
I think that's a big question of our time - how do we change this trend?
"It's clear that there's something wrong with the training of young men."
He also admitted in the interview that when the series of Game of Thrones ends next summer, he will not do such a series anymore, because he is "too tired of field warfare and horses."
From November, Cutts, a film producer and his brother, will appear in Sam Shepherd's film True West, based on the story of a robber.
The actor recently expressed the fact that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is one of the best gifts he gets from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the show, so she gave me my future family and a new life beyond that.
Rose played the role of Cut's lover Aggregate in the fantasy series that won an Emmy Award.
They tied the knot in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: 14% increase in new cases in China
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Medical officials have reported that more than 820,000 people in the country have been affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of the new cases were affected by sexual contact, which goes against the tradition of the past.
Traditionally, in parts of China, HIV spread rapidly through infected blood transfusions.
However, at a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese medical officials said that the number of people infected with HIV in this way has reduced to almost zero.
However, over the years, the number of HIV and AIDS cases in China has reached 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was outlawed in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Most cases of transmission of these diseases are due to improper sexual protection in such relationships.
To address this issue, the Chinese government has promised to provide universal access to HIV medicines since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies her staffer leaked GOP senator’s data, strongly condemns ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘conspiracy theories’
U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that one of her staffers published the personal information of three Republican senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles stressed that such claims were being made by "extremely right-wing" pundits and websites.
In a statement on Twitter, Waters said: "It's all lies, lies, and more vile lies."
The information allegedly released includes the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsay Graham and Mike Lee of Otah from South Carolina and the homes of Oran Hatch.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh by an unnamed Capitol Hill man.
The information has been leaked after some time after senators objected to Kavanaugh.
Hill reported conservative sites such as Gateway Pendant and Red State reported that IP addresses identifying the source of the posts were linked to Waters' office and also released information about a member of Waters' staff.
Waters added that this baseless accusation is completely false and an open lie.
My staff member whose identity, personal information and protection are at risk as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations is not responsible for leaking this information in any way.
This baseless accusation is completely false and an open lie.
Waters' statement was immediately criticized online, including former White House press secretary Eric Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote that this denial was infuriating.
It shows that she has no interest in being a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They should not be worked with.
They should not question the motives of the accused.
They need to be calm and calm."
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing Waters' response to the criticism of the Democrats over Judge Kavanaugh, who accused Kavanaugh of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Waters' Republican rival, Omar Navarro, also expressed his views on Twitter.
He said: "It's great news.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted relevant law enforcement and other law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that those responsible are brought to light and held legally responsible for all of their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any and all members of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again - A Critical Review of the Irresponsible Spy by Ryan Atkinson
It has now become a tradition to look at the importance of Brexit in any British perspective new film, but this does not come true on this renewal of Johnny English's action comedy Wicked Amish franchise, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is there a way for us to get a clear picture of how much we're willing to sacrifice for this country?
In any case, the incompetent Joni English with an eye out and a rubber face had a license to freshen things up a second time - and that her hints were more than anything a broad humorous creation designed for non-English-speaking cinematic areas.
He's, of course, a mad secret agent who, despite his strangely subtle make-up, looses a little of the classics within himself, Mr. Bean's charm, and the man who presented only one head of Chariots of Fire's thematic tone at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
His character is originally based on the mystery Atkinson's passenger and international figure who once appeared in Barclays card TV commercials and left chaos behind.
There are one or two good moments in this latest JE outing.
I was so happy to see a helicopter flying over the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and a helicopter flying over the Pacific Ocean.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is on display, but in the comics, he is unintelligent and appears to be made in a strange way, especially with "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now offering self-confidence as a component of the comedy.
Humor makes me feel like it's for younger kids rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's subtle movements are not as focused and modern as Atkinson's silent movie movements in Ben's personality.
The now permanent regional judge is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered the highly secretive web network of spies and is revealing the identities of all British agents in the field. Now he has become a headache for the agent on duty.
This is the last straw for a prime minister who is a heart-wrenchingly weak figure in glory, who is already in complete political disrepair. Emma Thompson plays this partial Theresa May character in the best way but not much in the script.
Their intelligence advisors inform that because every active spy is in danger, they must bring in a retired person.
And that means bringing up Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a schoolmaster in a posh area, but offers off-the-record lessons about being a spy: here in some places it becomes difficult to stop laughing because Johnny runs the School of Rock type academy of spying.
Jonny is brought to the White Hall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long-time partner, Bo (Bough), whose role is being played by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a married man, a Submarine Commander, the role of a Julie Hockey Stacks in which Vicky Pepperdine is a bit unhinged.
So the Queen's Secret Service returns to the action of doing things in the manner of Batman and Rubin, in which Olga Korelinko's beautiful month is faced with Jabin Ophelia Boltofa.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is haunted by the spell of a Wijeya tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: Manous Jason Volta, whose role Jack Leslie plays.
Jonny and Bo begin their story with their funny colored raisins; under the guise of waiters they set a French restaurant on fire; they create chaos by smuggling themselves into Volta's luxurious boat; and Jonny uses the English prostitute Almoyki to create a rematch when he comes from the interior of Volta's house.
Of course, all the breaks are reserved for this last series, but as exciting and stormy as this game is, the whole movie looks like you're watching children's TV.
There is enough medium-sized material.
And as with Johnny English's other films, I'm always forced to wonder if the British film industry can't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party has denied plans for Britons to work four days a week, but says they should take five days off.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a revolutionary plan under which Britons will work four days a week but will be paid five days a week.
According to reports, the company's boss wants his employees to take an extra day off and transfer the savings made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers.
Under this, employees will enjoy a three-day weekend - but the home salary will be the same as before.
Sources said the idea would be a “suite” for the party’s economic agenda and projects that want to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The move to a four-day week has been ratified by the Trades Union Congress to benefit workers from the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a movement that is fit for the party's overall industrial strategy, in addition to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers.
The Labour Party is not the first party to endorse such an idea, but the Greens promised a four-day weekend in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party as a whole does not endorse this idea.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day week is not the party's policy and is not under consideration by the party.
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to present his idea of bringing a socialist revolution to the economy.
Mr MacDonald said he was committed to taking back power in utility firms from "non-familiar directors" and "mufflers."
The opposition chancellor also means that existing shareholders in water companies will not be able to get their full share back, as the Labour government may ‘cut’ due to perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to set up an all-inclusive fund to include workers on the company's boards and hand over 10% of shares of private sector firms to employees, earning workers up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 a year.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh will change their minds
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising questions about whether the Bureau's investigation will force any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pillay asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI would be able to find something that would persuade them to change their minds.
Kennedy looked more babblingy than he did with her from South Carolina.
Kennedy said, "I mean, of course (it can happen)."
I went to the court and spoke to the judge.
After the allegations came to light, I called Kavanaugh and said, "Have you done that?"
He was steadfast in his commitment and thought, and he was of two kinds.
However, Graham's intention did not see any flexibility.
He said that his opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is unwavering and that he should be charged with dynamite to change it.
With Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know that Brett has denied the severity of it.
No one can know the name of it.
It is 36 years old.
I don't see any major changes.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On this week's day, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival in which a number of well-known singers showcase their art and as much inspiration is its mission; the eradication of global poverty.
In its seventh year, several thousand people will gather at the Great Lawn of Central Park at the Global Citizen Festival not only to enjoy the singing of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of its true goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012 as an extension of the Global Poverty Project, is an international advocacy group that seeks to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively working against poverty.
A free ticket to the festival (a different thing if you want to pay for a VIP ticket) requires concert fans to complete some task or "activities," such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful action to create awareness about the goal of poverty alleviation.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been in achieving its goal while only 12 years are left?
Is the idea of offering people free concerts a real way of convincing people to ask for action, or is it another form of ‘clique-ism’ in which people think they’re doing a great job by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizens says since 2011 it has recorded 19 million "activities" of its supporters in favor of demands for different targets.
It says these actions have prompted world leaders to announce more than $37 billion in pledges and policies that will improve the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements generated from its operations, of which at least $10 billion has been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds received directly affected about 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between investors and implementers in the UK and a commitment to "help children grow to their full potential," after receiving 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens promising to provide $35 million to help end malnutrition in Rwanda.
Tracy Alman, Ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018 that "with the help of the British government, veterans, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make poor nutrition social injustice a thing of the past."
The group also said that after more than 5,000 demands from the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding to a project, Power of Nutrition, which would benefit 5 million women and children in need of nutrition.
In response to a question on his website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "It's a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like movements for civil rights and against racial oppression, we succeed, because together we are more powerful.
Some of the performers at this year's event in New York include Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Genevieve Mona.
U.S. could use its navy for 'blockade' to disrupt Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as Washington Examiner reported, that "if necessary," Washington uses its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke has accused Russia's involvement in Syria as an excuse to seek new energy markets at the invitation of the Syrian government.
"I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is because of energy as they are doing in Eastern Europe, which is the southern belly of Europe.
They seem to have ways to deal with it.
He said the United States has the capability through its navy to ensure that sea routes remain open, and if necessary, to shut them down so that their energy does not reach the market.
Zinke was speaking at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategy to dealing with Russia and Iran and effectively balanced them.
He referred to Russia as a "swimming horse" whose economy depends on fossil fuels, saying the economic option for Iran and Russia is to rely more or less on fuel and replace it.
The remarks come at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe to replace Russia, which is a more affordable option for European consumers.
In this regard, officials in the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which according to Trump has made Berlin a "messenger" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the current pipeline's capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin has argued that Washington's strong opposition to the project is purely for economic reasons and an example of unwritten competition.
After a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said: "I think energy should not be used as a pressure-boosting tool and consumers should be able to choose suppliers."
Germany has strongly criticized the U.S. position and reiterated its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kampf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "I am very sad when a third country is interfering in our energy supply."
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in the Holyoke area of Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider taking part in the election.
According to The Hill, she said it was time for women to turn to Washington and fix our broken government and it needed a woman in power.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.
Warren lashed out at President Donald Trump during the town hall and said, "They're taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Warren has been fiercely critical of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed a majority of Warren's own constituency was of the opinion that he should not run in the 2020 election.
According to a poll by Suffolk University's Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of Massachusetts "potential" voters said they should not take part in the election.
Thirty-two percent supported taking part in the election.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's participation, with 38% supporting potential participation and 48% opposing it.
Other high-profile Democratic names being talked about include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has said he will make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin's reference to Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
The 26-year-old Trac Palin spent a year in Iraq after being recruited in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
He told a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that after coming from the conditions my son is going through, I can feel the pain of other families who are suffering from the consequences of PTSD and the wounds with which our soldiers return.
Palin called his arrest an "uncontrollable elephant in the room" and said of his son and other combatants, "they come back a little bit different, they come back a little harder, they come back thinking whether what they, their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the military do for the country is valued or not."
According to a spokeswoman for the Wasilla Police Department, Trac Palin was arrested Monday in the Wasilla area of Alaska and charged with domestic violence, domestic violence reported as a result of an attack on a woman, and possessing a weapon in an inebriated state.
18 states, D.C. support challenging new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to shelter people fleeing bullying or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and the district filed a petition on Friday in Washington to cooperate with the court in support of a challenge to the policy by refugees.
The full name of the plaintiff was not disclosed in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Rights Union filed against federal policy in August.
She said her partner and "sons of her violent gang members" abused her but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers for the state who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as the countries that generate the largest number of applicants for U.S. asylum as they face major issues of bullying and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy on asylum is against a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Ressine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
The petition for cooperation with the court said that federal law requires that all claims for asylum be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim and that this policy is in violation of this principle.
In the petition, lawyers further argued that the immigrant entry-barrier policy was detrimental to the U.S. economy because such individuals could become workers and provide "essential labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to grant further asylum to those fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
Sessions, who announced the policy on June 11, said asylum was only available to those who left their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or a particular social group or political opinion.
Granting asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Efforts are underway to double the number of deaths in the country.
The situation was worse for the survivors.
A 35-year-old mother, Ressa Kosuma, said the situation was very tense as her son was fed up with a fever at a relief centre in Palo.
Every minute, an ambulance is bringing the bodies.
There is a shortage of drinking water.
Locals have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, trying to lift objects that were submerged in water and what had been left.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals affected by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake are partially filled with injuries.
Some of the injured, including Dui Haris, who suffered a back and shoulder fracture, were resting outside the army hospital in Palo, where patients were being treated outside the building due to the earthquake tremors.
Tears began to flow from his eyes as he shook his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
He didn't have time to save himself.
Harris told the Associated Press that he was buried in the rubble of the walls, adding that he had come to the town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to me and my family.
I hope they will be safe.
US ambassador accuses China of ‘propaganda advertising’
A week after a Chinese state newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a US daily about the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited a China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of trying to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. election.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the U.S. election is a new phase of Washington's growing campaign to increase pressure on China, U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a fierce trade war in which they have announced several rounds of tariffs on each other's exports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at exporters in states that supported Trump's Republican Party, such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor and a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a column in Sunday's Des Moines Register that China is increasing the threat by running propaganda ads in our free press.
Branstad wrote that in spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of every insatiable American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid advertisement on the Des Moines Register.
In contrast, here on the newsstands in the streets of China, you will hear limited voices against the government and you will not see the true reflection of the Chinese people's views on China's troubling economic policy, as the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers dodged an offer to share his article, but did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts have warned Republicans are diverting female voters ahead of mid-term elections due to the Kavanaugh scandal.
As many Republicans are defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Lee over several allegations of sexual harassment, analysts have warned he will face a backlash in the coming midterm elections, especially from women.
The sentiment is already very high, and most Republicans have publicly indicated they want to vote on it.
Grant Rehr, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday that you can't ignore these things.
Rehr said he did not believe Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s demand for an FBI investigation at the last minute would be enough to convince angry voters.
Karen Jean-Pierre, a national spokesman and senior adviser for the progressive group Move On, said women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow and November either.
Mack reported that protesting at the Senate threshold on Friday morning, protesters chanted "Nov is coming!" as the Republicans who control the judicial committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
A neutral political analyst, Steve Rothenberg, told the news site that the Democratic sentiment and movement would be unpredictable.
People are saying it's already too high and it's true.
But these sentiments may be even higher, especially among swing women voters and young voters in the suburbs, voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who often don't vote because they dislike the president.
Even before Ford's public testimony in which he detailed allegations of sexual harassment against a Supreme Court-nominated judge, analysts had suggested there would be a strong backlash if Republicans decided to continue the confirmation vote.
According to NBC News, Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week that it had become a "mild omen" for the GOP.
Guy C<0xC3><0xA9>sol, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel that the issue was not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is included in the bench, but also about how Republicans dealt with the issue and how they treated him.
However, after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, it seems that the Americans are divided on who to believe, while the latter has little advantage.
A new poll from YouGov showed that 41 people believed Ford's testimony to be accurate or perhaps true, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh to be certainly or perhaps true.
Furthermore, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh may or may not have lied during the testimony, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
The Guardian reported that following Flake's request, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by at least one other defendant, Deborah Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez, in addition to Ford.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh abused her at the age of 17 while she was drunk.
Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez alleged that the judge nominated to the Supreme Court revealed his shame to him during a party in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web's founder plans to launch a new Internet compared to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, is planning to launch a new Internet in comparison to Google, Amazon and Facebook.
Inrupt is a company based on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to know where their data is stored and what information people are allowed to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal is "global dominance."
He said: "We have to do it now.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Sold's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
This includes a list of contacts, a list of tasks to do, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are available on one browser at a time.
What is unique about the personal online data store is the ability of the user to access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal authority through data."
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt is the concept of the company to gather resources, procedures and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
A security platform currently purchased by company Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, consists of a community of on-staff developers and volunteer coders on contract to work on the project.
From this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were "talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change that would upset all business models overnight."
"We don't ask them for permission.
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
Berners-Lee changed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
While launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee added that he is very optimistic about the next phase of the web.
Bernard von: a ceremony in honor of the priest who received the Victoria Cross in World War I
The ceremony was held in his hometown to commemorate 100 years of the Church of England's only clergyman to win the Victoria Cross during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van won the award on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellinglais and Lehighcourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a raid and he never found out that he had won the highest honor of the British Army.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren in the Rushden area of Northamptonshire unveiled a memorial stone during a parade.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vaughan, said that it was "tremendously symbolic" that the stone appeared exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning work.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vaughan led his battalion across the De Saint Quinton Canal "in a very deep fog and in the most intense firing from field and machine guns."
He later quickly moved to the firing line and led a field gun to the front of his line with "greatest courage" before dropping three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German raid on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vaughan, 72, said his grandfather's accomplishments were something he could never accomplish but was a humble national service.
After the parade, he and his brother, Dr. James Van, led the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band to a floral wreath.
Michael Vaughan said he was honoured to take part in the parade and that "the bravery of an original hero is being demonstrated with the support of a lot of people."
MMA fans wake up at night to see the Ballotor 206, instead they get the Pippa Pig
Imagine you wake up all night to see a little bit of Ballator 206 just because you are missing the main event.
There were 13 contests on San Jose's ticket, including six on Main Card, which were being shown live on Channel 5 in the UK on the night.
At 6 a.m., as Giord Moussaoui and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were shocked when the Courier turned into Pepa Pig.
Some people wake up early in the morning to find that they are not ready.
One of the fans on Twitter described the move on the children's carts as "a kind of absurd joke."
When asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said it was the government's rule that such content was not suitable for 6 a.m., so he had to move to a children's program.
"Papa the Pig" Yes.
Scott Cocker, president of Ballotor Company, said he was working on his schedule to include UK audiences in the future.
Cooker said, "I think when we think about replays, I think we might be able to come up with a solution.
But it's 6 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to broadcast it according to our time on Sunday, Monday.
But we are working on it.
Make sure that when this change was made there were a lot of text messages being received and not all of them were friendly.
We are trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was not the government's problem.
I promise you that will not happen.
"We're going to focus on five matches instead of six - as we normally do - we tried to give the fans more fun and we couldn't do that.
This is a disappointing situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had a sense of being ‘little’ because of his sexuality
Olympique Dior Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of being waist-deep because of his sexuality - but that motivated him to become a successful person.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs program presented by Lauren Lauren Lauren, she said that she talks about gay rights "to give hope" to others.
He said that being a father, he had become careless about winning the Olympics.
Christie Young, the regular presenter of the long-running show, has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a rowdy on Lauren's first program, the Daily said she grew up with the feeling that she was "less than" everyone else because it wasn't socially acceptable for boys and girls.
"To this day, the feeling of being inferior and the feeling of being different gave me the strength and the ability to succeed.
He stated that he wanted to prove that he was "something" so he didn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medallist at the Olympics has become a high-profile LGBT activist and has appealed to more countries at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to ban homosexuality.
He said he is speaking openly because he feels lucky to be able to lead a public life without knowing he wanted to "give hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said it was surprising for him to be caught up in the love of a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black with whom he met in 2013.
The Daily married Oscar-winning Dustin, who is 20 years older than her, last year but the age difference never became a problem.
At such a young age when you had to go through so many things - he went to the Olympics for the first time at the age of 14 and three years later his father died of cancer - he said it was difficult to find someone of his age who had seen so much high-low.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daly in June, and the Daily reported that he changed the narrative about his life.
He said, "If you had talked to me last year, everything would have been about winning a gold medal."
Did you know that there are more important things than winning an Olympic gold medal?
My Olympic gold medalist is Ruby.
His son is named after his real father, Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
The Daily said he didn't accept that Dad was going to die and the last thing he asked was whether he got tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the next row.
He said, "I didn't tell them that Dad wouldn't be able to stay in the next row."
I held his hand when he took his last breath and I stayed with him until he took his last breath and I finally admitted that he wasn't invincible.
The following year, Daly competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew that for the rest of my life I had dreamed - to dive in front of the home crowd at an Olympic Games.
He also created the motion for the selection of his first song - Proud of Heather Small - which kept echoing in his mind while preparing for the Olympics and still makes his rumblings.
Desert Island discs are presented on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 British time on Sunday.
Out-of-form Mickelson was added to the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to restore his form to avoid setting an unpleasant milestone.
Mickelson, who is playing for the 12th time in the competition after every six months, has been added to the squad for the Four Balls and Four Sims on Saturday by captain Jim Favrec.
Instead of being the focus of people's attention, which he has often been to America, five-time major championship winner Mickelson divided his day into working on his game to play the role of a chair leader and overcome his weaknesses.
She has never been able to bowl a straight ball at the peak of her career, so the 48-year-old is not suitable for the course of the Lee Golf National, where the long rough ground inflicts a severe punishment for the wrong shots.
And although the course may not be as difficult on its own, in the ninth match on Sunday, Mikkelson will face British Open champion Francisco Molinari, who has won all four of his matches this week alongside Rocco Tommy Flatwood.
If the Americans, who are at a loss of four points at the start of 12 singles matches, start excited, then the match of Mickelson can prove to be really important.
Favrec expressed confidence in his player.
He said, "I'm going to take a shower today, and I'm going to put my hand on my shoulder and get ready for tomorrow."
He has full confidence in himself.
He is popular and has given a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't expect to play two games.
I'd imagined more than that, but what was supposed to happen happened and maybe that's what we thought.
Like every other player, he wants to be on the field.
He will break the record of playing the most rider's cup matches of the Nik Faldo by playing on Sunday.
This may be the end of his Ryder Cup career, but it's no match for his individual record highs.
Mickelson has achieved 18 successes, 20 failures and seven equal scores, although Favreau said his presence left a lot of fun for the team.
He explained that he is funny, witty, clever, likes to flirt with people and is the lifeblood of the team room.
I think the kids had a lot of fun this week.
There is a lot more to the game than that.
European captain Thomas Byrne knows the big lead may soon be coming to an end
European captain Thomas Byron knows from his experience that quite a large lead in the singles matches of the Ryder Cup on the final day can easily turn into trouble.
The Danish player started his career in 1997 at Waldrama, where a team led by Seo Ballastros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but he won 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 with a very narrow margin when he reached the finish line.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Waldrama, we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost and we won in Waldrama, but with very little margin.
So history and everyone in the team was told that the matter is not over yet.
Today we go to the field with full preparation tomorrow.
Go out there and do everything right.
It doesn't end until you get points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to win this trophy and focus all our attention on it.
I always said that I focus on the 12 players on my side, but we are well aware that on the other hand, we are competing with the best players in the world.
Happy with his players' performance on a tough golf course, Byron added; I've never been in a rush to do it.
We'll have a different call tomorrow.
There will be individual performances tomorrow that will be outstanding, and that's a different thing to do.
It's great to be in the field with a partner when conditions are favorable, but when you're there alone, then your full potential as a golfer is tested.
This is the message that you have to fully prepare the players and take advantage of their full potential.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and show his full potential.
Against Byron, rival number Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than the pair, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three of the four points.
F<0xC3><0xBC>hrerk himself remained at both ends of these unexpected major changes of the final day, after being part of the Fatah team at Brookline, he suffered a defeat when the European team won the "Melina's Charm".
When asked how he managed to get his players to the final day as captain in 1999, he said: "I remember every word of it.
Tomorrow will be our 12 important matches, but you'll want to get to that quick start as you saw in the brook line, as you saw in Medina.
When she moves the amount to one side, she puts a lot of pressure on the middle-order.
We set up our line-up accordingly and keep our players in such a way that tomorrow we will do some kind of magic.
Thomas has been tasked with leading the counter-attack and will face Rory McLaren in the top match and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Flatwood and Ian Polter and other Europeans in the top half of the line-up.
Regarding the selection of his singles, Byron said, "I kept my players in this order because I think it covers the whole game.
A new German warship has been re-launched.
The German Navy's new frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace Cold War-era ships, but that won't happen until at least next year.
According to a military spokesman, the commissioning of the Rhineland Falls, the first frigates of the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery concerns have hampered the ambitious project.
Four ships of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
It is believed that these ships will be equipped with a powerful artillery, a variety of aircraft destroyers and naval destroyers, as well as intelligence-gathering technologies such as radar, infrared, and sound equipment.
Other key features include longer durations of maintenance - making it possible for advanced frigates to be deployed away from their home port for up to two years.
However, Die Zeit pointed out that the continuous delay in these advanced warships would make them obsolete in advance of entering service, which is said to enable Germany to demonstrate its strength across the seas.
The less fortunate F125 frigate came to the headlines last year when the German Navy refused to officially commission the ship and sent it back to the Bluhm & Wassup shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited "a number of serious defects of software and hardware" that would have disabled the warship if it had been deployed on a combat mission.
Software flaws were particularly important as Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships were to be operated by a crew of only 120 sailrs - about half the workforce on older Bremen-class ships.
It was also revealed that the ship was heavily weighted, which reduced its performance and limited its ability to add future upgrades for the Navy.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland Falls is believed to be twice the weight of the same class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to poor hardware, the cost of the entire project, including staff training, has also become a problem.
Its cost is said to have risen from the initial 2.2 billion euros to 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion).
The importance of the problems faced by the new frigates grows even more in light of the recent fears that German naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Battels, the head of the German Parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was facing a shortage of ships capable of deploying.
The official said the problem has become serious over time as old ships were scrapped but new ones were not delivered.
He regretted that no frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class were able to join the Navy.
Research on the Secret Life of Bees by the National Trust
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use natural landscapes to find food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behavior of these flying mammals in a unique way and provide guidance for future conservation activities.
A research study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland at the Inuvialuit Gardens in Westeros, Ross, includes common and supernovae papyrus trellis as well as brown long-eared and doubton bats.
Special recorders will be kept at important places across the region to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will perform the mobile survey using a manual detector.
An expert voice analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and what types of bats are doing.
A detailed map and report of Zad Bom will then be prepared to produce a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Davor, the Natural Protection Advisor for NTS, expressed hope that the results would show which sectors are most important for bats and how they are used for all types of bats.
This information will help in the administrative work of Azad BOOM such as setting up of green cairns for bats and related species and determining the benefits of maintaining forests.
There has been a significant decline in bat populations over the past century across Scotland and the UK.
Their populations are threatened by the construction and development work that affects their apes and zygotes.
In addition to wind turbines and lights, flypapers and some chemical components of building materials and pet cat attacks are also a threat to them.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they catch a prey.
She uses a sophisticated eco-location technique to detect bugs and obstacles in her flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 37 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats extremely seriously.
It has ten trained specialists who carry out regular surveys, inspect the ashtrays and carry out relief operations.
The organisation is Scotland's first and only tortoise sanctuary in the Threave State in Dumfries and Galway, with eight of Scotland's ten tortoise species.
State manager David Thompson said the state is a better place for him.
We have a wonderful place to stay in Three Rivers.
We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of old trees, and good-born booms.
But there are many things about bats that are not yet known, so the work we are doing here or elsewhere will help us understand what is needed for them to thrive.
He stressed that it is important to detect bats before starting maintenance work in buildings, as it is possible that destroying a single maternity pillow in Anjaan could kill up to 400 females and children, possibly a full-fledged local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, threaten or hurt them or destroy their nests.
The Bet Conservation Trust's Scottish officer, Elizabeth Farrell, has encouraged the public to help.
They said, "We know a lot about bats and for many species, we don't even know what their populations are like."
Ronaldo's sexual assault allegations denied, while lawyers will file a lawsuit against the German magazine
"Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of sexual assault against him ""false news"" and said people want to be famous by using his name."
His lawyers will file a lawsuit against German journalist Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
An American woman, Catherine May-Yorga, has claimed that she was raped by Portuguese-born Ronaldo at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that Ronaldo is accused of paying Catherine $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
Speaking to his 142 million followers via Instagram Live radio hours after the claim was reported, the 33-year-old dismissed the reports as "fake news."
He said, "No, no, no, no.
The five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in front of the camera that what he was saying was "fake news."
They want to know my name.
This is a normal thing.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but such things happen.
He smiled and said, "I'm a happy person and everything is going well."
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for the charges, which he described as "unacceptable reporting of suspicious things in the private sector."
His lawyer, Christian Schritz, said Ronaldo would "claim damages depending on the serious nature of the breach, which is perhaps one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronald and May Yerga allegedly went back to the Players' Room, where he allegedly raped her through anal.
Mayerga claimed that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo sat on his knees in front of him and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good man" but had been overcome by "one percent evil."
The document claims that Ronaldo has confirmed that he had a sexual relationship, but it was by mutual consent.
Mayerga also claimed that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but she later agreed to settle out of court because she was "fearful of reprisal action" and was "deeply disturbed by the public humiliation".
The 34-year-old Mei Yurga says she wants to end the settlement as she is in a continuing trauma due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was scheduled to leave Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and join Real Madrid, and has moved to Italian club Juve this summer with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain will be 'always regretful' over deprivation as carers
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would be "always regretful" if it lost its status as a world leader in the automotive sector after Brexit.
He added that it is "concerned" that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
Mr. Clark said we need a deal.
The Japanese carmaker said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the impact of border delays will affect jobs.
The Bernstein plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis cars - produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90 percent were exported to the rest of the European Union.
Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director in Bernestone, said: "My point of view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production breaks in our factory.
Other British carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about the EU's exit without a deal.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its own money plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Caraza said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, most concerns are related to the risks of the supply chain.
Toyota's production line operates on a "full-time delivery" basis, with parts from suppliers from both the UK and the EU arriving every 37 minutes for order-making cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruption at the border, which could delay or decrease the supply of parts.
The company says it will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "designed to avoid these inspections on the border."
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that we want a great deal that will help us succeed in the current situation but take full advantage of this opportunity.
The testimony of not only Toyota but also other manufacturers is that we have to be able to fully continue our highly successful supply chain.
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, but warned that a long-term rise in costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately affect jobs.
Peter Saussures, who has been working in Bornaston for 24 years and is a United Union Convener at the plant, stated that he is very concerned with it: in my experience, when these jobs are over, there is never a return.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a correct and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again.
The White House said Sunday that Donald Trump's highly significant meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "could be delayed by another week" while the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and threaten Mueller's sovereignty has been a subject of gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of using a device to record conversations with Trump and removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House despite reports of his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he would not prefer to remove Rosenstein, but then postponed a meeting with the Senate Judiciary Committee to avoid a clash in which both Kwana and another woman, Dr. Christine Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation to investigate claims against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week, I see, among other things, that it will be delayed by another week."
But we're going to keep an eye on it and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some reporters will deny the claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
"While the lack of briefings was not due to the disapproval of T-reporters, I will not deny the fact that they understand that," Sanders said.
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
Without making any reference, he said, "The president has more question-and-answer seats than he has in previous presidents: we've seen their numbers."
"There will still be briefings, but if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's obviously much better than talking to me," Sanders said.
We do our best to do this and you've seen us do it over the last few weeks and it will replace the press briefing when you speak to the President of the United States.
Trump regularly asks questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or a press conference with dignitaries.
The only exception is Prince.
This week in New York, the president probably cited a violation of rules and sometimes a different kind of attendance to assembled reporters.
The Health Secretary wrote a letter to EU workers in the NHS Scotland regarding the fear of Brexit
The Health Secretary has written a letter to staff working in the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and their desire to stay post-Brexit.
Freeman's letter comes less than six months after Britain's exit from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed to meeting the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in developed public services.
In his letter, Mr Freman wrote: "The summer negotiations between the UK and the EU continue, which is expected to be decided this fall.
But the UK government is also preparing to deal with any possible non-cooperation situation.
I know this is a very difficult time for all of you.
This is why I want to reiterate how much I value the role of each member, regardless of the nationality of the staff.
EU and far-reaching partners bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie had to undergo emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
State of Tennessee's Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie had to undergo emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during the match against Wanderbilt Commodores (Vanderbilt Commodores) on Saturday and then a 27-31 defeat.
State Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
Red said, "He came to one side and fainted there."
The trainers and medical personnel gave him oxygen by lying on the side of the road before putting him on the stretcher and taking him back for further examination.
An official from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie's surgery was performed at Wonderbolt Medical Center.
Harris added, "There are currently no details available regarding the nature/complaint of the injury," and the state of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercromby, who is a junior, is playing his first season with the state of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
On the week before leaving the game, he made five tackles totaling 18 of his tackles in the season.
More stamp duty will be imposed on foreign buyers buying property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp duty on property purchases in the UK, with the additional money being used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans.
The move will disable the success of attracting young voters to the carbine drive.
Stamp duty will be levied on those who are not paying taxes in the UK.
The Department of the Treasury is expected to receive <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce today that it has been decided to impose more stamp duty on the purchase of property in the UK by foreigners - with the extra money to be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as a move to provide Jeremy Corbyn's young voters with a more affordable home bar with an oath and the impact of the campaign's success to target higher earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and institutions who are not paying taxes in the UK, with the additional money coming from the government's campaign against gold.
Surcharges, which are an increase in current stamp duty, including higher levels that were introduced two years ago when it came to buying other homes and rentals - could be as high as 3%.
The Treasury Department expects the move to yield <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13 percent of new properties built in London are bought by non-British people, making it difficult for first-time homebuyers to step up the ladder.
Many posh areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "terrible towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just two weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty so more young people could buy their first home.
He accused the major construction companies of overestimating property prices by buying land and not using it, and expressed a desire to Mrs May to end quotas on cheap homes to get rid of the "household degradation" in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed reforms, including rent controls and "banana quotas."
They also want to give councils more powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my life to the restoration of the British dream - a life that should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken home market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and live free.
However, it may not be suitable for those who do not live in the UK, as well as for foreign companies to buy homes like hard-working British citizens.
For many people, owning a home has become just a dream, and the devaluation of gold has become a reality."
Jack Russo: ‘My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland’
Sunderland owner Jack Russo says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
Scott is going through the challenge of reviving the 42 Northeastern club, which is currently three points short of the first position in League One.
They went to this summer's Stadium of Light after taking last season's St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership.
"I want to play for my country.
I was given the B-cap and the bus," Russia told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But Scotland grew up watching him with his father at Hampden and that's what drew me back.
However, this opportunity will only come if I succeed in the management of the club."
Russia's predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Eduardo, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poitt and Paulo de Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says that after being rejected advances by Barnsley and Ipswich Town, they had no fear in following such well-known names in such a large club.
"The success at this point will be measured for me as 'Can I take this club back to the Premier League?'
"In terms of the structure and facilities of this club, of course, its place is in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to take him up there, but I will only be successful here if I can take the club back down there."
Russia has just three years in its management career after spending 15 months in the coaching staff of the assistant boss and Hearts in Dumbarton.
He then saved Alva from leaving and helped her recover to third grade, and next year saved St. Mary's from leaving, making her one of the championship title winners.
And Ross says he feels more at ease now than his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mary's and Hamilton Academies.
Recalling Alva's handling of the charge, he said, "It was an intersection in the real sense.
"I thought it was more important for me to play the game."
It's funny because I played well, made a lot of money out of it and enjoyed a somewhat high-quality life.
But it can be difficult to play.
There are a number of things you have to do on a weekly basis.
As far as work-related stress and stress are concerned, I still face them, but I find management appropriate.
I've always wanted to be an administrator and now that I've been doing that, the more my life has been in adulthood, I think it's more comfortable than it has been in my whole life.

A survey has revealed that the best time to pint a drink is 5:30 a.m.
The summer heat wave has increased sales of British low-powered pubs but also increased pressure on restaurants.
Sales of pubs and bar groups rose 2.7 per cent in July - but sales in restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent, the data showed.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultant, said: "Continuous sunshine and longer involvement in the World Cup, contrary to England's expectations, meant that July was seen in the June pattern when pub sales grew by 2.8 per cent last month, except that restaurant sales fell more than that.
A 1.8% drop in restaurant business in June was even worse in July.
If compared to restaurant sales, as far as restaurant sales fell, pubs and bars running on alcohol have been successful so far.
Pubs running on food were also affected by the sun, but not as much as restaurant operators.
They just want to go out drinking.
Sales of similarly-managed pubs and bar drinks rose 6.6 percent this month, while food sales fell by three percent.
Paul Neumann, Regional Sales Manager, a luxury and hospitality analyst, said: "These results continue the trend that we've seen since late April.
As far as sales are concerned in the external market, the impact of weather and important social or sporting events is the biggest factor.
Despite the 4.8 percent year-on-year decline in sales, it is not surprising that restaurant groups are still struggling and this will be especially distressing due to ongoing price pressure.
There was no worse time for long hot summers for food operators, and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures seen in August will provide the much-needed temporary relief.
Total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new ones, were up 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in trend towards brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker monitors the sales of the British pubs, bars and restaurants sector and collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is an industry-recognised benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children - as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed an increase in "fake insta" pages.
This news has increased the fear that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "central" account to show their parents.
One in five children - even 11-year-olds - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed a sharp increase in "fake Insta" accounts - referring to Instagram, a photo-sharing site.
This news has increased the fear that sexual content is being posted.
20% of pupils said they had a clean "central" account to show parents, while also having private accounts.
A mother secretly watched her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, which revealed a young girl who was wishing others "overcome" her.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters of Autonomous Schools and Headteachers Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, half of whom admit they will maintain their private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Bacon said: "It's worrying that so many young people are creating online accounts where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Ally Dual Scottish Athletics Board to have "Athletes' voice"
Doyle has been elected as a non-executive member during the annual General Meeting of Administrative Affairs at Scottish Athletics.
Doyle holds the most illustrious track record in Scotland, and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie considers the move a great opportunity for sports leaders who want to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Ellie is highly respected in the Scottish, British and worldwide athletics community and we are strongly convinced that her on-boarding will be very useful for athletes in Scotland," she said.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to be the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to help and play my part in leading the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter races with his other four Olympic gold medals at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and is now a regular BBC pundit, was unable to walk after a temporary stroke attack.
She wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today, I was attacked by a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Only time will tell if I will be able to recover and to what extent.
It's been a very difficult journey, but I've learned how to walk, and I'm still learning how to walk.
Thanks for the encouragement messages!"
The advertisement of the breast pump in which mothers were compared to rabbits has divided the online opinion
The ad from a breast pump company shared online feedback that compared nursing mothers to a cow giving milk.
To mark the launch of the "world's first wearable silent breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie has surprisingly released a music video ad to show the freedom that new pumps give to mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing to a song in a barn full of buffaloes that says the following: "Yes, I suck my own milk but you won't see a drop" and "And if you haven't noticed, it's not me."
The song continues: "Get her out, get her out, I'll feed the children, get her out, get her out, I'll milk the women."
However, the ad that appeared on the Facebook page has sparked online controversy.
With 77,000 views and thousands of comments, the video has received a mixed response from viewers, often saying it is highlighting the "bad effects" of the dairy industry.
"Using pesticides for this product is a very bad decision.
Like us, they have to be pregnant to produce milk and give birth, except that their babies are stolen from them a few days after they are born."
Elves fit right inside the breast pump nursing brazier (elves/mommy)
Another commented: "Absolutely painful for the baby and the mother.
"Why shouldn't they be used to promote a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Another added: "It's a very sad story."
Others defended the ad, in which a woman admitted that she found the song "humiliated".
"I think it's a sexual fantasy.
If I could still drink milk, I would buy it.
"Pumping makes me feel like a cow.
It's a bit crazy, but it's what I wanted.
He said: "It's a creative product.
Another commented: "This is a humorous ad that targets mothers who pump (often in the workplace or toilets) and makes them feel like "cows" of their own.
This ad is not about praising the dairy industry or forming opinions about it.
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they were dancing in their brazier.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who pump their breasts feel like their own cow.
However, the Elvi pump is absolutely noiseless, has no wires, and fits cautiously inside the nursing brazier which also enables women to move, hold their babies, and go outside when pumping.
Anna Blauner, partner at Mother and ECD, commented: "The Yellow Pump is such a revolutionary product that it needed a fearless and active launch.
By paralleling the women and dairy buffaloes who did this, we wanted to highlight breast-pumping and all its challenges, while expressing it in a fun and relevant way, we wanted to create that wonderful sense of freedom that this new pump would bring.
This isn't the first time Elvis has been in the spotlight.
In London Fashion Week, the mother of two children wore this product and came on a cat walk for designer Marta Jakobowski.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved into a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has risen, although the monthly cross-border rate has remained relatively uniform, partly due to policies and narratives introduced by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to keep children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented refugees and fear that their own ability to live in the country by claiming a child will be at risk.
The threat escalated in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and adult members of their family were to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albanese, a senior official in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor minors alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a past criminal record.
"Approximately 80 percent of these people's collections are illegal settlers in the country who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors and a large number of them are foreign criminals.
So, we will investigate these individuals," Mr Albanese said.
According to asylum workers, authorities are introducing new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month instead of 60 days of detention, which was the previous standard.
Many of them will be presented to the immigration judge through a video conference call instead of presenting themselves to pursue a legal status case.
Those deemed ineligible for release will be deported immediately.
According to reports from asylum workers and the system in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to be upset or sad, which could be a precursor to violent protests or attempts to become a fugitive.
Lawyers said the protections are even more prevalent in larger centres like Torniello, where children are more likely to ignore symptoms because of their large size.
He added that moving to Tent City without giving the children enough time to prepare emotionally or without saying goodbye to friends can be traumatic, with enough children already suffering.
US, French and Turkish ‘occupying forces’ ordered to leave Syria immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouallim also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has now entered its eighth year.
The teacher, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally present on Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly."
He said: "They should be released immediately.
The teacher insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, which has killed more than 360,000 people and displaced millions since 2011.
He said Damascus would "continue to fight this holy war against both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence" until "we rid all Syrian territory of them."
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Syrian Arab and Kurdish forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
There are more than 1,000 ground troops in France's war-torn country.
On the issue of Syrian refugees, the teacher said the conditions were appropriate for their return and accused "some Western countries" of spreading "irrational fear" that has kept refugees away.
"We have sought help from the international community and human rights organizations working to facilitate the return of refugees," he said.
"They are politicising something that should be based on humanity as a whole."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria until a deal is reached between Bashar al-Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.S. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone at Idlib, the base of the last major rebel group, has created an opportunity for further pressure on political negotiations.
A deal between Russia and Turkey has halted an attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
The teacher, however, stressed that the deal had a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that the military action would target jihadists, including the Nusra Front, a group of al-Qaida-linked fighters that would be "destroyed."
U.S. envoy Staffan de Mistura is expected to hold a meeting of the new committee, which includes government and opposition members, soon to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
The teacher explained the Syrian government's conditions for joining the committee, saying that the panel's work "should be limited to the review of the current constitution" and that interference should be avoided.
Why would Trump win a second term?
In line with this logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 if the accounts and scandals end his presidency in advance, as many liberals expect.
This is, of course, "the most dramatic of all."
So far, there are no signs of anxiety.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and more than doubled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million primetime viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has taken the first position in cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers in mainstream newsnights.
"It's a fire that people are pulling towards because it's not something we understand," said the show's director of ABC's drama "Designated Survivor," about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack and then destroys the Capitol.
Neil Scoville, a well-known comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts and a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told them he would vote for Mr. Trump.
He asked why?
Mrs. Scoville told me that she replied, "Because she makes me laugh."
There's a price to be paid in entertainment.
Of course, except for anything on television, the story coming from Washington is Roy Wade (Roe v. Wade), whether immigrant families can reunite and determine the future of the world economy's health.
Not paying attention is a luxury and only the most deserving viewers can afford it.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you spend six hours telling a panel of experts about Bob Woodward's use of "deep backgrounds" for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 Lamborghini Leather Bomber Jacket (according to the Washington Post, "Ghammond-Layed Fabric") and Stormy Daniels's physical look at Mr. Trump's makeup.
I don't think I'll ever be able to watch Super Mario like I did before.
Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," gave a talk about the Trump Show's ever-changing cast and daily sketch spins (that's what he's been doing with N.F.L., the thing that makes him feel like he's getting a fight with Kim Jong Un) and said, "That's part of what he's doing."

When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this month, the weather was warm to 80 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Coai, but he was sitting indoors watching MSNBC recording CNN.

There's a lot of money going into the mid-term elections for the House of Representatives.
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th election is seeing an outpouring of money, thanks to the re-alignment of congressional districts that has led to two new candidates for the same seat.
It recently won the Pots Democratic Representative for a semi-suburban Pittsburgh district, Connor Lamb, who won a special election in another district last spring.
Limbe is pitted against another Republican representative, Keith Rothfuss, who is currently representing the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, which is quite dominant as the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn in January after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally closed to benefit Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has sparked a financial battle between the party's financial backers, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Limbs have become a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a hard-fought victory in March's special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat has been owned by a Republican for nearly a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits have given Democrats a slight edge.
The U.S. decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China and then turned back.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing after some pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and one of his hotels in Panama was even evacuated by his partner to the Trump Organization's management team.
Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that State Department officials had decided to call U.S. chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "as a result of recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan."
But the sanctions were only in response to El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017 for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed punishments, including reduced funding and targeted visa restrictions, could be painful for the Central American country and its rising unemployment and murder crime rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to advance last year's gathering, seen as an important step in efforts to prevent refugees from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted progress at the conference that effectively eliminates any penalty reservations for El Salvador.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence is being criticized for speaking at a conference in mid-October as a sign of a change in management positions at the gathering.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further harsh messages or penalties from the United States.
A White House representative to Bolton declined to comment on the debate, which was described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who were willing to discuss the internal debate on the condition of anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.

What's next could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on a possible obstruction of justice for Mr. Trump, which is now well documented in the public record.
Miller is now reportedly turning to his investigation into whether or not Trump's campaign was complicit in the attack on our election in Russia.
If Congress changes its stamps, Mr. Trump will face accountability at the institution, and probably a jury of his colleagues, before going to the voters.
There are many, if not all, and I'm not saying Mr. Trump's departure is final - at least not at all like his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we all have to make some choices that will decide how long this struggle will last.
In 1938, if only the West had opposed Hitler and supported the Czechoslovakian people in Munich, the German officers were ready to launch an organized revolt against Hitler.
We failed and lost an opportunity to survive the coming years of the massacre.
The path to history depends on such changing points, and the inevitable journey of democracy is accelerated or delayed based on that.
The U.S. now faces a number of challenges.
If Mr. Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, what will we do, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Ever since the newspaper reported that Mr. Rosenstein had suggested a secret recording of the president and suggested he was unfit for office, he has been in trouble.
Mr. Rosenstein says the story of The Times is wrong.
"What if the newly requested F.B.I.'s Brett Kavanaugh investigation is not complete or fair - or if the Supreme Court confirms it despite solid evidence of sexual assault and false testimony?"
And above all, if we vote for Congress in the midterm, who will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will suffer a long, hard winter.
But because of the lessons I've learned in Prague, I'm sure we won't fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was ported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to the Swastika table to light the Sabbath candles.

Graham Dorries of Rangers is hopeful of competing with Rapid Vienna.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against Austria and a draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month will keep them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorries from presenting his first game of the season even after a 2-2 scare from Villarreal, however, he is confident that Rangers can use the result as a springboard for future spectacular results.
The 31-year-old said, "It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team.
We went into the match with the belief that we could get something and we got one point.
We could have made it to the final in the end, but the overall draw was a decent result.
They were better in the first half and we proved to be better and relatively better competitors in the second half.
There is another big European match on Thursday.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a tough match because they have achieved a good result in their last match but because the support of the fans will be with us, I hope we can go ahead and get a positive result.
The last year was really tough and whatever happened with my injuries and changes in the club, but now I have a good feeling about the place.
The squad is good and the players are really enjoying it; the training is also very good.
Hopefully, we can move forward, and succeed by putting the last season behind us.
Women can't sleep on their own.
Despite the fact that the survey participants were clearly aware of how they should be treated, very few were talking to their family members about it.
Nearly half of those surveyed said they had been discussing long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they spoke to their children about it.
"People want a family member who takes care of them, but they're not taking steps to discuss it," said Holly Sanders, vice president of the country-wide life insurance business.
We have to start from here.
Talk to your children and spouse: If you do not inform your family about your wishes ahead of time, you may not be prepared to provide care for your family.
Work closely with your advisor and your family to discuss how to receive care, as these options can be a significant factor in cost determination.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with ways to pay for these expenses.
Your resources for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to cover these expenses, or personal insurance with your wealth - as long as you have the money.
Take out your legal documents: Stop legal battles.
Get health care support so you can hand over your medical care to a trusted person and make sure that professionals follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
In addition, take into account the power of decision-making over your finances.
If you are disabled, you will choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid.

Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
Authorities say at least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, with the death toll expected to rise.
Rescue workers in the devastated Dong Galla area of the communication zone have not received any reports of an area north of Palo, close to the epicenter of a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palo, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the storm hit.
Below is some basic information about the Palau and Dong Gala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palo is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located on the banks of the narrow gulf west of the island of Sulawesi, and had an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dong Gala Island covers an area of more than 300 km (180 mi) northwest of Sulawesi.
Regency Province is an administrative region with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of Central Sulawesi province depends mainly on fishing and farming, especially the coastal area of Dong Gala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in the coastal area of Moro Wali, which is opposed to the Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's hurricane mitigation agency, Palo and Dong Gala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dong Gala.
In 1996, a tsunami hit West Dong Gala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years are as follows:
2004: A December 26 tsunami in Indonesia's northern Sumatra province of Asia triggers another tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of them in Asia.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hits Indonesia's most populous island of Java, triggering a tsunami that later hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake strikes near Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake strikes one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and killing nearly 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake struck the Pediya region in Asia, causing devastation and panic as people remembered the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed due to collapsed buildings.
2018 - A major earthquake strikes the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily put thousands of tourists in fear.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested Saturday on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a woman acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she snatched her phone from her.
KTUU has reported that Palin has been remanded to Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and detained on an unsecured bond of $500.
The network reported that he appeared in court on Saturday and when asked for his response, he declared himself "certainly not guilty."
Palin faces three Class A charges, which could result in up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor with a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Paul.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaskan Court of Appeals.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, domestic violence, and possession of a firearm with intent to commit a crime.
His girlfriend had accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by former military groups in 2016 when she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD, which grew after his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami, causing thousands of homes to be destroyed.
Electricity and communication systems have been disrupted and the death rate is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos of the earthquake are circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered for the Palo City Main Coastal Festival.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for a suspect in the New York City terror attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for New York terror attack suspect Seyfulo Seppo, who killed eight people -- a rare form of capital punishment that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Seppo, 30, allegedly used a home depot rental truck to attack cyclists en route along a westbound highway in lower Manhattan and crushed pedestrians and cyclists on their way.
In New York's Southern District of New York, as part of a warning notice seeking the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Sapporo "intentionally" targeted eight people and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injuries.
According to court documents, both crimes carry the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Sepoo on 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for organized crime, often used by federal prosecutors, and one for torture and destruction of vehicles.
Prosecutors described the attack as "shocking, brutal and thought-provoking" and said it required "substantial planning and thinking."
The warning said, "Sefolo Habibullah Auch Sepou has caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann Lare Decatt, Darren Drake, Ariel Arleigh, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Ferrucci, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n Diego Mendoza and Elijandro Damian Pagnucho."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the death penalty was tried in New York's Southern District.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal execution was carried out in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple found guilty of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago and later executed.
Both Rosenbergs were killed by electrocution on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, the Uzbek citizen did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he was doing.
According to the allegations, Seppo told authorities that he was impressed by watching ISIS videos on his phone for the attack.
Police said he also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, a federal public prosecutor representing Seppo, said he was "really disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that seeking the death penalty rather than life imprisonment, which is unlikely to be released, would be a long-term mental trauma for everyone involved in this incident," he said.
Sepoo's defense team had previously told prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
The Tory MP has said that Nigel Farage should be made in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage hinted at mobilising the public army during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former U.K. leader said politicians were "scared" by EU opponents - when one of Theresa May's own lawmakers suggested she should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union herself.
Conservative leader Peter Boone, who was in the back seat, told a march in Birmingham that if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary, the UK would have left the EU by now.
But Mrs May is finding it difficult to convince members of her various positions, which opponents of Brexit are highlighting in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
Despite Brexit supporters, opponents and attacks from the European Union, the Czechs are trying to keep their corporate plan in the right direction.
The allies insisted they would try to push for a deal with Germany despite the severe backlash - and force EU opponents and workers to choose between their package and ‘anarchy’.
Mr. Bonn said that leaving meant a live rally in Solly Hill that she wanted to ‘force the checkers’.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been co-opted and held responsible for negotiations with Germany.
“If he were in charge, by now the UK would have left the EU,” he said.
The Welsh Borough Assembly added: “I’m a supporter of Brexit but we’ll have to force the checkers.”
Speaking of his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight world wars to be subjugated.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr Boon rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the European Union is absolutely wrong.”
Anti-Brexit Tory leader Andre Jenkins was also present at the march and told reporters: I just say: Mr. Prime Minister, listen to the people
“Checkers are unpopular in the general public and the opposition will not vote for them, it is unpopular in our party and our workers who fill the streets elect us.
Please listen to the naysayers.
In a special message to Mrs May, she said: "The Prime Minister remains as long as he keeps his promises."
Mr. Farage told the rally that if politicians are going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum, they will have to feel "regret and anger"
He said, “It’s a matter of trust between us – between our people – and our political class.”
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell you that we’re not going to allow you to do that.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: “I want to make my political class, who are on the verge of betrayal from Brexit, feel sad and angry.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of a country that has given us success in Brexit, and we will not sit down with China until we become a sovereign, self-governing, proud Britain.”
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit protesters marched in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the middle of the city.
A small number of activists oppose the Tory Brexit at the group's launch this week to wave banners.
Labour ally Lord Edwins mocked the Conservatives on security issues, which he faced with the party's app when the conference began.
“These are the people who tell us that they can implement the IT system for free trade in Ireland and the borderless border, and the whole technology and everything for Canada.”
“It’s a full-blown scam.
"There is nothing better than Brexit," he said.
Warren plans to conduct ‘in-depth consideration’ for presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider" running for president after the November election.
The Massachusetts Democrat leader discussed his future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday, the Boston Globe reported.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been at the center of speculation that she may face Trump in 2020.
Since Trump took office, he had his 36th meeting with the lawmakers on Saturday afternoon in the town hall format.
One of the attendees asked if she planned to contest the president's election.
Warren responded, "It's time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken system of government, and that includes women in high-ranking positions."
LSU's Sims has been arrested in connection with the death from gunshot wounds.
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that 20-year-old Dayton Simpson has been arrested at 11 a.m.
They have released a video of the shooting on Friday, identifying a man who is crying for help.
Sam, 20, was shot dead near the South University campus on Friday morning.
"Vid Sims was hit in the head with a bullet and eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday on 247sports.com.
Wade came forward in defense of his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was present with the weapon on the spot and also confessed to shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-6-inch-tall youngster at Baton Rouge, competed in 32 games last season as a 10-time first-team player and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.

It was at this point that it became clear that Valtteri Bottas had qualified before Lewis Hamilton that Mercedes would play a major role in Team Orders Race.
From the pole, Boots got off to a good start and almost surpassed Hamilton when defending his position during the first two turns, and invited Vettel to attack against his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first and pushed Hamilton into the traffic on the back of the pack, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes later completed the lap and came in behind Vettel, but simultaneously Hamilton went ahead in the race when Ferrari's driver hesitated, risking a double-double in the third-corner defence.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh position until the end of the first lap.
He then advanced to the larger part of the race as he held his tires up for a quick finish and left behind a short riconin for the fourth position.
He eventually came into the pits in the 44th lap, but failed to increase his pace during the remaining eight laps when Reconnaissance finished fourth.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all week and was a really good guy to let go of.
"The team has done an excellent job of maintaining the first two positions," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad physical condition.
U.S. President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dean Finestein's insistence at a rally on Saturday that he did not reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Addressing a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "wanted, disgusting and liars."
"One of the things that could have happened, and the beautiful thing that's been happening in the Senate over the last few days, is when you see anger, when you see angry, mean, hateful and lying people," he said.
"When you see what's going on and what's going on, and then you say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.'
I didn't do that.'
Do you remember?
"Dan Feinstein, did you make the disclosure?"
Remember the answer to that... did you reveal the document - "Oh, what?"
Oh no.
I didn't flinch."
Okay, wait a minute.
He added that the senator's remarks "have we uncovered...no, we haven't uncovered."
Finestein was sent a letter by Ford detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and it went public in early September - but Finestein denied that the disclosure came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," Finestein told the committee.
"They told me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as they told me."
But his refusal was not correct according to the president who commented on it during a rally on Saturday: "I tell you, it was a very bad manner.
It may not be the best, but it's the best I've ever seen."
Defending his nominee for Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the allegations to their advantage.
"They are determined to take back power in any case.
You see their lack of compassion, their arrogance, they don't care who they harm, what they have to crush for power and control."
Elite League: Dundee Stars (5-3 Belfast Giants)
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against Dundee for the Giants.
The Dundee Stars avenged their defeat against the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by winning the return match 3-5 on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead through the first two shots of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney equalized the home side before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalized Dundee, and later Lucas Lindwald Nelson's goals ensured their victory.
This is the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Coffey's players who came up from a weak spot to beat Dundee 1-2 in Belfast on Friday.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two teams in which the Giants won the last three matches.
Dwyer's first goal came through Kendall McFaul's assist at 3:35 in the fourth minute, while Beauvilier doubled the lead 4 minutes later when David Rutherford provided the assist.
Although it was a busy start period, Matt brought Sloane home side back into the game at 13:10 before Cooney's second goal at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first break.
The home side gathered again and once again came on par with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran helped Nelson to lead Dundee for the first time shortly before the second break in the match and he ensured the victory with his team's fifth goal in the last break.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes to play their next match on Friday.
The air traffic controller gave his life to make sure hundreds of people on board survived the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero who lost his life while ensuring that a plane with hundreds of people safely took off from the ground.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing in a major earthquake that triggered a tsunami in Sulawesi on Friday.
The powerful aftershocks have spread to the area and many people are buried under rubble in the city of Palo.
But despite his accomplices fleeing to save his life, a 21-year-old Anthony Gon<0xC3><0xA7>alve Aging refused to leave his post at the heavily swinging control tower at Mutira Sis Al Jufri Airport, Palo Airport.
He was there to make sure Batik Air Flight 6321 took off safely, which was on the runway at the time.
When he realized that the traffic control tower was about to fall, he jumped out of the tower.
He later died in hospital.
Australia's ABC News reported that Air Navigation Indonesia's spokesman Johannes Serrat said its decision had saved hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter in Kalimantan to take him from Balkappan to another city major hospital.
Unfortunately, we lost this morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
He added: "We are saddened to hear about this.
At the same time, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the country's disaster management agency says access to donggala, sigi and bootong is limited.
"The death toll is believed to be rising because many people were buried under rubble and there are others that have not been reached," said the agency's spokesman, Stupo Provo Ngroho.
Waves reaching 6 meters have destroyed Palo, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial ships are bringing aid and supplies.
Ressa Kisuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every moment an ambulance brings a body.
Clean water is scarce.
There are markets all over the world."
John Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working at a brisk pace to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
There has already been an accident, but it could be worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to spend the day and night in every work related to the evacuation.
"Are you ready?" reports CNN.
This year, an earthquake struck the Indonesian city of Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crashes: Air New Guinea says one person is missing after it crashed in Laguna
The airline, which operates flights to the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, while the airline previously said all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a release that as of Saturday afternoon, it had been unable to locate a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the lives of other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water in an attempt to land at Chikland Airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers remained in the hospital and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the US Navy, said the plane landed in Logan, some distance from the runway.
Some eye-witnesses thought the ship had gone ahead of the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jeans said the plane had come down too much.
Jensen said, "It's a very good thing."
Jeans said he and the other passengers on the sinking ship left via an emergency exit route and remained in the deep water to the waist.
He said that the flight attendants were upset and were running and that he also suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sealers working to improve the nearby port before the ship sank about 30 meters (100 feet) into the water also helped with rescue operations by bringing people from the water to the shore by a boat that could be propelled.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered airliner crashes in the past two decades, including those that did not include Air New Guinea.
Investigators have given a timeline of the night the woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors on Saturday completed their arguments in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He sketched for the jury how he used cell phone records from 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tels, and 19-year-old target Jessica Chambers, to gather the movements and sensations of the night of his death.
Clarion Ledger said she received location data from several cell phones showing Telus was with the chambers on the evening of her death, contradicting her previous claims.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers during that time, Chambers said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, so police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Telus was telling the truth that he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time."
Another inconsistency was that Telus said that when Chambers died, he had known him for two weeks.
Cell phone records indicate that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Telus deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
He said, "He saved her life."
The defense will begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to go to the jury later that day.
The High-Breed: What's the Popular Hip-Hop?
A three-person hip-hop group wants to challenge the negative perception of this type of music by adding positive messages to its music.
The Highbread, from Bristol, claimed that Hip-Hop had deviated from its original purpose of correcting political messages and social problems.
They want to take it to its origin and re-popularize the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as Fugees and Common have seen a recent reception in the UK through artists such as Akala and Loki.
Another black hole?
Nanny, from New York, filed a lawsuit against the couple after they were fired from their jobs over a "racist" message.
A New York-based nanny is suing the couple after a mistakenly sent message from her mother, complaining that she was "another black" and was being discriminated against.
The couple denied that they were racist and indicated the possibility that the trial was aimed at receiving "tawaan".
Lance Plasco Flexman, who is a mother of two, expressed disappointment at the baby's new care provider, Gisele Maris, arriving on the first day in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco Flexman sent a message to her husband, "No, another black."
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent Miss Morris twice.
According to the New York Post, "worried" Plasco Flexman fired an African-American nanny, Miss Marais, saying she was not doing her job properly and that she was expecting a Filipino.
Miss Marais was given her one-day salary and then sent home via Uber.
Marais is now suing the couple for compensation and is seeking up to $350 per day for six months of the same work for which they were hired without a contract.
"I want to show them you can't do that," he told the New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the racism charge, saying it was a "reasonable thing" to fire Maris because they couldn't trust her by angering her.
"My wife sent him something he didn't intend to say.
He is not a racist.
We're not racist people," husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
Would you give your children to someone with whom you are going to change, even if by mistake?
Your new-born child?
Try to understand."
Describing the case as a "tough one," Plasco said his wife is due to become a mother two months later and is "going through a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to follow someone like that?
This is not an acceptable practice," said the investor banker.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has been quick to take the couple on social media and criticize their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers fear readers won't meet the speaking bear themselves.
Bond's daughter Karen Jinkel, who was born shortly after the book's acceptance, said of the letter: "It's hard for a first-time reader to feel herself in someone else's place before it's published.
It's great to know what's behind Patton's remarkable success.
Talking about his father, who has worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book about a small toy bear, he said he was quite optimistic about his book being rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books following his death last year was "quite bitter but sweet."
Speaking of Paddington, which she calls a very important member of her family, she added that her father was extremely proud of her final achievement.
He said, "He was a quiet man and he was not arrogant."
"But since Paddington was very real to them, it's just like having a child of yours and having that success: you're proud of them even if it's not your job.
I think they looked at Paddington's success somewhat like this.
Although it was their creation and imagination, they always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, his daughter was immediately taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors were unable to save her life.
"Ned had been calling regularly to tell her that she was in a very bad condition and that she was not expected to survive," Ms. Adenen Leprossi said.
"Then I received a call from Ned that he would die in the next minute or two and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, darling, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication given to her by the doctors to keep her heart pumping was gradually losing its effect and running out of her system.
He died a long time ago, and now he's gone.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it was all coming to light.
I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk, I couldn'
I really had to stand up for myself."
Eventually, Mrs. Edinson Leprosy, who was a paedophile on the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers - who were distraught by the grief they had suffered.
He said, "No one knows.
"My head was down and tears were dripping from my eyes all the time."
It's hard to explain, but it happened during the flight when I had a strong emotional sympathy for Ned.
He needs to know and love me.
I knew how much he loved it."
Pregnant women post cards to prevent suicides on public transport.
Two women, who lost their loved ones to suicide, are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries are posting inspirational messages and phone numbers on the Welsh Bridge, which people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he suffered from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
She said, "I don't want to see my parents the way I feel every day."
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in London, said her son was a handsome chef with an impressive smile.
"Everyone knows him because of his smile.
He always said that his smile could brighten up any room.
However, before he died, he left work because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after taking his own life.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always worried that this thing could have an impact."
Ms. Davis created the cards, "to let people know that there are people in the world you can go and talk to, even if they're friends."
"Don't sit down, you need to talk."
Ms. Humphries, who has been a friend of Ms. Davis for years, lost her 15-year-old marriage partner Mark shortly after her mother's death.
He said: "He never said he was depressed or upset or anything like that."
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was very sad on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look at them or do anything else."
She said her death was a great shock to them, but they had to go through it: "It creates a vacuum in the family.
It's going to break us.
We all have to fight it."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is bleak after the start of the FBI investigation.
"I thought we could really do something like what he's saying - an investigation that has limited scope and time - maybe we can build some unity about it," Mr Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "divided" because of the "neutral grouping."
Why don't Mr. Kewana and his Republican supporters want an investigation by the FBI?
Its popularity is only due to time.
The midterm elections on November 6 are only five weeks away - if Republicans lose badly as expected - they will be extremely vulnerable in their efforts to elect their representative to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has been calling senators and trying to form a coalition to support Kiwana, who works for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI report comes out?
Voting will take place in the Senate, which has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to secure 50 votes on the Senate floor, which will enable Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's denuclearization rate is down.
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Biong Seong, citing data from South Korea's Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 defectors last year - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China and high rates by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A large number of migrants from North Korea have been granted South Korean citizenship.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the war in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it is easier to cross between the two Koreas than the most secure unexploded zone (DMZ).
China considers migrants to be illegal immigrants and often uses force to send them back.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks aimed at de-escalating the stalled nuclear arms race.
The meeting came after U.S. President Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore in June after they agreed on broad terms to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho blamed U.S. sanctions for slowing growth since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way we can first disarm ourselves unilaterally," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a "hijacker" and added that he is ineligible to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Representative Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a "victim" and said he was temporarily ineligible to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
Pelosi responded to Kawana's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, saying, "I can't do anything, but I think if a woman does something like that, they'll call it "weird."
Cavani emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of her statement, Kiwana was extremely emotional and at times walked and panicked, talking about her family and high school years.
He criticized the committee's open-mouthed Democrats for what he called a "ridiculous and coordinated attack on the role" the Liberals were preparing, who were angered by Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it proved that he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself from making such statements and criticizing Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
When Pelosi was asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, she acted backward.
"I would say that if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not going to be able to live not just in the Supreme Court, but in the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kiwana is currently a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or a possible decision against Roy Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearing, Kiwana evaded questions about whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"This is not the time for a curious and biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that amazing?'
Women need to be in control.
It is a bitter criticism of the truth that months and years of anger go by and they can't get rid of it without crying.
Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later, "We cry when we're angry."
"I don't think that's normal, do you?"
He continued, "A woman helped me a lot who was in an executive position somewhere, and she told me that she also cried when she was angry, but gained a capacity that meant that when she was angry, she started crying, the person she would talk to would say to her like, "Maybe you start to cry from my crying that I'm depressed.
But then I get angry."
And then she spoke.
And I thought it was wonderful.
Tears are allowed to partially drive out anger because they have been fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the best memories of an early job in a men-dominated office, where I found myself crying with unspeakable anger when I was caught by an older woman with my neck - a cold-blooded manager from whom I had always been afraid of something - and it pushed me to the jungle of Zene.
He told me, "Don't let others see that you're crying."
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy that they've won over you.
Patricia Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart during his campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found involved in an extramarital affair on a boat called the Monkey Business, and he left the race, Ms. Schroeder became very depressed and there was no reason why she could not have thought of running for the presidency herself.
30 years later, he told me with a laugh, "That wasn't a thought-provoking decision."
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was late and she was far behind in fundraising, and so she vowed not to run until she raised $2 million.
It was a bloody war.
They found that some of their supporters who gave $1,000 to the men would only give $250.
They were surprised, "Do they think I have a license?"
When he made his speech announcing that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overwhelmed by the emotions, the gratitude for the people who supported him, the system that created so much difficulty in raising funds and instead of the delegation, the target of votes, and the sense of sexual thought.
Ms. Schroeder recalled the press's reaction to this, saying, "You must have felt like I was going to have a nervous breakdown."
"You must have thought that Clenicus was my corporate sponsor.
I wonder what they're going to write about in my book.
"Are they crying?"
How will the U.S.-China trade war benefit China?
According to experts, the noise of the opening doors of the trade war between the United States and China was very high and as the war is not over, the friction between the two countries can be useful for China.
U.S. President Donald Trump has issued his first tax warning this year to major Chinese exporters of solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase came this week when new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods came into force, taxing nearly half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has responded each time, imposing a five to 10 percent tax on the latest $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has signaled a shot in exchange for a U.S. shot and the world's second-largest economy does not appear to be in a position to weaken at the moment.
Forced to return to the United States means accepting its demands, but publicly surrendering to the United States would be embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts still say that China can manage its stamps, and the U.S. trade war could have a positive impact on China by reducing the long-term dependence of the two countries on each other.
"The fact that an immediate political decision by either the U.S. or China could create conditions that could create economic hardship for either country is far more dangerous than previously recognized by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate with the Center for New American Security's Asia-focused think tank.
Foreign Minister says Syria is 'ready' for return of refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and has appealed for a renewed reconstruction of the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Waleed Al-Moallem said that the situation in the country is moving towards improvement.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and secure than the progress made in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government is restoring the areas destroyed by terrorists to normalcy.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that damaged their homes and businesses.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
More than 6 million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moallem said the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that contributed to the coup.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
At the 2018 Ryder Cup in Le Golf National outside Paris, France, the European team defeated the US team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5.
The United States has lost six consecutive times on European soil, and the United States has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe reclaimed the honour when Danish captain Thomas Beurin's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the US team.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble for most of the tournament, threw his tee shot into the water in the par 3, 16th hole and lost his match to Francisco Molinari.
Italian golfer Moulinaire was successful in all his rounds and joined the 4 players who have scored 5-0-0 since the formation of the current format of the tournament in 1979.
U.S. player Jared Spieth has been defeated by European team's lowest-ranked player, Thor Beorn Olson, 5 and 4.
World's top-ranked player Dustin Johnson has lost 2 and 1 to England's Ein Polter, who may be playing his last Ryder Cup.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who participated in eight Ryder Cups, became the tournament's most-winning European player with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but I couldn't be patient with myself today.
It has been a difficult year.
So, thank you to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm very happy to win the cup.
It's all about the team and I'm very happy that I was able to do my part," Garcia said after the European victory.
He transferred the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a game on Sunday.
"I'm proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," the 23-year-old said.
Woods lost all his matches in France and now holds the Ryder Cup career record of 13-21-3.
One of the greatest players of all time is the odd figure who has won all the major 14 awards since Jack Nicklaus.
Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Fanau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament, as well as the U.S. team struggled to find ease throughout the week.
U.S. captain Jim Forick said after the disappointing performance of his squad, "I'm proud of these players, they tried."
There was a time this morning when we put some pressure on European players.
But we failed.
Good for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players presented a very good game.
We'll be together again, I'll work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to captain them.
You have to appreciate.
We had a good game."
Red wave update: Concentrations decreased in Penellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest reports from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission show a general decline in red wave concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, conditions such as Pichi Bloom have been reported in the areas of Penellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Shalott and Collier counties - indicating a decrease in concentration.
The red wave of an entire Juban has stretched for an estimated 130 miles from the coast of northern Penellas to the southern Lee Counties.
Peaches Hills is 10 miles off the coast of Borough County, but can be seen in less places than last week.
The red wave has also been seen in Pasco County.
Last week's average concentration in or near Peniles County, the minimum concentration near the coast of Hillsborough County, the background to high concentration in Manati County, the background to high concentration near the coast in Sarasota County, the background to high concentration in Shalit County, the background to high concentration in Lee County, and the Collier County low reports.
Respiratory problems still persist in the counties of Peniles, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Last week, there were no reports of respiratory problems in northwestern Florida.
