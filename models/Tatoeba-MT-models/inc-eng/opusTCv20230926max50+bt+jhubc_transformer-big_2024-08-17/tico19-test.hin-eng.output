Rapidly increasing cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing a similar trend in EU/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom which confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic is increasing rapidly in all countries, taking place at different stages depending on the country.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for a rapid increase in COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On 31st December 2019, the group of pneumonia cases with unknown pathology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, China, reported the novel coronavirus, now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as a pathogen.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date is that 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia and most of these recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops as a more serious disease requiring hospitalization while the remaining 6% cases have an observation of a critical illness requiring critical care.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is ca 4%.
In this study, we assess the trend of cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it to its Hubei province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with Italy during 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, there was further geographical expansion of COVID-19 and currently the activity in the rest of the world of the COVID-19 pandemic has moved beyond this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The 5th edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spitri et al. reported the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were found in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths reported from Italy alone, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and that date.
To achieve cumulative number and cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), only official sources such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and each country in the world receiving COVID-19 cases are counted every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them with the disease in Italy.
As a representative of the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we thus calculated a brief cumulative prevalence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the period 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We also displayed the cumulative number of reported cases in each country during the period 31st January - 15th March 2020 as compared to Italy as on 15th March 2020 at 8:00 am.
Trend of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day brief cumulative prevalence trend of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and throughout the UK, the overall cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and rapidly increased around 28 February 2020 (Supplementary Content).
This was mainly due to a sharp increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK saw a similar increasing trend in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 (supplementary content).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK in the period January 31 - March 15, 2020 compared to Italy.
This specifically shows that by March 15 at 8:00 am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy's cases in just 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend seen in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is growing at a comparable pace across all countries.
This is despite the varying stages of countries, variations in national public health responses, and possibly different case definitions in countries, and different protocols for choosing patients, which must necessarily be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including holding and testing.
In early March 2020, physicians in the affected areas of Italy reported a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
The figures for hospitalisations and/or intensive care units of COVID-19 cases are currently only available at the EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (statistics not shown).
They should however be collected in a systematic manner to supplement the current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The 2010–11 study found a large difference in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in Europe from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
The prevalence of COVID-19 cases associated with 90% risk of acute care bed capacity is provided in the 6th update of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment on COVID-19 with projections for every EU/EEA country and the UK.
Since cases still remain in the herd in some regions of the EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units serve the generally defined regional public, information about cases and intensive care beds should be made available primarily at the Nomenclature of Territorial Unit for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.
The experience gained from Italy and the current trend in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for the status of continued community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients needing health care, especially intensive care, as is happening in the affected regions of Italy.
As pointed out in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, with the approach change from limiting to mitigating, a faster, proactive and broader approach is needed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, because if not implemented in time, the expected sharp increase in the number of cases may result in the decision makers and hospitals not having enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures in addressing the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have little opportunity to further increase their control efforts and reduce pressure on health care to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Failing this, it is very likely that health care systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a sharp increase in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in a disaster for humans.
Like its homogeneous virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms by the same mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is much more transmissible and affects older people and men more than young people.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will cover the basics on epidemiology, epidemiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While there are still a lot of questions to be answered, we hope this review will help understand and eradicate the deadly disease.
Due to the outbreak of Novel Viral Disease, the Vasantotsava on 25th January, 2020 has become an unexpected and unforgettable memory for all the Chinese people, who were requested to stay at home for the entire holiday and for several weeks thereafter.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the 2003 outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); hence, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the related disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread throughout the country and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, there have been more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and more than 3,000 patients dying due to the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is "the enemy of the people No. 1" and is possibly more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), less than two months after the first report on January 7, 2020, more than 200 articles on COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment, have been published, setting the virus sequence apart from many patients.
This review seeks to summarize the research progress on the new and rapidly evolving subject area.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to other diseases caused by SARS and CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, outbreaks in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far with regard to disease prevention and prognosis as well as some of the more pressing questions.
CoVs have been traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, with the common cold generating about 15% of the common cold 4.
However, in this century we have encountered highly pathogenic human CoVs twice, i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, due to which outbreaks were originally seen in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and soon spread to many other countries with terrible malaise and mortality.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in the recorded history of humans.
As shown in Figure 1.1, swarms of pneumonia, whose origin was unknown, were first reported to the Chinese National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
The sequence of CoV was released seven days later.
The first fatal case was reported from Wuhan on 15 January 2020.
Meanwhile, the pandemic rapidly spread to nearby cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, infections were reported in health care providers, which indicated that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was locked down with all of its public transport shut down.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that only 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed cases had direct contact with Wuhan's seafood market, which was believed to be the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health disaster.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation continues to escalate, the final magnitude and intensity of the outbreak is yet to be determined.
A multi-centre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, on 11 February 2020 presented a more up-to-date picture of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
People of all ages were infected with SARS-CoV-2, but mainly between the ages of 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31/100,000) more than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from beginning to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from start to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The original fertility number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI:3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people rose sharply before January 23, 2020, which corresponds to widespread traffic ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, single-stranded RNA viruses.
They can be divided into four generations, that is, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The casing nozzle (S) binds to glycoproteins, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV by its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptide 4 (DPP4) respectively and then merges with the membrane.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replicating the viral genome, the envelope forms vesicles containing genomic RNA virion with glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which are then merged into the plasma membrane for the release of the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new variant of beta-CoV with a genetic similarity of more than 99.98% in 10 sequential samples collected from Wuhan's Huanan seafood market, the epicentre of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
By transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-thin segments of the human airway epithelium.
Human ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV were found to be abundant.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 with greater weakness than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 produces less severe infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also make novel short proteins coded by orf3b and secreted proteins coded by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenesis and block the expression of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>; however orf8 does not have a known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported a cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution in the mix with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the blend, which contained free and closed compositions, was compiled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 blend could combine two S proteins that provide evidence for CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target for drug testing to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Basic and intermediate nutrients
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans by civet cats and camels, respectively.
By a racial comparison of SARS-CoV-2 to other CoVs, bats were considered the original host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, which intermediate host helped in infecting humans by crossing the virus species barrier is unknown and the transmission path is still to be clarified.
Ji, et al., proposed the snake as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans that included a similar recombination with the S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China indicated that pangolins - often long-suffered, ant-eating mammals found in traditional Chinese medicine, SARS-CoV-2 and CoVs found in pangolins - are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic similarity.
However, the prevalence of 1% differences across both genomes is still large; therefore, conclusive results are awaited for concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are mainly not yet known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in artificial ambient dry environments for up to 48 hours and less than 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and up to 5 days at 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2, at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes and is sensitive to ultraviolet rays; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated disinfectants, parasitic acid, chloroform and other fat solvents can effectively inactivate the virus, but not chlorhexidine.
The entire human population generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore more susceptible to the novel virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, notably SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Typically, after the virus has penetrated the host, it is the first time C-type lactin-like receptors, including toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) are identified by the host's innate immune system.
By various pathways, the expression of virus inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) induces which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can assist the virus in avoiding immune responses.
Soon, the optimized immune response becomes involved in fighting the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8<0x2B> T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoVs can block T cell functions by killing T cells.
Trichomoniasis resistance, including supplements and antibodies such as C3a and C5a, is also necessary to fight viral infections.
For example, immunodeficiency antibodies isolated from a recovered patient deactivated MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excessive response of the immune system produces a very large number of locally free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and also multiorgan failure and death in the worst cases.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection characterized by early onset in the herd is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common that people who are exposed to a high number of viruses or whose immune functions are mixed are more likely to become infected than others.
Based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, the 1,099 case study observed that the incubation period was on average 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study based on the demographics of 8,866 cases observed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Adjusting the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period and thus preventing the virus from transmitting to other people of infected but asymptomatic people is very important for the health authorities.
As a general practice, people exposed to or infected with the virus usually need 14 days of quarantine.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often a major and early symptom of COVID-19 with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, dizziness, headaches, sore throat, nasal congestion, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients experienced a rapid increase in the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidity and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and those with high fever should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis, even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 found that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for breathing difficulties and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of swarms generated by transmission from family swarms and asymptomatic person.
By comparison, a 2012 demographic study observed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, far more than COVID-19 patients, 80% of them required ventilation support and this is in line with the higher lethality of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also seen in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it was observed that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the major symptoms and about 14%-20% of patients required ventilation support.
The COVID-19 death rate was 2% as of February 14, when confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
By comparison, the SARS mortality rate as of November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the mortality rate based on a June 2012 demographic study was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study reported that SARS-CoV-2's R0 was 6.47 higher with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 while SARS-CoV's R0 was only between 2 and 4.
Comparisons with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV of SARS-CoV-2 with respect to symptoms, mortality and R0 are presented in Table Table 1.1.
The above data indicates that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, controlling the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The herd usually begins with a single family or a single group or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence or contact with infected persons or patients in Wuhan or other affected areas within the last two weeks from the beginning.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and recovered patients discharged from the hospital can carry the virus again, which warns of extending the quarantine time.
The number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphatic cells) in patients at an early stage is normal or low.
For example, lymphopenia and increased aspartate aminotransferase levels and toxicity were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients with lymphocyte cell count &lt; 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L; white blood cell count &lt; 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood of some patients increased and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, a product of fibrin degradation present in the blood, the level of D-dimer, was increased and lymphocyte cell count went down steadily.
Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and are represented by bilateral macular images or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop abnormal pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis cause a serious compromise with gas exchange.
Type-I and type-II pneumocyte dysfunction reduces the reactive level and increases surface stress, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to bloat and increasing the risk of the lungs stopping functioning.
Therefore, the worst findings of chest radiography often remain in parallel with the most serious condition of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first disease-diagnosis analysis on COVID-19 looked at a patient's lungs dying from the disease, the formation of pneumocytes, the formation of haeline membranes and the porous leakage of lymphatic cells, and the multinucleate polycentric cells that corresponded to the pathology and ARDS of viral infection and were similar to SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as a key parameter for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which could accelerate the pandemic, clinical manifestations began to be used to diagnose in China on 13 February 2020 (which was no longer solely dependent on RT-PCR).
The same situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory investigations and radiological findings is necessary and mandatory to make an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zheng Group reported a protocol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, which is 20<0xC3><0x97>10-18 mol/L to 200<0xC3><0x97>10-18 mol/L without the need for any elaborate equipment, using dipsticks. Artificially detected RS-100 copies per microliter at RSA-2.
If clinical samples are verified, the hope is that the new technology can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to lack of experience with novel CoVs, physicians can provide supportive care primarily to COVID-19 patients with previously used or proposed various therapies for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2.2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Plasma from recovered patients was also proposed for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and possibly also other organs in the lower range, which express ACE2 such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Still, respiratory dysfunction and failure continue to be major threats to patients and are the leading causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is important to relieve symptoms and save lives and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-entrance ventilation and penetrative mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms have to be assisted by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified heart-lung artery technology used in the treatment of life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
At the same time, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and protecting the function of septic shock, and vital organs is also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storm occurs as a result of excessive response of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a type of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These induce immune cells to release a large number of cytokines-free particles which are the major causes of ARDS and polyps organ failure.
Immune suppression is necessary in the treatment of cytokines storm, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, the IL6-anti-monoclonal antibody, have been used for the treatment of cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include changes in T cell directed immune response; blockade of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatomeb; suppression of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids as an immune suppressor, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not useful in severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can produce serious side effects, dramatically affecting disease-diagnosis, especially non-vascular osteoarthritis.
Nevertheless, short-term procedures of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses have been recommended to be used with caution in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
As of the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue given in a vein, has been found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Malburg viruses.
Later, Remdesivir also showed possible interception of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has made the compound available to China to carry out two tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results are highly expected.
Also, barisitinib, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, iopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combined therapy with Iopinavir/ritonavir.
Interaction with other drugs used in patients with these therapies should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and immune production from recovered patients
There has been a long history of aggregation of blood from patients recovering from an infectious disease in order to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from becoming infected.
In fact, the blood of recovered patients has a high level of antibodies relative to the pathogen.
The antibodies produced by B lymphatic cells to fight pathogens and other extracellular substances are immunoglobulins (Ig) and they identify unique molecules in the pathogen and inactivate them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours with reduced inflammation and viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, until specific therapies are developed, validation and clarification are needed to propose the method to be used on a large scale.
Also, despite the therapeutic effects, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokines release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening poisoning.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat critically ill patients.
It's hard to develop and produce specific antibodies so fast to fight a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic code that codes the effective antibodies or examine the effective antibodies to the essential proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases.
However, its effects depend mainly on the combination of different components in a different formula depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM principles.
Most effective components are yet unknown or redundant because such components or their optimal combinations are difficult to extract and verify.
Currently, TCM has become one of the major alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from the severe stages due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Do capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
Among the 87% of patients using TCM, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), many provinces in China saw the highest recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19, while Hubei Province, where only about 30% of COVID-19 patients used TCM, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is quite a rough comparison as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zheng and colleagues published a study to compare only Western Medicine (WM) treatment and the combined treatment of WM and TCM.
They found that the time required for the WM<0x2B>TCM group to have normal body temperature, symptoms to go away, and hospitalization was significantly shorter than that of the WM group alone.
Most impressively, the WM<0x2B>TCM group had a significantly lower symptomatic worsening rate (lightly severe) than the WM<0x2B>TCM group alone (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than the WM group alone (8.8% vs. 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of TCM is still awaited for more well-controlled trials at large scale and in more centres.
It will also be interesting to identify the system of actions and, if possible, clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients experience a lot of fear from highly contagious and deadly disease and people who are quarantined also experience monotony, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, low-oxygenation and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia generated by corticosteroids, can cause more discomfort and mental pain.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric diseases were reported, including persistent stress, restlessness, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, mental symptoms, delirium, even suicide.
Finding and quarantining mandatory contacts as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak; can make people more restless and dirty about the effects of contact, quarantine, and stigma on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals and those in contact with them, as well as the general public.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates about SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are necessary to disrupt the chain of transmission from animal funds and infected humans to sensitive nutrients and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics due to increasing viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and powerful inactivated immune and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Lively-modified vaccines have been evaluated in SARS animal models.
However, the vivo efficacy of these candidate vaccines in elderly people and lethally challenging variants and their protection against zoonotic virus infection are yet to be determined before the start of any clinical study.
This is probably because SARS ended slowly 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and swarms of MERS continue to originate in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the presence of zoonotic sources in epidemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using sub-units of inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant proteins and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for persons with non-resistance is an urgent and important task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulty due to the long-term need (on average 18 months) for vaccine development and the dynamic variations of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to manifest its entire clinical process in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without the symptoms of other diseases.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also related to high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is necessary for health-care agencies to create a disease-diagnosis model to determine the priority of their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies so far reported, the following factors may affect or relate to the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for disease-detection of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
In a study of 8,866 cases, COVID-19 mainly occurred at the age of 30-65 years, of which 47.7% of patients were over the age of 50 years, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly older than those who did not have such a need (at the median age of 51 versus 66), indicating age as a predictive factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: More men than women have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmias.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiosites that can cause liver disease in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease have deep correlations and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been proposed as a potential predictor of disease, medical response and eventual recovery.
The severity of COVID-19 and the correlation of CRP levels with disease-detection has also been proposed.
Also, increased lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes appear widely in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are traditional indicators of heart or liver diseases.
Major clinical symptoms: Chest radiography with other problems and topical progression of clinical symptoms should be considered for predicting the consequences and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As mentioned above, steroids are immunosuppressors commonly used as a compound therapy in infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from nonvascular osteoarthritis with a lifetime disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if needed, steroids should be used in low doses and in COVID-19 patients for the short term.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, many patients have suffered from extraordinary stress during the COVID-19 outbreak, as they often endured the long duration and extreme uncertainty of quarantine and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.
It is imperative to provide psychological advice and long-term support to help these people recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have epidemiological characteristics different from SARS.
As well as replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and, like other CoVs that cause colds, does not produce mild or any symptoms in the early stages of infection.
Therefore, infected patients can generate large amounts of virus during daily activities in the early stage or incubation period with much difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission was thought to have occurred when patients were very ill, while most transmission did not occur during the early stages.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more serious and harder to control than the SARS outbreak.
With the hope of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, huge efforts are currently underway in China, including lockdowns in Wuhan and surrounding cities and continued quarantine of almost the entire population.
While these steps are dramatically destroying the economy and other areas of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, which indicates the ups and downs of the pandemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by the end of March and the ups and downs phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be far more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., set the pattern for predicting the outcome of the pandemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 recovered and discharged patients from the hospital 2 weeks ago have been identified in both mid-turbinate and sore throats which indicates that the identified new virus, like influenza, may become a recurring case.
However, there have been promising signs from China based on the decreasing number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
It was initially predicted to be one million cases with half a million deaths from Ebola.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been brought under control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens in infectiousness and eventually ends or becomes a less pathogenic virus co-existing with humans.
Comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with SARS and MERS is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is also highly transmissible by coughing or sneezing and possibly direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which also creates a new possibility of oral transmission from feces.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases, including 17 patients with other pre-existing diseases and 40 health care providers, were possibly caused by clinical infections.
Therefore, great care must also be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, co-workers, and patients who are standing next to or infected.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing a mask; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series <0x23>1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from potentially getting into the air from an infected person or sticking to the surface of things from which they can pass to others.
However, only N95 (series <0x23>1860s) masks with only 5% virion can prevent as little as 10 to 80 nm of virion from inhaling; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can also surpass five surgical masks placed one over the other, health care providers with direct contact with patients must necessarily wear N95 (series <0x23>1860s) masks, but not surgical masks.
Along with masks, health care providers must wear isolation gowns that fit to further reduce contact with viruses.
The virus can also infect a person's eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered the body through his inflammable eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear transparent face shields or glasses while working with patients.
The general public in affected or potentially affected areas are strongly advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and possibly limit contact with infected persons.
Three feet is considered a reasonable distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These activities are effective measures to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as the new virus for the human world, as reported on 7 January 2020, it may have caused China to be highly cautious based on the deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003 due to the extreme similarity to SARS-CoV.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the director of Wuhan's Centers for Disease Control consoled citizens by saying that the novel virus has low human-to-human transmission and limited fertility and there is no problem in preventing and limiting the disease.
This message freed up the public quite a bit of fear, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival and the delicate time to limit the disease to the minimum level in Wuhan was over.
Disease control agencies in China can learn a lot from this and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be quite careful when making public announcements because every word counts for citizens and can change their outlook and judgment; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for formal information from physicians or authorities; (3) be more restrictive to limit the early stages of a potential pandemic than to try to console the public and improve the system as often as the public is aware of the pandemic.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread to China and nearly 50 other countries around the world by the time of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has led to the frequent occurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to limit the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects men more than older people and women than younger people, and the severity and mortality in the elderly are also higher than in young people.
The death rate of SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are asymptomatic, while SARS patients often do so when they are critically ill, which makes it much more difficult to limit the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients may again be positive for the virus.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Despite such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, many serious cases are yet to be resolved, which are as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic similarity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot reach the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
What was the intermediate species in transmission of the virus from bats to humans?
Without finding the answer to <0x23>1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the transmission and outbreaks can recur anytime.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and then make pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-individual cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How is the virus genetically evolving during transmission in humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, end slowly like SARS or will it continue to happen periodically like the flu?
This is necessary, but it may take some time to find the answers to the above and many other questions.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and bring our lives back to normal.
zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutations and adaptations have led to the simultaneous development of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts (including humans) over a period of thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) that cause mild colds were known.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks completely reversed the situation, demonstrating the destructive and fatal nature of HCoV infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has brought CoVs to light again and shocked us by its more infectious capacity but reduced pathogenicity than its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease and understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs will help us.
Most HCoVs originate from bats, in which they are non-infectious.
There is also information about the intermediate cell hosts of some HCoVs.
The identification of animal nutrients has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
Examining the interaction of CoV-nutrients in animals can also give important insights on the pathogenesis of CoVs in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of current information about the seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of discovery as well as zoonotic origin and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare and see different HCoVs from the perspective of the gradual development of viruses and gene recombination.
The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is discussed in this perspective.
At the same time, the need to successfully replace nutrients and the implications of the gradual development of the virus on the severity of the disease has also been highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are from the coronavirus family, which includes groups of newly-elevated, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses harboring the largest genomes of 26 to 32 kilobases in RNA viruses were named "CoVs" because of the crown-like morphology under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have undifferentiated genomes that have the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicas polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins called nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spikes (S), invelops (E), membranes (M), and nucleoproteins (N).
Many genera-specific auxiliary proteins are also coded by different genera of CoVs.
Depending on the variation in protein sequences, CoVs are divided into four generations (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), most of which are HCoVs in the beta-CoV generation and are subdivided into four genera (A, B, C and D).
Racial evidence has shown that bats and rodents are mostly the gene sources of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the dominant source of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have consistently surpassed species barriers and have emerged as some important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms like colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, generating severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients with a greater likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary manifestations.
The first HCoV-229E breed, B814, was isolated from the nasal drift of patients with colds in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information was collected by detailed studies about HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which produce self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, the concept was widely accepted that infection with HCoVs is generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak, which infected more than 8,000 people with an unexplained case fatality rate of about 10%, is one of the most devastating outbreaks in current history.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak generated a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread elsewhere in the world.
The 2019 Novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm bells are ringing and the world has to prepare for the coming epidemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs are of bat, rat, or domestic animal origin.
Many evidence supports the gradual development of all HCoVs from bats, in which viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic, but show extreme genetic variation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented huge medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Detecting the zoonotic source of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force and bonding factors of species crossing.
It can guide or facilitate the discovery of trace, intermediate and proliferating animal host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 with significant impact in preventing future spread.
In this review we present an overview of the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the ancestral viruses of HCoVs are non-pathogenic in their natural cell hosts, but become pathogenic after intergenerational transmission to the new host.
We will also review the trend of gradual development of HCoVs in which the increase in infectiousness is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenesis.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this perspective.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E breed, which was first isolated from the nasal flow of infected common cold patients, different CoVs were isolated from a number of infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven HCoVs have been identified in the past decade.
A brief summary of the chronology of the history of HCoV discovery (Table 1) will be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966, which later adapted to grow in the cellular lines of the WI-38 lung.
In 10<0x7E>20% of the patients infected with HCoV-229E, symptoms of colds including headache, sneezing, uneasiness and sore throat were observed with fever and cough.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the sequential pathway in the milk-drinking rat's brain and from organ augmentation.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to the infection caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both spread across the globe and are likely to be majorly transmitted during the winter season with the temperate season.
Usually, the period of gradual development of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2-week illness.
According to a study by human volunteers, mild colds developed in healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E.
Severe lower respiratory tract infection appears in only a few patients who are immunocompromised.
SARS, also known as "Atypical Pneumonia," was the first well-documented HCoV pandemic in human history, and the third HCoV to be detected was SARS-CoV.
The first case of SARS may have been identified in late 2002 in China's Guangdong province.
A total of 8,096 cases were registered with 774 deaths as the SARS epidemic spread to several countries and continents.
In addition to the most spreaders, it was estimated that approximately two secondary cases could increase due to each case with a gradual growth period of 4 to 7 days and the maximum viral impact appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially show symptoms such as muscle soreness, headache, fever, malaise and chills, after which breathing soreness, cough and respiratory distress appear as later symptoms.
Lymphopenia, neurodegenerative liver function testing and increased creatine kinase are common laboratory-related abnormalities of SARS.
Circulatory alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increase in macrophages are also seen in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients later require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, many organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, usually with cytokines storm, can also become infected in these severe cases, which can be especially fatal for patients with disabilities in immunity.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy from a relative of the patient who travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, much effort has been made in the research of HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to spread to young children, the elderly and patients with respiratory diseases.
Colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
In the second independent study, the same virus was isolated from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, in fact it has spread worldwide.
It is estimated that about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases are caused by HCoV-NL63 and its peak incidence occurs during early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is related to obstructive laryngeal inflammation, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old elderly man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was also reported to be related to severe asthma infestation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four of these community-acquired HCoVs are well adapted in humans and are generally less likely to mutate to produce highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons as in the rare case of the more toxic subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Usually, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and sustain themselves in humans, they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a patient aged 60 years in Saudi Arabia in 2012, developing acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary prevalence in close relatives have been reported in many European countries and Tunisia.
The second secondary outbreak occurred in 2015 in South Korea with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations of MERS characterized by progressive severe pneumonia correspond to SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal failure, which has so far only been seen in MERS in diseases caused by HCoVs.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported, with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
From mid-December to the end of December 2019, swarms of pneumonia patients related to SARS-CoV-2 infection were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China as a whole.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide with an unreported case fatality rate of 3.4%.
Notably, the case fatality rate in Hubei China is 4.2%, while outside it it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which appear as fever, cough and respiratory distress.
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly escalate into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high nucleotide sequence similarity of 82%, they fall into different branches of racial descent.
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and can contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Compared to the other six HCoVs of SARS-CoV-2 and looking at the asymmetry, there have been many interesting similarities and differences.
First, the pathologic period of HCoV disease and the duration of the procedure are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is similar to those of SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows features that are usually observed during community-acquired HCoV infection, including non-specific, mild, or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also features both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the infectivity of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it is yet to be verified whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases as the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV advance in humans.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
Whether the rectal-mouthed transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in at least some conditions, like SARS-CoV, remains to be clarified by future studies.
It is also particularly interesting to see if the SARS-CoV-2 community can behave seasonalally like cases of HCoVs acquired.
Still, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmissibility, pathogenicity, and persistent spread after moving into humans, will be effective on the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
All four community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted in humans.
From another point of view, it may also be correct that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived the ancient HCoV epidemics.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and humans that develop serious HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
For this to happen, the accumulation of optimized mutations that prevent nutrient restriction factors will have to replicate HCoVs in humans in a sufficient range.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people infect, the more likely it is to become fully adapted to humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to prevent its transmission in humans from quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in the human population, causing a cold in immunocompromised patients.
These viruses do not require an animal cell.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted in humans and their transmission in humans cannot be maintained.
They need to stay in and spread out in their zoonotic cavity and possibly find a chance to be transmitted to receptive human targets by one or more intermediate and growing nutrients.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those of both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
At least at the present time it is very contagious like HCoVs acquired from the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted in humans and transmitted to humans without any cosmological or intermediate animal nutrients.
Before we discuss the zoonotic origins of HCoVs, it will be of great help to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, cell, intermediate, and enhancing nutrients of HCoVs.
An animal is a slow-growing host of HCoVs if it harbours a very close ancestor with a high level of similarity to the nucleotide sequence.
The parental virus is usually well-adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
In the same way, the cell nutrients provide shelter to HCoVs continuously and for a long time.
In both situations, the nutrients become infected naturally and are the natural nutrients of HCoVs or its parent viruses.
In contrast, if HCoV enters a new intermediate host just before or around entry into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate nutrient can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an enhancing nutrient by temporarily replicating the virus and then transmitting it to humans to increase the level of human infection.
If an HCoV cannot maintain its transmission within the intermediate host, it can go into an end-transition.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate host and maintain long-term localization.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural host.
Epidemiological data showed retrospectively that the SARS indicator case had a history of contact with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence tests indicated that there was more prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG among animal traders than the general public.
In the live animal markets, masked palm civets (Pagoma larvae) and raccoon dogs were identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are largely similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after all of the seaweeds in the markets were killed.
However, it has been reported that most of the masked palm civets in the wild or fields not exposed to the live animal markets were SARS-CoV negative, which makes it clear that masked pal civets can only be as serious as the middle-growing nutrient and not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of different animals in the markets of Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that many species of small mammals may also be intermediate-enhancing hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of these appear to be the final hosts of SARS-CoV.
The follow-up discovery of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a very close bat CoV called SARS-related Rhinolophos bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese Horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive towards the genome sequence of SARS-CoV anti-immunologists and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are the nutrients of emerging human pathogens.
Many SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats but none have been isolated as living viruses other than WIV1.
Human angiotensin changer enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 extracted from samples of feces of bats was demonstrated to use bats, seaweed and human ACE2 as receptors for cellular penetration.
Interestingly, the serum of SARS patients recovering was able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV19 is the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Despite the greater similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the closest ancestral virus to SARS-CoV and bats are not the closest cell host to SARS-CoV.
Racial analysis groupes MERS-CoV into the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bats use the same nutrient receptor, Dipeptideyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4), for CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV virus penetration.
The RNA-based RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are racially close to bat beta-CoV counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest bat CoV-HKU25 have only 87% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Therefore, bats may not even be the closest cell host to MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that huddled camels, like camels of Middle East origin, are seropositarian towards MERS-CoV-specific inactivation antibodies in many African countries.
The living MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nasal swabs of huddled camels, indicating that camels are the authentic cosmos host of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels that have been experimentally infected with MERS-CoV have generally seen mild symptoms but very high virus clearance.
Notably, infected camels not only excrete viruses from the respiratory tract but also from the feces-mouth pathway, which is also the main route for the removal of viruses from bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or an unknown transmission route that includes species of animals that harbor MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide similarity with CoV RaTG13 bats isolated from bats belonging to Rhinolophos species.
Like the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is enough to determine the ancestral relationship.
That is, bats cannot be the closest host to SARS-CoV-2 unless the same type of bats are found in the future.
Presumably, the intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2 must have been one of the wild species sold and killed in the bulk market of Huanan Seafood to which several early cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a possible animal-to-human transmission event.
Based on metagenomic sequencing, several recent studies have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis Javanica) may also harbor SARS-CoV-2-related ancestral beta-CoVs.
These new pangolins share 85-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with the CoV genome SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of about 90% at the level of nucleotide sequence.
They are in two sub-genres of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the racial lineage, one of which shares a more similar Gravitational Binding Area (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very diverse, despite the more sequence similarity across the genome.
An earlier study of sick pangolins also reported finding a group of viral DNA from lung samples, which was similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted several different convergent methods and manual curation to generate a partial genome sequence with a full-length viral genome of 86.3%.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence in support of direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence diversity between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is less than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The path of gradual development of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is yet to be established.
Where the highest sequence similarity has been found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genome-wide sequence similarity.
It is a very hypothetical idea that the extreme similarity between the RBDs of pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is selectively due to intermediate convergence sequential evolution.
An alternative proposal favors a recombination between pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is widely present in beta-CoVs.
The closest zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Racial evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E bats may have originated from CoVs, while the ancestral viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It has been reported that a bat named ARCoV.2 (Applause Ridge CoV) found in three North American bats had a close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, another bat named HCoV-229E Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008 was genetically related to CoV, which was found in Ghana, although Camelid is also its suspected intermediate host.
For clarity, a summary of current information on the animal origin of known HCoVs is given in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Racial analysis has provided evidence of interspecies transmission events of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic animals around 1890, an epidemic of respiratory infections was observed.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoVs have been found to be very close to HCoV-229E.
There is an alpha-CoV between them.
Many evidence supports the transmission of the virus directly from bats to humans.
First, humans may have had contact with bats in shared ecological habitats, not alpacas.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bats are diverse and non-infectious in alpha-CoV bats, while alpaca alpha-CoV caused respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
Ultimately, the Alpaca Alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas receive HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where bats are the gene pool of alpha-CoVs HCoV-229E, alpacas and humpbacked camels can be intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just like the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to humpbacked camels and humpbacked camels to humans.
The gradual development of MERS-CoV from bats is known on its primary detection and has been further strengthened by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Long lifespans, dense settlements, close social interaction, and the extreme ability to fly are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal "virus spreaders."
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has penetrated huddled camels for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels that have changed from intermediate host to stable and natural shell host.
MERS-CoV produces very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
It has sporadic transmission accidents in humans and humans remain the last hosts of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be maintained.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if any, is different.
Notably, pangolin beta-CoVs are much more pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be the ultimate host of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, like civets, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Many possibilities of interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans are to be accepted or refuted in future studies.
First, bats can be cell hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological habitat with bats by killing or mining coal.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate-enhancing nutrients in which the SARS-CoV-2-related virus had newly entered.
Humans become infected with the virus by killing and consuming game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, may be receptive to SARS-CoV-2.
There is a need for survey of antibodies in domestic and wild animals.
Third, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 may have been recombined and adapted to a third species that had contact with both bats and pangolins.
The animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated.
In addition to a wide variety of animal nutrients, three key factors regarding virality are also important in easily overcoming CoV species barriers.
First, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoVs can be considered "high" to "moderate" with an average replacement rate of <0x7E>10-4 substitution per site per year, depending on the stage of CoV adaptation in the new host.
CoVs have proof-reading exoribonucleases, whose deletion can also lead to extreme variability and impairment or loss of life capacity.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir is thought to suppress CoV replication by this exoribonuclease and RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Yet, the mutation rate of CoVs is one million times higher than that of their hosts.
Also, mutation rates are often higher when CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a higher mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, pointing to higher levels of adaptation in humans.
Perhaps, it has already adapted to another nutrient close to humans.
With SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV that has been well adapted to huddled camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift will rapidly inactivate vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large RNA genome in the CoV puts additional plasticity on the genome change for mutation and recombination, increasing the likelihood of interspecies co-sequence development, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
It is supported by abundant unique open reading frames and coded protein functions at the 3rd end of the genome.
Third, CoVs change patterns randomly over and over again during RNA replication through a unique "copy-choice" mechanism.
In a host that acts as a mixing vessel, fibrous changes often occur during CoV RNA transcription.
Very similar full-length and subgenomic RNAs can be recombined to produce new CoVs.
Racial evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
The interaction of the virus-nurse with respect to transmission.
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the nutrient receptor is another important factor affecting intergenerational transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is seen as a common example, which also showed evidence of positive choice during interspecies transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis of the determinants between human and civet SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to be rapidly adapting to different hosts with mutations on RBD of S protein in particular.
Usually, RBD in an S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is chosen by the nutrient immune response with intensity.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acids on the S1 segment that binds with human ACE2 as well as its co-receptors for viral penetration.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of recognizing ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civets, rats and raccoons, causing intergenerational transmission of viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were isolated from human and civet viral isolates in RBD, and 4 of them are located in the receptor-binding parenthesis for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
The RBD of civet SARS-CoV consists of K479N and S487T mutations that can increase the attraction of spike protein interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid replacements may be important in the adaptation of viral in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% variation between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein indicates that the bonding similarity of its S protein with human ACE2 may be altered.
In fact, the Cryo-EM study indicates 10 to 20 times more attractiveness of this joint than the addition between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It will also be interesting to determine if any other co-creators will be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but from a different part of the S.
Several other HCoV receptors are present, such as Aminopeptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated silic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of CoVs to humans after interbreeding with their animal hosts.
The result of intergenerational transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by other nutrient dependence and restriction factors, in addition to cellular receptors.
Variation of these nutrient proteins between humans and natural cell hosts of HCoVs, such as bats, huddled camels, and rodents, can hinder interbreeding transmission.
Nutrient dependence factors have to be captured and nutrient restriction factors reversed for successful intergenerational transmission of HCoVs.
In this regard, molecular determinants are yet to be identified and described in this important area of virus-nutrient interaction.
Non-biased genome-wide testing of nutrient dependence and restriction factors of SARS-CoV-2 using the latest technology of CRISPR can be fruitful.
The Emergence of Novel HCoVs: Return to Basics
The variety of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bats act as the gene repository of CoVs.
At the same time, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also lead to the development of HCoVs and serve two important stages in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the potential to significantly alter viral symmetry.
Among SARS-CoV auxiliary proteins, ORF8 has been found to be important in adaptation in humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but they were found to code diverse ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide deletion of SARS-CoVs has been found in isolated breeds at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion breaks down ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptation mutation that promotes cell replacement.
Additionally, SARS-CoV has a potential recombination history with alpha- and gamma-CoVs genera, identifying a very large number of small recombination regions in RNA-based RNA polymerases.
Recombination locations were also identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
In the same way, it has been observed that the epidemic MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different genera, which occurred in huddled camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, with HCoVs recombining their non-structural genes with other animal CoVs.
It should also be noted that artificial selections can cause unintended changes in the viral genome, possibly due to viruses free from election pressure, such as by the nutrient immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype breed due to two-nucleotide deletion.
While intact ORF4 can be seen in bats and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the Alpaca Alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide entry, causing a frameshift.
Finally, but no less important, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also influenced by election pressures in their cell hosts.
The asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were identified when bats were infected with CoVs that indicate mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that bats were structurally and physically well adapted to CoVs.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats, effectively reduce the pathogenicity generated by CoVs.
Additionally, the inhibition of natural malignant cell activity in bats is suppressed by the regulation of the natural malignant cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low expression levels of the major tissue conformation complex Category I molecules.
In addition, higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by greater metabolic activity of bats can suppress CoV replication and affect proof readings by exoribonucleases, thus providing selection pressure for the production of highly pathogenic virus breeds when ingested into new host.
Recombination can also lead to the development of more pathogenic CoV breeds, leading to new protein or protein features for nutrient adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non- pathogenic in cell hosts such as bats and camels or cause mild symptoms.
They replicate strongly without showing a strong nutrient-resisting response.
There is a secret behind why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what causes severe cases in human infections.
Severe symptoms, mainly due to the immune response and hyperactivity of the cytokine storm, in which the greater the immune response, the more severe lung damage occurs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is isolated from the CoV replication.
The same strategy of separating the immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon reaction is particularly sharp in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon in humans should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Also, NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bats is defective.
By this logic, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same general theme from which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated.
While 95% nucleotide similarity of bat beta-CoV with SARS-CoV has been observed, bat-CoV also has 96% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals have been seen in markets harboring SARS-CoV-like viruses, the closest intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Surprisingly similar pangolin beta-CoVs have been found from SARS-CoV-2, which indicates that pangolins may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoVs may contribute to gene fragments in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Questions remain, but there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is intentionally or accidentally man-made.
CoVs have come into the limelight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has greatly changed our understanding of the zoonotic origin and standard transmission of HCoVs.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are native bats and transmission in humans is through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and civets in markets, closing the wet markets and killing civets there should have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, pangolins should be removed from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission due to the discovery of several genera of pangolin beta-CoVs quite close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and how it is transmitted remains to be clarified in future tests.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has penetrated huddled camels for decades.
These camels are an important source of traffic for the locals as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to abandon all camels to control MERS, as was done in China's wild animals markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
A comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures to prevent repeated outbreaks of MERS.
Since we have not been able to eliminate these viruses, new gene variants may emerge to create outbreaks.
Various zoonotic CoVs are circulating in the wild.
In particular, bats with fertilized capacity CoVs are very diverse.
There is a high probability that these zoonotic CoVs will develop and recombine, leading to the emergence of new CoVs that are more infectious and/or deadly in humans in the future.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some areas of China should be abandoned.
With the difficult exams of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparation and response should be planned.
In fact, many viruses have been present on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural cocoon until there is no chance of spreading.
While bats have many characteristics that aid in the spread of viruses, humans' chances of contact with them and other wild species can be minimized if people are educated about how to stay away from bats.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts which will prove useful in preventing human transmission from animals and future outbreaks.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonotic disease is for humans to stay away from the ecological habitats of natural cells of zoonotic viruses.
Many parts of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it will be interesting to see under what conditions bats and pangolins can share the same ecological habitat.
Second, if bats play a direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a real intermediate host, it should be made clear how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be receptive to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infections should be carried out.
Whether it is bats, pangolins or any other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its ancestral viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continuous testing in this area will clarify the gradual development pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals with significant effects in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the clinical criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published quick consultation guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guideline provides appropriate context for our experience and the fight against this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and experience of clinical practice; therefore, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines (seventh edition) of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, there has been an outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named the highly acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO has identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed quick consultation guidelines and which have been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and information is gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, a total of seven editions have been released with fundamental changes in some contexts in the guidelines (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
Now a comment has been made by Zhou et al. on our guideline, they have introduced a simple marking proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guidance and also provided valuable context for this pandemic worldwide.
We support their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work needs to be updated according to the latest diagnostics and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (7th trial edition) and recent studies.
According to the Seventh Edition (3 March 2020), any one item of epidemic history needs to be combined with two items of clinical manifestations in order to conduct a comprehensive analysis to confirm a suspected case, or three items of clinical manifestations need to be completed if there is no clear epidemic history:
Epidemiological history: (1) travel or residence history in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset, etc.; (2) contact history of SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases within 2 weeks of exposure to the office (with positive nucleic acid testing of the previous 14 days); (3) contact history of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or with other communities
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with reflective features of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of white blood cells showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocytes at the initial initial stage.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with one of the items of pathological or serologic evidence which are as follows: (1) the phase-of-phase replication of SARS-CoV-2 leads to acute PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-4; (2) the viral whole genome sequencing leads to higher symmetry from known novel coronaviruses; (3) the specific IgM replication for SARS-CoV-2 in serum testing.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acids in respiratory system or blood samples was added in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) versions.
The pathological identification of the blood sample was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serial evidence was added in the seventh edition.
These revisions were based on the ongoing work of researchers, who search for samples of an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for a quick diagnosis, as well as respiratory mechanisms including blood samples, which increased the availability of various samples, and support bringing specific immune-positive results to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is a lot of evidence that reminds us to be careful with unattractive symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they have classified a person with no clinical symptoms as “low risk.”
The points system needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
As a conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will come out and invite readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases," we suggest tracing and following the latest guidelines of their home countries.
Our team will also update their guidelines from time to time to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, highest single-day tally so far
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five more deaths from COVID-19 in a day.
This is the highest number of deaths reported in a single day so far.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) had reported 114 active cases and 33 people who had recovered from the disease while staying at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded so far.
In an online news briefing, Dr. Mirjadi Sabrina Flora, director of IEDCR, told that four men and one woman have died.
According to Dr Mirzadi, two patients were over 60 years of age, two were between 51 and 60 years of age and one was between 41 and 50 years of age.
He also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news centre, that the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission and was being cared for at Kuwait Friendship Hospital.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Road Transport and Bridges Minister Ubaidul Qadar said the road transport will be closed for a longer period of time than previously planned until Saturday.
The public transport shutdown began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential items like medical items, fuel and food was not prohibited.
The initial cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded in two people who returned from Italy on March 8 and the wife of one of them.
On March 19, all three of them had recovered.
The number of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide has crossed one million.
Data from Johns Hopkins University showed that on Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide exceeded one million.
The disease caused by the coronavirus is being seen as linking COVID-19 to at least 52,000 deaths.
Malawi reported its first coronavirus infection on the same day, and Zambia reported its first death from the virus.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday it was among the few countries that have so far been free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 10,51,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases reported in the twenty-four hours before 10 a.m. (0800 UTC) on April 4.
The US has recorded more than 2 lakh 44 thousand cases of coronavirus, and at least 5,900 deaths.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, more than 1,000 people have died of coronavirus in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced even more drastic measures to prevent the disease from spreading.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Thursday extended the lockdown in the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that the Russians will continue to receive salaries without going to work until April 30.
Portugal’s parliament voted in favor of extending the national emergency by 15 days; the said resolution passed by 215 votes, ten members absent and one voted against it.

Thailand plans to impose a curfew from 10 pm to 4 am.
Ohio Governor Mike Dawkins announced that the state's stay-at-home order has been extended until May 1.
Stores in Australia slash the number of toilet paper that can be purchased at once
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper that can be purchased at once in all their stores nationally to two and one package, respectively.
ALDI had also imposed a one-pack limit on Monday.
These limits were posted as messages at checkout sites and on the Facebook pages of the series.
Buyers are reported to have been making assembled purchases for a situation requiring the most isolation due to the fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Coles had imposed a ban on buying a maximum of four packs at a time on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles said in his March 8 press release that despite the four-pack ban being in place, "the stock is still running out within an hour of delivery in many stores," and described the demand as unprecedented, while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, there was a "horrific surge" in sales last week.
Costco's Canberra-based store also limited the volume to two packs last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles placed orders for more large packages to suppliers and also increased the frequency of delivery. Woolworths placed additional stock orders, while ALDI raised stocks to make available early on the pre-planned Wednesday special.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailer Association, said that while retailers try to increase stock, it becomes harder to do so due to restrictions imposed by the local council on the timing of truck delivery.
In such a situation, when the suppliers are trying to meet the demand and the number of specials has already reduced, Russell is expected to increase the production costs.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the stock was released ahead of time, some stores could not operate Wednesday specials.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, reported that stores fill up stocks every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a heavy item, so it is not stocked in large numbers, and then, when all the stock is sold, large shelves are left empty, which makes the feeling of scarcity more harsh.
According to ABC News, Russell Zimmerman said, "Coles and Woolworths have the idea [that] if there were enough stuff on the shelf, and products such as toilet paper and sanitizer could go [to buy] and be present in large quantities, the disturbance could possibly have been reduced."
Hu Gives a Crap, the manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, said last Wednesday that his stock had run out.
According to a report in News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, a company that makes cleanx toilet tissue, and Solaris Paper, a company that makes sorbents, insisted that they were working 24/7 to maintain supplies.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that in Melbourne, where less auctions are already taking place due to buyers holidaying on the long weekend of Labor Day, some property sellers are offering free toilet paper to the first bidders at the auction.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, had an eight-page insert that was given to be cut to use as toilet paper.
According to a March 3 report by ABC Australia, stores were initially unwilling to impose restrictions; in this report they said they had no plans to ban shopping.
Russell Zimmerman further said that there is also a huge demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, handwash and flour.
Similarly outside Australia, on Sunday evening, the online British supermarket Ocado also imposed a 12-roll two-pack limit on the purchase of Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s toilet paper.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS CoV-2, a global pandemic.
While the term "global pandemic" refers only to how far a disease spreads, not to how dangerous its specific cases are, the WHO discussed the need to motivate governments to take action.
"All countries can change the course of this global pandemic right now.
If countries detect the disease in response, treat patients, isolate them, trace them and unite them”, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
"We are deeply concerned about both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inactivity."
According to Dr Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is "unprecedented."
In comments published by CNN in February, he said, "No respiratory virus other than influenza has been detected in a sustained global spread."
Gabrysis also expressed a similar view when he said, "We have not seen a global pandemic caused by any coronavirus to date."
He added, “And we have never seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.”
This new status of the global pandemic, given in January after the WHO's decision to declare the outbreak an internationally worrisome public health emergency.
"One hundred things, it's going to get worse," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
The Associated Press reported that as of Thursday, there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide and that resulted in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which was declared a public health emergency internationally on 30 January 2020 and declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, nearly 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in nearly 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people have recovered.
The case fatality rate in China has been estimated at 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can also be from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
First aid is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include: hand washing, covering your mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who are suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace threat controls, and facility closures.
The pandemic has spawned serious global socio-economic chaos, prompted the postponement or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and a massive drop in supplies from panic buying by people.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are closed nationwide or locally, affecting about 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and color, and others from areas with more virus cases.
Low travel and heavy industry closures have led to reductions in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in China's Wuhan (the capital of Hubei province) reported mass cases of pneumonia for unknown reasons on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market and therefore the virus is believed to be of a zoonotic origin.
The outbreak-causing virus known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus with a close connection to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first known person with symptoms was later detected to fall ill on 1 December 2019, and the person did not have visible connections with the subsequent meat market group.
Two-thirds of the initial group of cases reported in December 2019 were found to be related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report by the South China Morning Post reported that one case was of a 55-year-old man from Hubei province on 17 November 2019, which may be the first case. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that there has been a sudden increase in Italy, Iran and South Korea with a decrease in new cases in China, with the number of new cases outside China exceeding the number of new cases within China for the first time.
Very little information of cases may have been recorded, especially in people with mild symptoms.
As of February 26, relatively few cases were reported among young people, among them people 19 years of age and younger, accounting for 2.4% of the world's cases. Patrick Wallace, the chief scientific adviser to the United Kingdom, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected before they could gain effective group immunity.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and those who have tested positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland had official policies not to test people with only mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unreported infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infected people in Italy was significantly higher than reported cases.
The initial estimate of the original fertility number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most of the people infected with COVID-19 recover.
In those who do not recover, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
By 10 April 2020, COVID-19 had caused the deaths of nearly 97,000 people.
In China, as of February 5, nearly 80% of deaths were among people over 60, and 75% of cases had pre-existing health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official count of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic, in general, refers to those who have tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who have died without testing such as at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Italy's partial statistics found that the additional death toll during the pandemic was 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged “we know that [the alleged death toll] has been quantified”, a statement that is supported by less enumerated descriptive information in the U.S. Such neumanns occur frequently in epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, Iran, South Korea and Italy each recorded more than a dozen deaths.
By March 13, deaths were reported in more than forty countries and territories on every continent except Antarctica. A number of measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The death-case ratio shows the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a certain time interval.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
This number varies by region.
In China, the death-to-case ratio is estimated to have declined from 17.3% (for those with symptoms beginning on 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms starting after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease dying, and the Infection Mortality Rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease and those who die from one.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to case recovery.
Many academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford's Center for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection death rate for an overall pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results of a statistical study analyzing the impact of the first randomized trial of COVID-19 in Germany and the test on CFR projections.
The WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak is uncertain and may vary by location.
"When left unchecked, infectious outbreaks usually stabilize and begin to decline when the available nutrients for the disease are no longer available," said Mackie's Bonnie from Penn State University.
But it is almost impossible to make any sensible guesses about when that will be."
Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that "it could end by June" if all countries follow the WHO's advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said SARS-CoV-2 was "potentially going to be circulating for a year or two."
According to an Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine becomes available (possibly 18 months or more)."
"I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus will be completely eradicated, because it circulates very easily," said William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University, and that it "can turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
The severity of withdrawal will depend on the extent of group immunity and mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include: fatigue, respiratory mucus production (cough), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemorrhagic episodes, diarrhea, or nausea. According to the WHO, about one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and blueing of the face or lips; immediate medical care is advised when these symptoms are present. More development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but the test results confirm infection, so the researchers have issued advice that close contact with those who have been confirmed should be closely monitored and tested to remove the infection.
The Chinese estimate of the asymptomatic ratio ranges from some to 44%.
The normal pathogenesis period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; this is most commonly five days. An example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who had lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and later reduced to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to be spread mainly by small droplets generated during close contact and during coughing, sneezing, or talking; when close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that droplets can go from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet) without coughing.
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted by small droplets generated while speaking that remain in the air for a longer period of time. Breath droplets can also be generated while exhaling, including when talking, although the virus is not normally airborne.
Drops can go into the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or possibly through inhalation into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as duct penetration and heart pulmonary therapy (CPR) can lead to suffocation of respiratory secretions and thus airborne spread.
It can also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there are also concerns that it may be spread by feces, its risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although communication may be possible before symptoms appear and at later stages of the disease.
For the first three days before the onset of symptoms, people have tested positive for the disease, which suggests that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
Only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed in the laboratory are present, but the asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact detection investigations.
According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person normally infects two to three other individuals. The virus survives on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus was found to be detectable, for three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for one day on cardboard, and for four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that the virus can pass from animals to humans, although British authorities recommend washing your hands after coming into contact with animals, such as after exposure to other surfaces touched by an infected person.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the related coronaviruses present in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies from household soap, which decomposes its protective covering. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be a virus of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (genus B), with two bat-derived breeds.
This is equivalent to 96% of other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the entire genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in parts of genome sequences between viruses from pangolins and viruses from humans.
So far in the entire genome comparison, the normal genetic content between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a maximum of 92%, which is insufficient for pangolins to form intermediate nutrients.
The infection can be temporarily detected by the virus based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately from the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT images of the infected secretion.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although many of its image characteristics are less specific as it is similar to other pneumonias and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used as a primary test to check for or diagnose COVID-19."
The WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first version of which was released on January 17.
This test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to days.
In general this test is performed on the nasopharynx, but a sore throat can also be used. Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been proven sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the US has only been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Characteristic image characteristics on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of symptomatic people include asymmetric peripheral ground glass ambiguities and absent pleural secretions.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.
Due to similarities with other infections such as adenovirus, there is limited specificity of imaging in identifying COVID-19, without confirmation by PCR.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that although imaging is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its idea as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial knowledge-based curved neural networks have been developed to detect the imaging characteristics of viruses with both radiographs and CT.
To prevent the transmission of the disease, strategies include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a tissue and putting that tissue directly into the trash can.
Those who may already have an infection are advised to wear a surgical mask in public places.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have banned or advised against all non-essential travel to and from countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where and how they got infected. Care providers who care for an infected person are recommended to take standard precautions, contact precautions, and protect the eyes. Contact tracing is an important way for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, for which Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement for limitations on such surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log proximity to one user's other cellphones.
Users then receive a message if they are in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about ways to prevent infection are spreading; for example, rubbing the nose and garnishing with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine available, although many organizations are working to develop a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the transmission of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands appear dirty; before eating; and after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside of the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubbles.
Additionally, the CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with several solutions, including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidone-iodine (within a minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface).
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chromoxidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed at an office or facility such as day care, all areas such as offices, toilets, public spaces, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by sick individuals should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with an elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing and then promptly dispose of any tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may be infected, as wearing a mask may limit the amount of inhaled droplets and the distance to be covered when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “wearing masks may reduce people’s tendency to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene.” Masks have also been recommended to be used by people who are caring for someone with the disease.
The WHO has recommended wearing a mask by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for a person with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by ordinary individuals.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made of fabric. China has recommended the use of disposable medical masks by normal healthy people, especially when they come in close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or when staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out in public without wearing masks or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam urged everyone to wear a face mask when going to public areas for the safety of themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for all people entering the grocery store to wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear a face mask when going to the public area.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks per day since mid-March, has made it mandatory for passengers to wear face masks on trains and intercity buses on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask while going out, while it has also been recommended to make homemade face masks for those who cannot afford a face mask.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control functions, which aim to slow the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Its methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
Individuals can implement ways to create social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using greetings without contact, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum population reduction recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations ranged from 250 people (if there were no known COVID-19 transmissions in an area) to 50 people, and later up to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and individuals with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and weakened immune systems aimed to make contact with the elderly more at risk of serious disease and complications so that they can be socially distanced and that they are advised by the CDC to "stay at home as much as possible" in areas with community outbreaks. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies
The use of the term “social distancing” resulted in the implication that, instead of encouraging people to stay in touch with others through alternative means, complete social isolation should be adopted. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines to be used during the pandemic.
These include recommendations to have sex only with a person who lives with you, who does not have symptoms of the virus or the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected to be infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in the affected areas.
The most stringent self-quarantine instructions have been issued in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have come in contact with someone infected with COVID-19 and who have recently been in a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
Containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is aimed at detecting infected people as well as other measures to control the infection and implement vaccination to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is not possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts go into a state of mitigation: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its effects on the health system and society.
The combination of both containment and mitigation measures can be carried out at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures, so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the original reproduction number to 1. Part of managing infectious disease outbreaks is to try to reduce the peak of the pandemic, known as reducing the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services crashing and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage outbreaks include individual preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, face mask wearing and self-quarantine; strict community measures intended to create physical distancing such as closing schools and canceling mass gathering programs; stricter measures were taken to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions, as well as stricter community participation when the cleaning of surfaces such as environmental measures were applied to the purpose of the outbreak.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea began mass testing and localized quarantine, and issued warnings on the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial assistance for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed major fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and punished the hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the U.S. show that there are big challenges in mitigation (slowing the spread of the epidemic but not stopping) and suppression (reverting the development of the epidemic).
Optimum mitigation policies can reduce the demand for extreme health care by two-thirds and death by half, but even then hundreds of people die and health systems collapse.
Suppression can be prioritized, but it needs to be maintained until the virus is spreading to the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it is the first), otherwise transmission from the dysfunction in the measures returns faster.
The long-term intervention for the suppression of the pandemic generates social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking cold-cold-cold-cold medicines without prescription, drinking fluids, and relaxing can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be needed.
The results can be worse with the use of steroids.
Many compounds that are already approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being tested for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
According to the WHO, some "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Capacity building and optimizing health care for the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.
The ECDC and WHO’s European Regional Office have issued guidelines for the transfer of resources to hospitals and primary health care services at several levels, including: focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, canceling selective procedures whenever possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 infected patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by personnel training and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are many opinions about where the first case (the so-called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus was identified on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly associated with the bulk market of Hunan seafood, in which live animals were also sold, and one opinion is that the virus came from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, it is of zoonotic origin. The pneumonia group with unknown cause was observed on December 26 and which was treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital in Xi'an, which was treated on December 27.
On December 30, a group of physicians at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues about the "SARS-like coronavirus."
Police warned eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, I Fan, was reprimanded by his superiors.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the WHO.
A considerable number of cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan, resulting in an investigation launched in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled almost every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces due to movement and Wuhan being the transportation hub and major rail exchange due to the Chinese New Year.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data shows that by 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had already developed symptoms. As of 26 March, the U.S. has overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 people have recovered.
Nearly 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have banned free movement and established border controls.
National responses include quarantine measures such as quarantine (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter orders in their place, or lockdowns) and curfews. As of April 2, about 300 million people in the U.S. or about 90% of the population is in some form of lockdown, more than 50 million people in the Philippines are in lockdown, about 59 million people in South Africa are in lockdown, and 1.3 billion people in India are in lockdown.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of lockdown, which rose to 2.6 billion people two days later - nearly a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been detected in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; an unconfirmed report shows that the first case occurred on 17 November.
Doctor Zhang Jixian saw a group of cases of pneumonia with unknown causes on December 26, after which his hospital informed the Wuhan Jiangnan CDC on December 27.
Early genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was notified on the same day.
After the arrival of these information, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police to "spread rumors" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a raging campaign to stop the spread of the virus, which was called a "people's war" by Xi Jinping, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.
Described as "the largest quarantine in human history," a siege zone was announced in Wuhan on January 23 to prevent movement, which was extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of 57 million people.
Private vehicles were banned in the city.
Chinese New Year (25 January) celebrations were canceled at many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hoshenson Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later another hospital, the Leishenson Hospital, was built to handle additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government established additional measures to prevent the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health announcements for travelers and extending the spring festival holiday.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau established a number of measures, especially with regard to schools and universities.
Measures to work remotely were established in many Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were imposed in and out of Hubei.
Public transport was modified, and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
The movement of the public was controlled in many cities, and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of external restrictions. After the outbreak reached its global stage in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from “coming” to other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. On March 23, only one case was reported domestically in the last five days in mainland China, in this example through a passenger returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang informed that the spread of domestically transmitted cases has been basically stopped and the outbreak in China has been controlled.
Travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, in addition to Wuhan, on the same day two months after the lockdown was imposed. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March, with no specific details on when this policy will end.
Those who want to enter China will have to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30 and provided economic stimulus packages for businesses. The State Council, on April 4 at 10:00 a.m., declared a day of mourning by beginning with a three-minute national silence, which was at the time of the Qingming festival, although the central government asked families to pay tribute online while following physical distancing to avoid the new COVID-19 outbreak.
The outbreak of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed on 20 January 2020.
The nation's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely related to the crowd gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji devotees coming to Daegu from Wuhan were suspected of the origin of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, 1,261 or about 13% of the church’s 9,336 followers reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.
On February 28, Korea reported more than 2,000 confirmed cases, which rose to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The airline programs were also affected and were therefore changed. The program that South Korea offered was considered to be the largest and best organized program in the world to check the population for the virus and isolate any infected people, as well as detect and quarantine those who came in contact with them.
The screening methods included mandatory self-information of symptoms by new international arrivals via mobile applications, accelerated testing for the virus with results available the next day, and increasing testing capacity to test 20,000 people per day.
South Korea’s program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantining entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for Moon's impeachment, claiming the government's mismanagement of the outbreak, or praised his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest number of one-day cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was informed that from April 1, all new foreign arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.
Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Qom on February 19, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
The initial measures announced by the government included closing concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and Friday prayers, and closing universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran allocated five trillion riyals to deal with the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak and that only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic continued between cities before the Persian New Year Navroz.
As of 16 March 2020, Shia shrines in Qom were open to pilgrims. During February, Iran became the epicentre of virus transmission after China.
Amid claims of concealing the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries found their cases linked to Iran as of February 28, indicating that by that day the extent of the outbreak could be more severe than the 388 cases recorded by the Iranian government.
The Iranian parliament was shut down when 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful protests and to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
It said closed institutions such as quarantine centres are at greater risk of spreading the virus, which also lacks adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
As of March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease.
As of March 23, Iran was reporting 50 new cases every hour and a new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there could be five times more cases than what is being reported in Iran.
It has also been suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran may have affected the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded that economic sanctions be eased for countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
Cases began to rise rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
Starting from 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February, an unrelated group of COVID-19 cases was detected. On 22 February, the council of ministers announced a new judicial-law to prevent the outbreak, which quarantined more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In areas with outbreaks, entry and exit will not be provided.
The order to postpone work activities and sports programs in those areas has already been issued. “On 4 March the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country, as there were 100 deaths in Italy.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held without witnesses until April, but on 9 March, all sports were completely postponed for at least a month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered to stop almost all business activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations about the protocol of sorting, severe patients that can be employed.
On March 19, Italy surpassed China in terms of the highest coronavirus-related death toll in the world after reporting 3,405 deaths from the pandemic.
On March 22, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft to Italy with medical equipment.
As of April 5, with the majority of cases occurring in the Lombardy region, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recoveries.
A CNN report indicated that a combination of Italy's older population and the inability to test people who had the virus by that time may have contributed to higher mortality.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus initially emerged as the most relaxed of the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for its perceived lack of speed and intensity in responding to concerns faced by the public. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised to stop all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting people work from home where possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that all entertainment establishments such as pubs and gyms should be closed as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers’ wages to the limit of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced measures for strict social distancing, including limiting the gathering of more than two people and limiting travel and outdoor activity.
Unlike the previous measures, these restrictions were implemented by the police through imposition of fines and dispersal of crowds.
Most businesses were ordered to close, except those deemed "essential," which include supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware shops, petrol stations and garages.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control - the U.S. government's premier public health institution - announced that they have developed their test kit.
Despite doing so, the U.S. made a slow start to the trial, making it difficult to understand the actual extent of the outbreak at the time.
The testing was interrupted by faulty test kits produced by the federal government in February, lack of federal government approval for non-government test kits (by academics, companies and hospitals) by the end of February, and restrictive criteria (which required a physician's order) to qualify for a test of people by the beginning of March.
As of February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the US.
By March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On March 22, The Associated Press reported: “Many people who have symptoms and have a physician’s order waited for hours or days for a trial.” Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency after the first death was reported in Washington state on February 29 in the US, an action that was soon followed by other states.

On March 25, the governor said social distancing was working, as the estimate of doubling the case slowed from 2.0 days to 4.7 days.
As of 28 March, New York City had 32,308 confirmed cases, and 672 people had died from the virus. On 26 March, the U.S. reported more confirmed coronavirus infections than any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of 8 April, the U.S. has confirmed 400,335 cases, and 12,841 deaths.

Belgium recalled 100,000 unused masks, believed to have come from China, but actually came from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese assistance has been well received in Latin America and parts of Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency aid campaigns for developing countries.
The WHO has appreciated the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containing the pandemic.
The WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of privacy that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government "provided regular updates to avoid fear before the Lunar New Year holidays."
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Gallia commented that while "certainly the WHO did not make the first recommendation during the outbreak of the 2009 epidemic" of the epidemic, "the increase in the number of other cases after the WHO confirmed" was "a very important sign of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated" and called it "unprecedented in the public health history" outside of China, on 30 January.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said PHEIC was "at risk of global spread, especially in low and middle-income countries without strong health systems."
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros said that “there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement.”
On February 5, the WHO appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the need to help countries that do not have "systems set up to detect people infected with the virus, even though it was about to emerge."
Tedros further announced in statements, "We are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more later". On February 11, WHO established COVID-19 as the name of the disease at a press conference.
On the same day, Tedros said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide "the power of the entire UN system in response."
The result was activated a crisis management team of the United Nations, which coordinated the entire UN response, which according to the WHO would enable them to “focus on the health response, while other agencies could use their expertise in enduring the broader social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak.”
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO with China, to assist in domestic management of the epidemic, and to make it more likely that by hosting meetings with workshops and major national-level institutions, it should remain in the "pandemic of the epidemic" as soon as it is announced that the epidemic is over, WHO said that it was "active in the field to assess the impact of response activities at provincial and county levels, including urban and rural arrangements," to WHO, international and experts in China.
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, the WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO authorities said that the threat of coronavirus at the global level would be assessed from “high” to “very high”, which is the highest level of vigilance and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s health emergency program, warned in a statement that “this is a reality check for every government on earth: it’s time to wake up.”
The virus may be coming its way and you need to be prepared," he said, urging that the right response measures can help the world avoid "at its worst."
Ryan went on to say that current statistics have not convinced public health authorities to declare a global pandemic, adding that such a declaration would mean "we are essentially acknowledging that every human on Earth will come in contact with that virus."
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said the WHO was "deeply concerned by both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction". The WHO has faced major criticism as inadequate management of the pandemic, including delays in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a pandemic.
The backlash included a petition for the resignation of WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the need to respect the rights of every person during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group said everyone is entitled to life-saving interventions and the responsibility lies with the government.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
Experts stressed that everyone has the right to health, including people with disabilities, minority groups, older people, internally displaced people, homeless, people living in extreme poverty, people in detention, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups requiring government assistance.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information as well as perspectives and advice on policy responses in countries around the world.
From policies to strengthening health systems and from the world economy to addressing the effects of travel restrictions and restrictions, the digital hub includes a country policy tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government's handling of the pandemic that began in the Chinese province of Hubei has drawn criticism from the US, UK Minister for Cabinet Office Michael Gove, and Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
Many provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed to deal with quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political institution's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe the move was intended to protect Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, declined a prior acknowledgement of the coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, which was in favour of conspiracies about COVID-19 originating from the US or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or the "Wuhan virus", saying that China's "control system has turned a virus into a global pandemic now", which some critics have regarded as "a distraction from racism and the failure of his administration to prevent disease."
The Daily Beast obtained a U.S. government wiretap that underscores the communication frontage at the National Security Council with clear origins, citing the strategy as saying "everything is about China."
We are being asked to try to send this message in any way, including press conferences and television appearances. “Outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China’s attempt to send aid to virus-hit countries is part of propaganda to increase global influence.
The EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that it has “a geopolitical component that includes the struggle for influence through reshuffle and ‘politics of generosity’.”
Borrell also said that “China is aggressively pushing the message that unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China has also called on the US to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with aid reportedly being sent to the latter two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of converting intended aid to other nations for their own country.
And there have been mask-related disputes between Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and other countries, such as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of ventilators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU's lack of solidarity with coronavirus-hit Italy.
Italy's ambassador to the EU Maurizio Massari said that "only China reacted bilaterally."
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to the Russian army.
Italy's La Stampa newspaper cited an unnamed "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use to Italy."
The source accused Russia of being "geo-political and diplomatic" flattery.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia sent medical aid to the United States from a cargo plane.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “while offering assistance to American allies [Putin] believes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase production, they will also be able to repay if necessary.”
The largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, NATO "Defender 2020" military exercises will be held at a low level.
Secretary-General for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: “In the current public-health crisis, it is endangering not only the lives of soldiers from the U.S. and many European countries but also the residents of the participating countries where they are working.” The Iranian government has been greatly affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of parliament infected as well as fifteen other current or former political people.
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders seeking help on March 14, 2020, stating that his country, as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran, is struggling to fight the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets. The outbreak has led the U.S. to pursue universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high-level financing for public health in other countries as well.
Political analysts speculated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan's "unexplained and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at sites designated by the government.
South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment, claiming the government’s mismanagement of the outbreak, or praised her response. The pandemic has prompted countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could help governments strengthen their grip on power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n to rule indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those who were found to be dealing with the virus and the crisis and spreading false information about the government.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for a number of instances of supply shortages, stemming from the use of equipment to fight the outbreak globally, fear-induced shopping, and disruption to factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about shortages of medicines and medical devices due to rising consumer demand and supplier disruptions.
Fear-induced shopping conditions were also observed in many areas, leading to a shortage of essential grocery items like food, toilet paper, and bottled water from the shelves, leading to a shortage of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has been warned about delays in the transportation of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
Due to this demand, the normal price has increased by up to twenty times and at the same time there has been a delay in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This has led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, which the WHO has warned would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Daigu shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity led to a shortage of infant formula in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases and high demand for food products in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, both regions are surviving an acute food shortage.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the hoarding and illegal trade of important products have been successful, avoiding the acute shortage of food that was anticipated in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy has not seen a major reduction in its significant agricultural production, but prices may rise, according to industry representatives.
The empty food shelves in the city of Wuhan were only temporarily seen, while Chinese government officials released stockpiles of pork-meat to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws in Italy make it mandatory for food producers to have reserves for such emergencies.
The global economy in China has suffered losses: According to a media report on March 16, the government's measures to prevent the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%, causing a deep blow to the economy in China in the first two months of 2020.
As mainland China is a major economy and manufacturing hub, the virus outbreak has been deemed a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demiris of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture emerges on the possible outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the pandemic on global growth may be greater than the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at Washington University in St. Louis put the impact of $300<0x2B> billion on the world supply chain that could last for two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reportedly "stuck" after a steep fall in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
Due to rising concerns about the coronavirus outbreak on February 27, various U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, reported the sharpest decline since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three indices fell more than 10% that week.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign debt ceiling, but maintained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again, based on coronavirus fears, with the biggest drop occurring on March 16.
Many people believe that there is a possibility of an economic slowdown.
Economist Mohammed Al-Arian praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.
Central banks are reacting more quickly than the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst affected areas due to travel restrictions, the closure of public places, including travel attractions, the advice of governments to stop any travel around the world.
As a result, a number of airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, have cancelled flights due to low demand, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
Its impact on the cruise line industry was the most ever seen.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The timing of this pandemic also coincides with the time of Chunyun, the major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
A large number of events, including annual New Year's celebrations, have been canceled by national and regional governments, with private companies independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
A number of Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed in Beijing to prevent mass gatherings, including Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities have extended New Year's holiday until February 10, with most workplaces instructed not to reopen until that date.
These sectors represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response levels to the highest level and declared an emergency, shutting down schools until March and canceling its New Year’s celebrations. The retail sector has been affected globally, with store hours reduced or temporarily closed.
Retailer visits to Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% decline.
The number of people walking to shopping centers in March dropped by 33-43% compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world took additional measures, such as increasing sanitation, setting up thermal scanners to check shoppers’ temperatures, and canceling ceremonies. According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, pandemic-induced recessions could leave 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America who would not have been in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million rural migrant workers are stuck at home in inland provinces or stranded in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cut 47 million jobs in the U.S. and lead to a 32% drop in unemployment rate as estimated by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The lockdown in India has left several million migrant workers unemployed (those paid through daily wages). A survey by Angus Reed Institute found that 44% of Canadian households experienced some kind of unemployment after Labor Lost in 2020 in the mid-March.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers had applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers had applied for a universal loan scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers to government-funded short-term working plans called Kurzarbet.
The German short-term work compensation plan has been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been heavily affected by the pandemic, which has affected both individuals employed and working independently, as well as affecting the operations of organizations globally.
Organizations in the arts and culture sector strive to maintain their (usually publicly funded) mission to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, to maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists where possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions around the world were closed indefinitely, with their exhibitions, ceremonies and exhibitions cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapidly growing consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social gatherings, such as concerts and technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruption. The Vatican announced that Holy Week observations in Rome, which take place during the last week of Lent’s Christian mourning session, have been canceled.
Many bishops-areas have recommended elderly Christians stay at home instead of attending mass on Sunday; some churches have provided church services via radio, online live streaming or television, while others are offering drive-in worship.
With the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome closing its churches and prayer halls and evacuating Christian pilgrims from St. Peter's Square, other religious bodies have also cancelled services in churches, mosques, Jewish synagogues, temples and gurdwaras and limited public gatherings.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and later closed the pilgrimages, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as citizens to holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the sports calendar worldwide since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been canceled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not beyond the summer of 2021". The casino and other gaming venues worldwide have been closed and live poker tournaments have been postponed or cancelled.
This has caused many gamblers to adopt the online method, with many online gambling sites reporting significant increases in new sign-up rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling concerts.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway ones, also suspended all performances.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue and share work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming of concerts or creating web-based "functions" to promote artists' performances, distribution, and their work.
Online, many coronavirus-themed internet memes have spread as humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, growing prejudice against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and those with hotspots in Europe, the US and other countries, has been noted for xenophobia and racism.
Many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, have seen incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility.
Since February, reports (when most of the cases were still limited to China) have documented racist sentiments of Chinese people being able to get the virus or receiving justifiable punishments in various groups around the world.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Online and offline help is available for Chinese people and for people in virus-affected areas.
After the progress of the outbreak in new hotspot countries, people in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, may also experience suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to prevent Chinese people from entering their countries in an effort to prevent the disease.
The hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan has been trending on Twitter.
Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported increasing levels of racist abuse as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus," which was perceived by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign dissidents from Wuhan to Novi Sanjhari.
Students from northeast India, which borders China, who study in major Indian cities, have reportedly experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, said that the Chinese have destroyed nature and "that is why God has avenged them."
Later, the Chinese consulate in Kolkata condemned the remark, calling it “misleading”. In China, xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents were fueled by the pandemic, with foreigners described as being targeted for “foreign waste” and “settlement”.
Many newspapers with paywalls removed them for part or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers provided scientific papers related to the outbreak with open access.
Some scientists chose to quickly share their results on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include methods for detecting the presence of the virus and for detecting antibodies produced as a response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm recent or active infections.
Immunologists can be used for both diagnosis and surveillance of people.
Immunization tests show how many people have had the disease, including people whose symptoms were too mild to indicate or who were asymptomatic.
The results of this investigation can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in people.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus in people as of March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and there are considerable disparities on how many have been tested in different countries.
The reported cases of this inequality are also likely to significantly affect mortality, which is likely to be significantly higher estimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), testing can be done on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs or mucus samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test done with throat swabs is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
The virus may later disappear from the throat, while it continues to grow in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, alternatively the sample material can then be taken from the airways by the suction catheter inside or the inhaled material (sputum) can be used.
One of the initial PCR tests using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was developed in January 2020 in Charit<0xC3><0xA9>, Berlin, and became the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed the test kit by 23 January 2020. Koganbiotech, a South Korean company, developed a clinical category, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It discovers the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene specifically distributed in SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval of the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing kit from the National Medical Products Administration of China (Coronas-Covid) for the 2019 COVID-19 pandemic.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of the test kit yielded inconclusive results due to faulty reagents, and caused problems in testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this led to an average of less than 100 samples a day of samples successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The tests using the two components were not considered reliable till 28th February 2020 and state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing till then.
Testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authority. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available across the country as of 9 March 2020.
No volume limitations were announced; the aggregation and processing of samples should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020 this investigation was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. On 12 March 2020 Mayo Clinic reported developing investigations to detect the infection of COVID-19. On 13 March 2020 Roche Diagnostics received approval from the FDA for a high-volume investigation that can be done within 3.5 hours, resulting in approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period from one machine.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the Emergency Use Authority (EUA) to Abbot Laboratories for testing on Abbot's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Holographic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Sheffield similarly received the EUA from the FDA for an investigation that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved an investigation that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of variable temperature cycles, this method can give positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott wants to increase manufacturing to 50,000 tests per day. A testing kit is being developed in Taiwan that uses monoclonal antibodies that bind specifically to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus, with the hope that this rapid influenza test can deliver results in as little as 20 minutes.
A March 2020 literature review concluded that “the chest radiograph has a low clinical significance in the early stages, while CT [computerized tomography] findings may be available even before the onset of symptoms.”
Typical features of CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, the effect of subpleural, crazy paving and consolidation develops.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, the source point of the current pandemic, has suggested that with many of the portrayal characteristics of CT being similar to other pneumonia and disease processes, it is noticeably more sensitive than PCR, despite being less specific.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “CT should not be used as a screening or first-line screening for the diagnosis of COVID-19”. As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for primary screening.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to determine immunity in individuals starting at or around 7 days after the onset of symptoms and to detect infection for people to monitor. Testing can be done in Central Laboratories (CLT) or by Point-of-Care Testing (PoCT).
Automated systems with high flow capacity in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is usually used for CLT, although a series of samples may be used to look for an immune response.
A single sample of blood for PoCT is usually obtained from the skin puncture.
Withdrawal steps are not required prior to testing other than PCR methods. On 26 March 2020, the FDA designated 29 units that provided information to the agency when needed and are thus now able to distribute their immune tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authorization. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received Europe’s approval for its testing kits that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
It has the ability to test hundreds of samples within a few hours and is therefore much faster than the traditional PCR test of viral RNA.
Immunizations can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the UK found that none of the immune testing kits they purchased were good enough for use.
Hong Kong planned in which suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will provide the patient with a tube of the sample", they will spit in it and return and get the results of the investigation in no time. The British NHS announced that they are starting a plan to test the suspect cases at home, taking the patient's risk of infecting others with COVID-19 while being careful, which eliminates the patient's risk of contracting the virus if he goes to the hospital or disinfects the used ambulance.
Drive-through testing centers have helped South Korea conduct the fastest, most comprehensive tests from any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statuary Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that they had the capacity to conduct nearly 12,000 tests per day in an ambulatory setting and performed 10,700 tests last week.
When an order for a check-up is placed by the physician, the cost is borne by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
By March 19, drive-through checks were offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
The first laboratory survey observed that as of week 12/2020, week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested positive for COVID-19 and 33,491 (6.9%) of the samples tested were positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital found combinations of samples and if combined sample positivized
With BGI founder Wang Jian overseeing the construction and taking 5 days, the model observed that if it had not started the ability to check, the number of cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost of dealing with quarantine would have doubled.
Wuhan Laboratory's Huo-Yen laboratories have followed immediately in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities throughout China.
As on 4th March 2020, the total daily flow capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Multiplexed open source frameworks have been released by Origami Essay which can test up to a maximum of 1122 COVID-19 patients samples using 93 tests. These balanced frameworks can be run in small labs without the need for robotic liquid handlers.
Prior to March, deficiencies and insufficient quantities of reagents caused problems in large-scale testing in the EU, UK and US.
This prompted some authors to explore sampling protocols that include heating the samples at 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for up to 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now ramping up the level of testing per capita for the coronavirus of its population to a much higher level than any other country.
This was due to a combination of drive-through testing and the purchase of population-scale mass-throughput laboratories from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency testing laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory in the world to operate on such a large scale outside China.
Various testing methods targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted and sent Germany's method for the manufacture of kits for developing low-income countries without resources themselves.
Germany's law was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the U.S. There were problems over the reliability of the test kits between China and the United States at the start of the outbreak and these countries and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to meet the demands and recommendations of the investigation by health experts.
In contrast, experts point out that the widespread availability of testing in South Korea helped slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The testing capability, especially in private sector laboratories, was developed by the South Korean government over the course of several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization said that ramping up testing programs is the best way to slow the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has led to thousands of pending tests in private U.S. laboratories and the supply of phages and chemical reagents being strained.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy issues in its test kits.
In the United States, there was a "lack" of testing kits developed by the CDC; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that were preventing private testing. Spain purchased testing kits from Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioenergy Biotechnology Co. Ltd., but found that the results were not accurate.
The firm explained that the incorrect results may be due to the failure to collect samples or to use the kits correctly.
Spain’s ministry said it would remove the faulty test kits and replace them with a second test kit made available by Shenzhen BioEge. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China yielded incorrect results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China, which were not found to be accurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested that these should be put into the Danube. Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits purchased from China by Turkey had a "high error rate" and that they "did not use them". The UK, which purchased 3.5 million test kits from China in early April 2020, announced that they were not usable.
Quarantine of those who have tested positive and contact tracing of those who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 have yielded positive results.
Instead of dying from the first COVID-19 in Italy, researchers working in Italy's V<0xC3><0xB2> town double-checked the entire population of about 3,400 people over a span of about ten days.
Nearly half of those with positive results had no symptoms, and all those with detected cases were quarantined.
The travel ban on commuting to and from the place completely eliminated new infections.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore is much slower than other developed countries in terms of contact tracing, internal travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but without forceful restrictions such as closing restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home from March 28, but reopened on March 23 after a school holiday.
Many other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also managed the pandemic by aggressively tracing contacts, making internal travel restrictions, checking and quarantining, but by less aggressive lockdowns.
The statistical study showed that countries that had more tests than the number of deaths had a much lower case fatality rate, possibly because these countries are only more capable of detecting mild or asymptomatic people.
The WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to test and whose national laboratories have limited experience on COVID-19 send their first five positive and the first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the "% of positives in tests" column is influenced by the country's test policy.
On the other hand, in a country where only hospitalized people are tested, the percentage of positive tests will be higher than in a country where all citizens are tested, regardless of whether they show symptoms or not.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning your hands for the purpose of removing mud, oil, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at any "urgent moments" during a day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the faeces-mouthed route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
Five important moments during the day where washing hands with soap are important are: before and after defecation, after cleaning or changing the baby’s buttocks, before feeding the baby, before and after preparing food or consuming raw meat, fish or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing at the following times:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child using the toilet.
After sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animal, animal feed, or animal waste.
Therapeutic hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to therapeutic procedures.
Hand washing before providing medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main therapeutic purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands of those pathogens (bacterium, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or diseases.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important verb for ordinary people.
Hand washing has a number of health benefits, including: reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and to reduce neonatal mortality in cases of childbirth at home.
A 2013 study showed that well-handwashing exercises in children under the age of five may slightly improve their length.
In developing countries, simple behavioral changes, such as starting to wash hands with soap, can reduce infant mortality related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases.
This simple task can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.
Measures that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea cases by about a third, and this is similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
A 48% reduction in diarrhea cases can be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARI) in homes, schools and communities around the world as a self-induced behavior.
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under the age of five, with an estimated 18 million children dying each year.
Around 35 lakh children die every year due to diarrhoea and pneumonia.
According to UNICEF, making handwashing with soap a strong habit before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or therapeutic measure, which can reduce the number of deaths from diarrhea by about half and the number of deaths from acute respiratory infections by one-fourth.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other sanitation measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo that spreads through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause damage to the skin due to dryness of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy, flaky skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health workers.
Too often hand washing is also seen as a symptom of psychotic-obsessive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce transmission from the feces-mouth route of the disease: after using the toilet (urine immersion, feces-abandonment), after cleaning the baby's buttocks (after changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before preparing and consuming food or raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other occasions when appropriate hand washing techniques should be practiced to prevent the transmission of the disease are: before and after the treatment of a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or spraying your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that on average 38.7% of households adopted the practice of hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that children in Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of hand washing at a fixed rate of 97 percent; children in the U.S. with 77 percent had the lowest rate of handwashing at a given day; and children in China with 23 percent had the lowest rate of handwashing at a given time. Many of behaviours now available to increase the practice of hand washing with soap at critical times.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of mass action to promote children's health and education.
The core of this national programme includes daily cleaning of teeth from fluoride as well as daily washing of hands with soap and anti-worm treatment twice a year.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
It can be better to remove microorganisms from the skin by mixing soap or detergent in water.
The main action of soap and detergent is to reduce the obstacles in the solution, and increase the solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin purifier because fats and proteins, which are organic soil components, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, adequate flow of water is achieved in cleaning.
Due to its repeated use, solid soap may contain bacteria left over from previous uses.
Some studies looking at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that transfer is unlikely due to bacteria being washed away with foam.
Nevertheless, according to the CDC, "remedy soaps with a liquid soap drop feature on the palms are better without touching the hands."
Antibacterial soaps have been promoted with emphasis on public health awareness.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants produces antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
Antibacterial soaps, however, contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a comprehensive list of resistant breeds of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibacterial soaps do not produce antibiotic-resistant breeds, they may not be as effective as they are promoted to be effective.
In addition to moisturizing and skin-protecting agents, refined formulations contain phytosanitary acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as the pH regulator, antimicrobialally active benzoic acid and other skin adaptive agents (aloevera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts) can be widely used. University of Oregon School of Public
Comfortable hot water for hand washing is not warm enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow very fast at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0> C).
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water to remove soil and bactericidal natural oils.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing the amount of microorganisms on the hands.
A hand sanitiser or hand disinfector is a water-based hand hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, worn-out alcohol water-free hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, disinfectant hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most of these isopropyls are based on alcohol or ethanol, which are formulated with carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) in a gel such as a thickening agent, or glycerin in a liquid or foam, for ease of use and to reduce the effect of alcohol drying.
Antimicrobial activity is further enhanced by the addition of a thin hydrogen-peroxide. Hand sanitizers with 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient disinfectants.
Alcohol rub sanitisers kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinoviruses, vaccines, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitisers that contain 70% alcohol destroy 99.97% of bacteria after 30 seconds of applying (similar to a 3.5 log reduction, 35 decibels reduction) and destroy 99.99% to 99.99% of bacteria after 1 minute of applying (4 to 5 log reduction). Hand sanitizers are the most effective against bacteria and some are more effective against viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) types of viruses that are the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Sufficient hand disinfectants or alcohol rubs should be used to wet or cover both hands as a whole.
The front and back parts of both hands and in the middle and the toes of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel dry.
Fingertips should also be washed thoroughly by rubbing them in both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand sanitizer rubs, especially when hands appear dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and quick-drying activation towards microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless lubricants and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by mixing glycerin and/or other lubricants into the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing lubricants significantly reduced skin irritation and dryness compared to soaps or antimicrobial aphrodisiacs.
Rarely allergic to additives present in alcohol or alcohol hand rubs are contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity.
The low tendency to induce disturbing contact dermatitis became an attraction compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, unwatered agents do not clean organic substances by hands, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of pathogens, as pathogens still remain on the hands.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is heavily dependent on materials and formulations, and historically their performance has been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to reduce efficacy after repeated use due to potentially progressive adverse skin reactions, benzalkonium chloride has been shown to have sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activity after applying formulations that use benzalkonium chloride.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ash or soil instead.
The ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it can increase rather than reduce the spread of the disease.
Similar to soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because it forms an alkaline solution when exposed to water.
The WHO has recommended ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the prevention of disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because basins with stagnant water can be contaminated, although the temperature of the water does not matter.
Make foam by rubbing the appropriate amount of soap on the hands, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap instead of water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing causes friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and more germs are released by rubbing for a longer period of time.
Wash well under running water.
Washing hands in the basin can be contaminated again.
Dry with a clean towel or let dry in the air.
Wet and damp hands are more easily recontaminated. The most exempt areas are the area between the thumb, wrist, fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and chipped nail polish can shelter microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to protect the hands from drying out; dry skin can cause damage to the skin which can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
In developing countries where tap water and/or soap are not available, various low-cost options can be created to facilitate hand washing, for example by pouring water from a hanging pot or gourd with suitable holes and/or using ash. In situations with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-conservation solutions are available.
Tippy-tap is a simple technique in which jugs hung by rope, and a leg-operated lever, are used to pour a small amount of water on the palms and soles of the hands.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some controversy over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
Research conducted in large quantities suggests that paper towels provide more cleanliness than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, sponsored by the paper towel industry The European Tissue Symposium, which aimed to compare the level of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and state-of-the-art jet-air hand dryers.
On average, the total number of bacteria after hand washing and drying with a hot air dryer increased by 194% on the mattresses of the fingers and 254% on the palms.
Drying with a jet-air dryer increased the total number of bacteria on average 42% on the mattresses of the fingers and 15% on the palms.
After hand washing and drying with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on average decreased by 76% on the mattresses of the fingers and by 77% on the palms. The scientists also carried out tests to establish whether each type of drying method had the potential for cross-contamination of other toilet users and the toilet environment.
The jet-air dryer, which extracts air from the unit at an estimated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow microbes out of the hands and unit and possibly contaminate other toilet users and toilet environments up to 2 meters away.
Microorganisms spread up to 0.25 meters from the dryer using a hand dryer with hot air.
Paper towels showed no significant proliferation of microorganisms. In 2005, a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt, evaluated various hand drying methods.
The following changes were observed in the calculation of bacteria after drying the hands:
Many different hand dryer manufacturers exist, and hand dryers have been compared with drying from paper towels.
Hand washing using hand sanitizer wipes in the absence of soap and water during the trip is an option.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness in disease prevention in the hospital environment (in 1846).
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study has found a reduction in infection rates by using them.
The hands are medically washed for a minimum of 15 seconds, in which foam is made using soap and water or a proper amount of gel and each part of the hands is rubbed.
The fingers of both hands should be rubbed with each other.
If there are debris under the nails, a hard-haired brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can live in the water on the hands, it is important to wash well and dry by wiping with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to turn off the water (and any exit doors should be opened if necessary).
This prevents the hands from being re-contaminated from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the health care system is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("pests") and prevent them from being transmitted.
According to the report of The New England Journal of Medicine, non-washing of hands in most medical environments remains at unacceptable levels, with a large number of physicians and nurses forgetting to wash their hands regularly before touching patients, leading to the transmission of microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures could reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by as much as 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-washing in health care sectors.
Document guidance on hand hygiene available by this organization can also be found on its website for public comment.
A relevant review was carried out by Witby and others.
Commercial equipment can measure and certify hand hygiene if performance of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has set out “five opportunities” for hand washing:
After coming into contact with blood/body fluid
prior to disinfection work, and
After patient care. Adding disinfectant chemicals to soaps (“medicinal” or “antimicrobial” soaps) provides the hand washing agent with a killing ability.
Before surgery or in an arrangement in which antibiotic resistant organisms are overly widespread, such an antidote may be desired. The surgical tear is a means to 'rub' your hands down, a tap that can be turned on and off without touching the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine washes, and a hand to dry after washing.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure usually requires washing the wrists up to the hands and elbows for 2-6 minutes.
There is no need to rub for a long time (10 minutes).
When washing, water on the wrists should be prevented from coming back to the hands.
After the completion of hand washing, the hands are dried with a disinfectant cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands before and after caring for a sick person or use a hand disinfectant.
For control of staphylococcus infection in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand cleaning came from the first 20% of washing, and when the frequency of hand cleaning increased by more than 35%, very little additional benefit was achieved.
Hand washing with plain soap, the rate of transmission of bactericidal disease is more than three times higher than washing with antibacterial soap. Hand rubbing with an alcohol-based solution is reduced by 26% compared to antibacterial soap. Hand washing with antibacterial soap is reduced by 30 minutes for the median time spent on hand rubbing with alcohol.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores by hand. Measures to improve hand hygiene in health care systems are education on hand washing of employees, can increase the availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and employees can get involved in written and verbal reminders.
More research is needed on which of these measures are most effective in different health care systems.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an affordable, essential means to achieve good health, and even good nutrition.
However, achieving universal hand washing behavior from a lack of reliable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities in people's homes, in schools, and at the workplace is a challenge.
For example, in most rural Africa every private or public toilet has very few hand washing taps, even though cheap options exist to build a hand washing station.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to inhaled habits rather than being caused by soap or water shortages.
The encouragement and support of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and bring about changes in the long-term behavior of the population.
For it to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation is necessary.
A systemic review of 70 studies found that community-based methods are effective at increasing hand washing at LMICs, while social outreach campaigns are less effective. An example for hand washing promotion in schools is the “three-star method” by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, along with other hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are achieved, schools can go from one to three stars, respectively.
Making a hand washing station can be a part of hand washing campaigns that are done to reduce diseases and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign aimed at trying to bring about behavioural change. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Some studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to prevention from DALYs.
However, a review shows that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health – especially people with sensitive conditions, such as mothers who have given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was first identified by two promoters of hand hygiene in the mid-19th century: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, Englishman who is the “founder of modern nursing.”
At that time most people believed that the infection was caused by a foul smell called myasmus.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and health-related infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively increase hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with “right hand washing techniques” were hung in public toilets and in office buildings and airports in Germany near hand washing sinks.
The phrase “washing your hands” from something means declaring your unwillingness to take responsibility for that thing or to embrace it.
It derives from the Bible’s Matthew chapter where Pontius Pilate distanced himself from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it became a phrase with much wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up a fictitious stain, which reflects her guilty conscience about the crimes she committed and her husband's motivation to commit the crime.
It has also been found that people wash their hands more often than others, after remembering or contemplating immoral actions, and attach more importance to hand washing equipment.
In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such contemplation are less likely to engage in compensatory tasks of other "cleaning" such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Hand washing is a part of the ritual hand washing described in many religions, including Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD> religion, Hinduism, Tevil<0xC3><0xAD>a and Netil<0xC3><0xA1>t Yad<0xC3><0xAD>m in Judaism, Lav<0xC3><0xA1>bo in Christianity, and Vazu in Islam. Religions also advise hand washing especially to provide hygiene after certain actions.
In Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands after using the toilet.
And, in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal.
Control of the risks of the spread of COVID-19 infection at the workplace
Control of the risks of spreading COVID-19 infection at the workplace, for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are applications of occupational safety and health procedures for the control of threats.
Depending on the appropriate control of the risk of disease spread at the workplace, the workplace and the work to be done, which are based on the risk assessment of sources of contact, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual personnel who are at higher risk of getting COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact risk actions have minimal business contact with people and other colleagues, including recommending basic infection prevention measures: hand washing, encouraging personnel to stay home if they are sick, following respiratory etiquette, and regular cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment.
Medium contact risk tasks are those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19 infection, but who may have been infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes personnel who have contact with the general public such as schools, high population-density work environments, and some high-volume sales arrangements.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, risk control measures for this group include: ventilation from high-efficiency air filters, using sneeze guards, and maintaining personal protective equipment available for that situation if a COVID-19 infected person is exposed.
OSHA considers those health workers and dead-house personnel to be at high contact risk, who come into contact with a COVID-19 infected or suspected person, and this risk increases to a higher contact risk if personnel perform procedures that produce aerosols on a COVID-19 infected or suspected person, or collect or handle samples from them.
Controls of hazards suitable for these personnel include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation chambers and personal protective equipment suitable for work.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have many effects within the workplace.
Personnel may be absent from work for fear of being sick, needing to care for others, or for fear of possible contact.
What goods are in demand, and the means of obtaining these goods (such as short-demand times or purchases through delivery or moving services), can change the nature of the business both in relation to demand.
Finally, the movement of objects from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be affected. The preparation and response plan for an infectious disease can be used to direct protective actions.
Plans address the risk levels associated with various workplaces and job functions, including the source of risk, the risk factors arising from home and community arrangements, and the risk factors of individual personnel such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline the controls required to address those risks and contingency plans for the circumstances that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparation and response plans for infectious disease may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
Targets for response to an outbreak include: reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at high risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other units in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease affects the responses to be adopted in a community with a place of business.
A sequence of threats controls is a structure that is widely used to group threats controls according to effectiveness in occupational safety and health.
Where COVID-19 threats cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls include separating employees from work-related hazards without depending on the employee's behavior, and this may be the most economical solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in work policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent certain contacts.
All types of PPE should be selected on the basis of risk to personnel, properly fitted (e.g., respirators), regularly and properly worn, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as required, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact risk tasks have minimal professional contact with people and other coworkers.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include: repeatedly and thoroughly washing hands, encouraging personnel to stay at home if they are sick, providing respiratory etiquette, tissues and waste vessels covering cough and sneeze, regular use of remote or parallel stools, preparing personnel and others if necessary.
Early identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals at the workplace is an important step in protecting personnel, customers, visitors, and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute schizophrenia stay at home until they are free of fever, fever signs, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medications, and that employees be flexible in health leave policies that allow employees to stay home and care for sick family members.
According to OSHA, medium-contact risk actions include actions that require repeated or close contact within six feet (1.8 meters) with people who are not known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19, but may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission running around the business location, or because the person has recently traveled to a location with extensive COVID-19 transmission internationally.
These include personnel who have contact with the general public, such as schools, high population-density work environments that may be vulnerable to COVID-19, the need to address barriers to access the workplace, the need to address the needs of individuals who are exposed to COVID-19, the need to address the needs of others, and the need to address the needs of workplaces that are sensitive to COVID-19, the need to address the needs of workplaces that are addressed, and the need to address the needs of workplaces that are addressed.
Personnel in this risk group rarely require the use of respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect personnel and other passengers include: removing the sick person from others by up to 6 feet, nominating a crew member to serve the sick person and giving the sick person a face mask or asking the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The crew must wear disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing, potentially wearing additional personal protective equipment.
Gloves and other consumables should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, postpone travel if sick under the control of hazards and self-isolation and immediately notify the medical center of the onboarding symptoms if another person develops a fever while boarding the ship or
Ideally, medical follow-up should be done in the room of the quarantined person. For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning or disinfecting if an infected person has been in a school building without community transmission.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as field trips, gatherings and other large gatherings such as canceling meals in physical education or singing classes or restaurants, increasing the distance between desks, shifting arrival and holiday times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is adequate transmission in the local community, extended school holidays may be considered in addition to strategies to create social distancing. For law enforcement personnel performing daily law activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to contact confirmed or suspected individuals with COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during catching, personnel should clean and disinfect their duty belts and equipment before reusing, using household cleaning sprays or wipes, and follow standard operating procedures for the prevention and disposal of used PPE, and for the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers some healthcare and dead-house personnel to be in high or very high categories of contact risk.
High-contact risk actions include providing health care, assisting, laboratory and medical transport personnel who come in contact with known or suspected patients of COVID-19.
These become very high contact risks if personnel perform procedures that generate aerosols on known or suspected patients of COVID-19, collecting or handling samples from them.
The processes that produce aerosols include duct penetration, phlegm induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental procedures and examinations, or collecting a sample from a rip-off.
High-contact risk mortuary functions involve people who prepare the bodies of individuals with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; these become very high contact risk if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation chambers for known or suspected patients of COVID-19, including during performing aerosol-producing procedures.
Specific negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care and mortuary arrangements.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients, depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case, be isolated in different waiting areas. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for individuals who work within 6 feet of known or suspected patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who produce aerosols that produce procedures.
In the U.S., N95 filtering facepiece respirators or better approved by NIOSH should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit-testing, training, and medical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide more protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend coveralls, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through bodily fluids.
The WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening personnel at the entrance.
For those who are collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-producing procedures, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles face shield, chokes and gloves.
If an aerosol-producing procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, requiring only the use of PPE required for specific function, minimizing the need to use the same respirator without removing PPE, inspecting and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and individuals with the same diagnosis.

Remittance Date/Time: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licensing: CC0: No rights reserved
There are extraordinary circumstances around us this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made clear the interconnectedness of all human beings in the world and our responsibilities towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented for us, but we know that our best response depends on global empathy, mutual cooperation, and community enrichment, which is at the heart of this organization.
The kind of camaraderie we’ve seen among all our colleagues over email, calls and chats is an extraordinary testament to how much extraordinary human beings we’ve been blessed to work with.
I am so grateful and proud to have you all as co-workers that I cannot put into words.
Last week, one person shared with me the appreciation of our work.
He reminded me how meaningful it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia right now, and what a powerful symbol of this vital resource being online and available to all.
Your work makes it possible, whether you keep the sites running or the source of our co-workers’ salaries or keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information it gets from Wikipedia, and now it needs it the most.
This is a moment in which our work, and our way of doing it, will both have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of this mission, and the importance of your role in it, we are going to make some significant changes to the way we work with you this coming week.
Changes in our work and schedules
As Robin pointed out earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our methodology and to prepare a timetable for the days and months to come.
In that conversation, we considered the appropriate response to the situation before us, and the best way to sustain the organization during this time.
We were overwhelmed and we wanted to ease the tension and support our mission for a long time.
If you have to reduce your work, there is nothing wrong with it.
For all staff, contractors, and contract personnel:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We're not declaring a holiday - if you're able to work more than normal hours, the mission needs your help.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, bring groceries, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We are not counting your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
We don’t have to say it, but we do say it.
No illness leave or PTO required – just let your manager know and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to make sure the main areas of work are visible.
(If you have been confirmed to have COVID-19, please let Brian of T&C Ops know so that T&amp;C can assist you and ensure that appropriate management attention is paid to your situation.)
Full-time employees will be paid.
We have already said, and we are once again reaffirming our commitment to deliver on our commitments to our contractors and hourly staff colleagues.
Everyone will receive a salary based on his or her normal working hours during normal circumstances.
Even if you are sick and cannot work, you will get a salary.
If you want to work, we are with you.
Many people use their work as a way to get out of the stress associated with the world around them.
What we can do can be extremely gratifying, especially at such a time.
Once again, taking care of yourself is the most important thing.
We ask that you talk to your manager, so that we know what to expect, and then we can adjust accordingly.
Some things are considered essential.
There are some things that we can’t stop.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Security, and grant pooling teams (and others) perform over-the-counter tasks that may require additional support.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess the existing objectives and to focus our attention on supporting things that are essential to our mission
We all have a lot to do, we’ll all just focus on the most essential projects.
By reducing the speed now, we will be able to avoid injury later.
We have no plans to "doubly time to compensate" after the global pandemic has passed.
You will no longer be required to work extra hours to meet deadlines beyond reality.
We believe that circumstances have changed, and we will work towards setting new goals and deadlines where appropriate.
What will happen to the app (annual planning)?
In order to adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we seek to revise the timeline to meet our 2020-2021 annual plan.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan so that we can have more time to budget, so that employees can prioritize their over-important work, self-care, and care for loved ones, and adjust those who need or want to work on a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.
This extension of the deadline will significantly reduce our current planning workload and pressure across the organization.
We will put our proposal before the board of directors next week and we will notify delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as we receive confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Office status, contact, and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, with great care, we deployed an antiviral cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
She disinfected every surface, the lobby, and the elevator bank that came up to our floor from the hospital-grade anti-viral solution.
The building is implementing its own Care-Duty Protocol using products that support the safety of its residents.
We are confident that the office will be ready when we return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork that has shared its COVID-19 protocols with us and all DC-based staff members.
Last week, our DC office in San Francisco adopted a fully remote system in line with the guidance shared with us.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, there is also ongoing discussion of leasing a location in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working from home for the first time.
Our co-workers who have been working from home for a long time know that adjustments will be needed for this, and they want to give you some advice:
Limit meetings time to a maximum of one or two hour increments.
If more long sessions are needed, consider dividing them by several days.
Define meetings clearly, keep the agenda ready, and send reading materials in advance.
Make video your default choice with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and collaboration.
Take the initiative to make every meeting easier, one person to monitor chats for questions and account for the speaker list, and one person to help take notes (or take notes from each other).
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to tech support.
Use your health insurance for emergencies.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is scrutinising webinar-based workforce guidance to support the increased delivered work across the entire foundation.
This past week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public programs, such as the Editathon, until the WHO announces an end to the global pandemic.
We told them that we understand that our request for cancellation and other sanctions may make it impossible to carry out their mutually agreed grant activities, and that no one will be punished for being forced to delay or amend those goals.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and topical community conferences.
This constraint creates a feeling of sadness in the global community as a whole, but also a sense of relief from the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, on Wikimedia and otherwise.
Going forward, CRT is working to organize a page on the Met-Wiki with the aim of providing a place for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Maintaining contact regarding COVID-19 related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to provide additional updates, answer your questions, and spend a little time connecting with each other.
We are in this together and we are there to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find information from this email on Office Wiki, and all other essential COVID-19-related information.
The CRT will keep these pages up-to-date and keep all the information in one place.
We are also currently working to maintain regular communication with employees living in significantly affected countries.
If you have a question about travel, events, a major workweek, or a coverage challenge, or if you need help with anything else, please feel free to inform CRT and work with it.
We are here to help provide support and establish relationships as needed.
If your case is confidential or sensitive, please send an email to Brian Juden, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as an abdication of our duties and responsibilities.
Rather, they recognize that at this time, our actions and obligations are likely to need to be adapted in a way we have never done in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue to act, provide our activities with the support they need, and provide the service the world depends on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us.
At the moment, it’s time to help each other, and make room for the important work to come in the coming weeks and possibly the months ahead.
We need all of you to make this possible, and so we want you all to take care of yourself and your families, so you can be at your best when needed.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doren D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Linnet L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Jenine U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 balances the activation of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing the angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also serves as an entry point into cells for certain coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as HACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of the intestinal and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptide M2 domain and the C-terminal collector renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is the type I membrane protein that once crosses the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues with the enzymatically active domain exposed.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is decomposed from the parietal domain by another enzyme called sheds, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly attached to the cell membranes of lung type II atherosclerosis cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, artery and venous intestinal cells and in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebrospinal vault, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain column.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as the genius of ACE.
ACE breaks down the angiotensin I hormone into the vessel-shrinkage angiotensin II.
ACE2 then dissociates the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and makes it into the vessel-expanding angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Hr-Tyr-I).
ACE2 can also decompose many other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradycaine, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates membrane transport of the nostalgic amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and its role has been reported in Hartnup disease.
As a parietal protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 bind to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of the cells of the receptor S1 protein causing the transfer of both viruses and enzymes to the endocytosis and endosms located within the cells.
This admission process also requires the infusion of S protein by the nutrient serine protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under current scrutiny as a potential therapy. This has led some to hypothesize that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional bodies and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that “the use of ACE inhibitors compared to controls was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia.”
Also, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially in people with trauma and heart failure."
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less prominent than the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be the new therapy for acute lung damage, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pig babies with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes with a 24-hour effect.
Numerous findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people with intolerance to excellent renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases in which there is an increase in circulating angiotensin II. Acute respiratory distress syndrome has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of rhACE2.
COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to assist in contact tracing in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Several applications were developed or proposed with official government assistance in some areas and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for building contact tracing applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially about systems that are based on tracking of app users' geographic location.
The low interception option involves the use of Bluetooth signals to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has employed an app in combination with Alipay, allowing citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is being used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, which was released as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app “StopKorona!” to detect contact with potentially infected individuals and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said the contact tracing app was at an advanced stage of development, and would be available for planning within weeks. A similar app (“StopCovid”) has been employed in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geofencing app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, which is designed to ensure they don’t leave the house.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed several potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positive cases and a potential lack of effectiveness if app use is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple limited the number of "official" or otherwise reputable organizations to determine which types of organizations can include coronavirus-related apps in its App Store.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have expressed their concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on such surveillance.
The organizations declared eight conditions on government projects:
The monitoring must be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
There should be a comprehensive section for the expansion of supervision and monitoring;
The use of the data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data protection and anonymity should be protected and represented protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should be avoided by promoting discrimination and de-authorization;
Any sharing of data with third parties must be defined in the law;
There should be measures to protect the rights of citizens to respond to abuse and to respond to abuse;
“Relevant participation” will be required by all “relevant stakeholders” including public health experts and rights groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohn Grenagen) (RSF) have also issued checklists.
The purpose of the proposed Google/Apple plan is to address the problem of continuous monitoring by removing the tracing mechanism from their device operating systems when it is not needed.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to unrefined location data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to personal location data; many privacy-protection systems have been created that only use central servers for interoperability (see section below).
A non-app-based system was used to do contact tracing in South Korea.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined these to generate notifications through text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available due to far-reaching changes to information privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Several countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy-protection systems.
As of April 6, 2020, these details were not yet released.
Tracing privacy-protection contact with a large body of research literature since at least 2013 is a well-established concept. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log proximity to one user’s other cellphones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination-effort that includes both centralized and decentralized methods, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy-protection proximity tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly contact event number, CEN), privacy-sensitive protocols and other mechanisms for mobile contact tracing.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never goes out of the device, and all matching takes place on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-preserving technologies when collecting and using location or path intersection data for tracking the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on research in the white paper “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Epidemic” released in March 2020. A similar effort is SafeTrace by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technology, which was originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies, allowing users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCN alliance was founded by groups that essentially came together in the context of similar approaches and largely similar protocols, aimed at reducing fragmentation, and enabling the global interoperability of tracing and warning apps, which was an important aspect of achieving comprehensive optimization.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it has open-sourced the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government apps.
On April 10, 2020, Google and the companies that control Apple, Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing, which they claimed would preserve privacy based on a combination of Bluetooth low-energy technology and privacy-preserving cryptography.
He also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be made available in three phases:
Providing tools to enable governments to create official privacy-protection coronavirus tracing apps
This functionality is directly integrated into iOS and Android.
Drug repurposing (also known as drug repurposing, re-profiling, re-appointment or remedial modification) is the repurposing of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease or medical condition other than the one for which it was originally developed.
It is a system of scientific research that is currently being adopted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research instructions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the well-being-related plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 target proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
The analysis of those binding sites provides an appropriate project to develop an effective antiviral drug to protect against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussain and others studied a number of candidate compounds, which then adapted and analyzed for their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of an effective SARS-CoV-2-antibody drug in a pre-clinical study to be recommended in a clinical study structure.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used to protect against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that tests for New York State’s chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trials procedure and is authorized under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but are not able to receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC has stated that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors have said they are using the drug when "there is no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed Favipiravir to be "clearly effective."
In Shenzhen 35 patients tested negative on an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted on 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of the patients received favipiravir and half received omefenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the current evidence in support of the drug is very low and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for its reserves, and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has sent a proposal to the Trump administration about buying the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease, where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A combination of antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, a study of lopinavir/ritonavir (calatra), concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were created to block HIV from replicating by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There have been criticisms within the scientific community about directing resources to repurpose drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO has included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdesivir had artificial environmental antiviral activation to protect against many phylo-, pneumo-, paramexo- and corona-viruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious disease and transmission.
Some preliminary pre-test studies suggest that Remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two tests conducted by the University of Cleveland Hospital; one for people with moderate disease and the other for people with more severe disease.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for hospitalized and critically ill people with COVID-19; two placebo controlled (in China, Canada) and one without any control (in Italy).
New York State began testing for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, Tizen's Elvesco (Sicilosodyne), for the treatment of patients with pre-existing symptoms from the novel coronavirus.
A Phase II trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is underway with 200 patients admitted from severe, hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of Colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolling 6,000 adults aged 40 years and older who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and are experiencing mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who are not using an effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
A number of anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular heparin is being widely used to treat patients, which is why the Italian drug agency has published guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study on 300 patients researching the use of annoxaperine sodium at prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced on April 14 in Italy.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on the repurposing of approved anti-viral drugs, which were developed for previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment as per Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment as per Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially reusable as COVID-19 treatments include:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
Also testing in Italy and China. See also Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine to protect against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several efforts are being made to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it does not expect a vaccine to be available in less than 18 months to protect against SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus.
Five vaccine candidates were in the first phase of safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread across the world in 2020, leading to considerable investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines to protect against SARS-CoV-2.
As reported in April, the essentials of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale planning and global learning.
In April, scientists at CEPI reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during the beginning of 2020 to create effective vaccines to protect against COVID-19.
Advanced major platform goals in Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others have been declared, but less public information is available (being designed or envisaged in planning).
Initial safety and immunogenicity tests are performed in a Phase I-II trial, this is usually done at random, placebo-controlled, and multiple sites, setting more accurate, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group monitoring adverse effects at optimal doses, and testing the effectiveness of the vaccine for disease prevention.
Of 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed as early as April 2020), 74 were still not in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" research).
Around January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to induce an immune response.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine, aiming to begin human trials in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced on 26 January 2020 at the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and on 28 January at the University of Hong Kong.
On January 29, 2020, the Haneke Schuttemaker-led Yansen Pharmaceutical Company announced that it had begun work on developing a vaccine.
Yansen is developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the laboratory OncoGen in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine similar to the technology used for neoantigen vaccination therapy of cancer.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had finalized the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting trials.
On 27 February 2020, Nugenrex Immuno-Oncology, a generics subsidiary, announced that they are launching a vaccine project to create a Ly-Ki peptide vaccine to protect against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "within 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, Western Maryland, both announced they were working on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it was in the development and manufacture of the vaccine.
Novavax will work closely with Inc.
The partners announced plans for a preclinical trial and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, India's health ministry announced that they were working with 11 decommissioners, and that even on a fast track it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle under partial financing from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, which has plans for human testing for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "large sums of money for special access to a COVID-19 vaccine" that the German government opposed.
On 17 March 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop the mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162, is currently in pre-clinical testing, with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that they would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that tests on their final vaccine candidate could be started by autumn.
On 19 March 2020, in France, The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in the COVID-19 Vaccine Research Association, including Institute Pasteur, Themis Biosciences (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which invests a total of US$29 million in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine.
Other investment partners of CEPI for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, CureVac, Innovio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford and University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-promoted RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
This vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical measures to protect against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates from Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine specifically with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the testing of a potential COVID-19 vaccine PittCoVacc in rats, stating that "MNA-provided SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines have induced antigen-specific antibody responses [in rats], which began to clear up 2 weeks after vaccination."
On 16 April 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to protect against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities pooled resources for learning from IBM to supercomputers, in conjunction with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have additional benefits from the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia is asking 4,170 health workers to be recruited.
It is possible that vaccines will not be safe or effective in development.
Early research assessing vaccine efficacy using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates the need for bio-safety level 3 containment measures to combat the live virus and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines have been tested for protection against SARS and MERS in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no certified vaccine to protect against MERS.
When MERS became widespread, it was thought that existing SARS research could provide a useful blueprint for developing vaccines and treatments to protect against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are in progress, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one is MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS).
Social media posts have fueled a conspiracy, claiming that there was knowledge about the virus responsible for COVID-19 and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other breeds of coronavirus such as the SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms can include fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can also be from two to fourteen days.
Although symptoms are mild in most cases, viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure develop in some cases.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus mainly spreads between people during close contact, often through small droplets generated by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these droplets arise when exhaling, they usually fall to the ground or to the surfaces rather than being infectious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a dirty surface and subsequently touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and at later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharynx swab.
It is recommended to use masks for those who suspect they are infected with the virus and also for their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, some authorities recommend not using them, some recommend their use, and others make their use necessary.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking up, and blueness of the face or lips; it is advisable to seek immediate medical care when these symptoms are present.
Less commonly, symptoms of the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in different percentages.
In some cases of China, initially only chest tightness and rapid heartbeat were observed.
In some cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, multi-organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of individuals who develop symptoms develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. The information shows that not all people with comorbidities develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not exhibit symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their stay in hospital.
China’s National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; 130 (78%) of 166 infections that day were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both mucus and saliva can have large amounts of viral.
Talking in a high voice results in more drops than talking in a normal voice.
A study in Singapore found that droplets that go up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) can be generated from a non-covered cough.
Although the virus is not airborne in general, the National Academy of Sciences has reported that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and samples from air collectors stationed in corridors outside people's rooms tested positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as duct penetration and heart pulmonary therapy (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions to form aerosols and thus airborne transmission.
Although there are concerns that it can spread through feces, this risk is considered low. This virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although the spread is possible before symptoms emerge, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person normally infects two to three other individuals. The virus survives on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) a day on cardboard, and up to four hours on 99% copper.
Even then, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and deodorants are also effective if used correctly; soap products decompose the fatty protective layer of viruses and inactivate them, as well as freeing them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization began.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral volume, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral volume on the second day of the trial.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a group of cases of acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the respective coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed with household soap, which breaks down its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
Lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus reaches the host cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in lung type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "bark" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage was found in 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China and is more common in severe disease.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to somatic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly manifested in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
Patients in ICUs with COVID-19 infections have been found to have a high prevalence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) which may be related to poor disease diagnosis. In autopsy examinations of people dying from COVID-19, radiated alveolar damage (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing inflammation within the lung have been found to be external substances.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a follow-up to the ACE2-disruptive epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of somatic hyperpigmentation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-liquid T-cells were shown to be correlated with the selection of inflammatory IL-6-liquid monocytes in COVID-19 patients and severe lung disease.
Lymphocytic external substances have also been reported in the autopsy.
The WHO has published a number of test protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharynx swab; however, a nasal swab or mucus sample may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples to be taken within a two-week interval and the immediate value of the results is low.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infection and whether a person was previously infected) were in development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experience with the test has shown that the purity is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the US approved the first care-of-the-spot test for use at the end of that month on March 21, 2020. Clinical guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University outlined ways to detect infection based on clinical facilities and epidemiological risk.
Bipolymeric ground-glass ambiguities with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in early infections.
When the disease progresses, subpleural dominance, crazy paving (thickening of the palate walls with variable atherosclerosis fillers), and solidification may appear.
There are fewer statistics available about the microscopic lesions of COVID-19 and the disease body action.
The main pathological findings obtained from the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleural edema, pericarditis, lung solidification and pulmonary edema in the pleural lining
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte overgrowth, large unattractive pneumocytes, intracellular inflammation with lymphocytic endocrine and multicenter massive cell formation
Severe pneumonia: radiated aerosol damage (DAD) with radiated aerosol leakage.
DAD is caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe short-oxygenation.
Treating pneumonia: Management of leaks and pulmonary intramuscular fibrosis in the aortic cavity
Blood: Circulatory intravascular stenosis (DIC); leukoarthroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently and for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public settings to limit transmission by partially asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected individuals with large groups, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
Distance-building guidelines also include that people stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away.
There is no drug known to be effective at preventing COVID-19. Since the vaccine is not expected until at least 2021, an important part of the management of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the pandemic, which is called "reducing the curve."
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands appear dirty, before eating and after spraying, coughing or sneezing their noses.
Additionally, it recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. In areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial action originates from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to aid in the elimination of bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand sepsis."
Glycerol is added as an admixture.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include providing fluid therapy, oxygen support, and other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of being infected with the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.
Assistive treatments may be useful in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for caring for people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the US have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free source, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical personnel recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for primary use.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care systems, when procedures that produce aerosols such as duct penetration or hand ventilation are performed.
For health workers caring for individuals infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping the person in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions. The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE bedding, respirators or face masks, eye protection equipment, and medical gloves. When available, respirators (rather than face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial arrangements, but the FDA has authorized masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for non-approved experiments.
The CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks when masks are not available.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require mechanical ventilation or other options, but only in a few percent of cases.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied for hospitalized people, with some evidence that duct penetration with high flow nasal passageway or bi-level positive airway pressure can be avoided.
Whether either of these two provides the same benefit to critically ill people is not known.
Some clinicians prefer to use enteric mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow nasal cannula. Severe cases are most common in older adults (over 60 years of age and especially over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, limiting the ability of a health system to handle a sudden increase in the number of severe COVID-19 cases that necessitate hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% required mechanical support for ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and it becomes increasingly difficult to provide oxygen.
Ventilators capable of pressure control systems and high PEEP are needed to maximize oxygen distribution while reducing the risk of ventilator-associated lung damage and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and many antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may be developed by 2021, many of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in a progressive trial.
An attempt may be made to give antiviral medication in people with severe disease.
The WHO has recommended volunteers to participate in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has temporarily allowed health-beneficial plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where there is a serious or immediate risk to the person’s life.
There have not been enough clinical studies to show that it is safe and effective for this disease.
China launched a mobile app in February 2020 to combat the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
This app is able to detect the potential risk of infection by detecting 'near contact' using surveillance data.
Each user can also view the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but it also alerts local health authorities. Big data analyses for cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracing and artificial intelligence are used to trace infected people and the people they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to trace mobile phone data of people suspected of coronavirus.
The measure was implemented to enforce quarantine and protect people who come in contact with infected citizens.
Also, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to prevent the spread of the virus and research.
Russia employed facial recognition technology to detect those violating quarantine.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Julio Galera said he had been informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are moving in some way."
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience distress from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
"Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and an economic downturn are ideal storms that harm people's mental health and well-being," the BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying.
The disease may have a mild course of action with or without some of the symptoms similar to other common upper respiratory tract diseases such as common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while cases with severe or severe diseases can take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe infection with COVID-19, but there is a decrease in statistics for COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia by affecting the lungs.
In the most severely affected people, COVID-19 can develop rapidly in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, epileptic trauma, or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal stenosis and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Skandan abnormalities, particularly an increase in prothrombin time, have been reported in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function is observed in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 exhibit an increase in liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same information, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had an average time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In one study of early cases, the average time from exhibiting early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by China’s National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate was 2.8% in men, while the mortality rate was 1.7% in women.
Tissue pathology examinations of lung samples of autopsy shows radiated atherosclerosis with cellular fibromyalgia leaks in both lungs.
Pneumocytes had observed viral cell pathological changes.
The lung picture appeared similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Of the 11.8% deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage was noted by high levels of troponin or heart rate stops.
According to U.S. March data, 89% of people hospitalized had preexisting conditions. The availability of medical resources and the socioeconomic status of an area can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the condition also vary due to those regional differences and system related difficulties.
The mortality rate may be overestimated due to low count of mild cases.
However, the fact that death is the result of cases that occurred earlier may mean that the current mortality rate has been underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die. Concerns have been expressed about the long-term post-menopausal symptoms of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% drop in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infection provides effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Immunity is seen as potential depending on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases of positive testing for coronavirus have been reported at a date after recovering from COVID-19.
These cases are thought to be worse of an uncorrected infection rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be of an animal origin transmitted through natural and animal-to-human transmission.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely by human-to-human transmission.
In a study of the first 41 cases of COVID-19 confirmed, published in The Lancet in January 2020, the earliest date of onset of symptoms was reported as 1 December 2019.
The WHO's official publications reported the earliest onset of symptoms 8 December 2019.
A number of measures are commonly used to determine mortality.
These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time from the initial outbreak, and the characteristics of the population such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO prescribed emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the laboratory and disease code U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 diagnosed clinically or epidemicly without SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by the laboratory. The death-case ratio is divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a certain time interval.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-case ratio as of 17 April 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
The numbers vary by region. Other measures include case fatality rates (CFR), which reflect the percentage of individuals diagnosed with a disease dying, and infection mortality (IFR) which reflects the percentage of infected persons dying from a disease (diagnosed and undiagnosed).
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to case recovery.
Although not all infected people develop immunity, the presence of the immune can provide information about how many people have been infected.
In the center of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Ada, in a small village of 4600 people, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangolt, the disease was spread by carnival festivals and among young people, reducing the relatively low mortality rate, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been formally classified.
In addition, the German health system is not crumbling.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, according to evaluations from blood donors.
The death toll from COVID-19 has been confirmed to be 69 (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate varies for men and women.
The mortality rate in men is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women decreases only at age 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this gender gap are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors can be a cause.
Gender-based immunological differences, low prevalence of smoking in women, and developing co-morbid conditions in men such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women may contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government is not tracking gender-related statistics of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19."
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told that CO means corona, VI means virus, D means disease, and 19 means the year when the outbreak was first identified i.e. 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), species of animals or group of people that are in line with international recommendations for nomenclature for the purpose of preventing humiliation. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO additionally uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus."
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and " Wuhan coronavirus."
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV as interim names for the virus and disease of acute respiratory disease, which complies with the 2015 guidelines for not using spaces in the disease and virus names.
The formal names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health materials such as Nasika Fah and parts of ventilators.
In one instance, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to provide the required time-frame, a local startup printed the required 100 valves overnight by doing reverse-engineering.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy, misinformation and misleading information about the origin, level, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no medicine or vaccine approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs in COVID-19 is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "solidity trial" to assess the treatment effects of the four existing antiviral compounds with the highest hope of efficacy.
There is no vaccine available at the moment, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being examined.
First, the researchers aim to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such viruses, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain sub-parts of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on S-bitter proteins that help the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is to have nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technology to make vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies will have to be tested for safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. The antibody-dependent growth has been described as a potential challenge to vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted.
Seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
With nine Phase III trials on Remdesivir scheduled to be reported by the end of April, most Chinese research is working on repurposed antiviral drugs.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development was underway for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta combined with lopinavir/ritonavir.
As of March 2020, experimental evidence for the efficacy of Remdesivir is available.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with non-approved use of Remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, already used for the treatment of malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with initial results.
However, the equivalence of research has been called for review.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommended a daily dose of one gram, noting that twice that dose is extremely dangerous and can be life-threatening.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19. Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use for protection against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for the suppression of artificially ambient SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further study in organisms after indicating a low concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that initial kinetic protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
There are major limitations to the studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin, which have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit the synthesis of artificial ambient SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in COVID-19 treatment.
Increasing the amount of cytokines in the later stages of severe COVID-19 can be a complication.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent an increase in the amount of cytokines. Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
It is undergoing a phase 2 non-randomized trial nationally in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify an increase in the amount of cytokines, it aims to combat such growths, which are thought to cause death in some affected people.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonism was approved by the FDA in 2017, for a different reason, based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by CAR T cell therapy.
To date there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transmitting pure and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 to those who need them, is being tested as a non-vaccinated method of inactivated vaccination.
This strategy was used for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral apathy is the anticipated mechanism by which passive antibody therapy can mediate protection from SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using built-in monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The health-beneficial serum, which contains a liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and has specific antibodies to this virus, can be increased for faster planning.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan's central hospital, who tested positive for COVID-19 and died after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
