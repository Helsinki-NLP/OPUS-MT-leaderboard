Black box in your car.
While U.S. road planners are struggling with a lack of funds to repair the collapsed highway system, many are looking for a solution in a small black box that fits neatly on your car’s dashboard.
The device, which tracks every mile driven by a motorist and transmits that information to authorities, has now become a contentious issue for Washington and the State Planning Office to restore outdated systems to finance major U.S. roads.
In general, even boring work like highway planning has suddenly become an issue of intense debate and lively alliances.
Keeping details of the miles you drive, and possibly the location you drive — and then using this information to prepare tax bills — have teamed up with Librarian environmental groups to raise support in favor of allowing the government to use these black boxes.
The tea party is amazing.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned about raising a variety of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree on whether to take further action, many states were not waiting.
They are exploring how they can get into a system in which the driver pays for every mile decided on the road over the next decade.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black box for test drives, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is a really important thing for our country.
“It’s not a matter of us being elected or not elected,” says Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which plans to begin tracking every mile that motorists in California decide by the year 2025.
The way we pay taxes is going to change.
There is technology to do this.
The main reason for this happening is that the country's Highway Trust Fund has almost gone bankrupt, which is financed by paying taxes on gas pumps made by U.S. citizens.
Americans don’t buy gas as much as they used to.
The car now runs more miles in a gallon of gas than ever before.
There has been no increase in federal tax over the past 20 years, amounting to 18.4 cents per gallon.
Politicians avoid raising even a penny in taxes because of the high value of gas.
"Gas tax is not at all sustainable," says Lee Munikh, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
“In the long run it will serve as the most rational option,” he says.
Vonux calls it mileage-based user fees.
It is not surprising that this idea seems good to urban libertarians, because it can, for example, change taxes to change the way cars drive, which can help reduce congestion and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
California planners are keen on this system while they are developing strategies to meet the targets set in the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
But the chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip. Bill Schuster (IA-PA), also considers the black box as the most viable long-term option.
Independent sellers in the Region Foundation are also in favor of a per-mile payment by the driver.
"It's not just the tax that's going into the blind well," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Region.
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. transportation secretaries who, in their 2011 report, graced Congress with moving toward per-mile payments.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million test project last year that would have involved 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural law-makers, who were representing individuals who had to walk many miles daily to get to work or to the city, the House leadership ended the proposal there.
Yet many states and cities are moving in this direction themselves.
It has the most willing Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fee instead of the gas tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed the preliminary test.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is experimenting with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 alliance, which includes 17 state transportation departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) with the Eastern Seaboard, is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not find support everywhere.
In Nevada, where the device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers some time ago, drivers were very impatient thinking that the government could monitor their every move.
Alauddin Khan, who directs the strategic and performance management in the Nevada Department of Transportation, says, "Worrying about Big Brother and other similar things was the main problem."
It’s not something that people wanted.
As the trial progressed, Nevada’s ACLU warned on its website: “It would be largely easier to convert these devices into full-fledged tracking devices.”
There is no need to develop a vast, unmanageable technology infrastructure that must be spread to keep a record of each person’s daily movement.
Nevada is among the many states that are making every effort to get affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get details of how many miles the car is moving per day, but not where and at what time it is moving.
Khan said that if you can do that, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
The firm was originally not in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was attempting to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, with drivers having to pay based on their mileage.
But the device it is testing was well received by highway planners, because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by modems at certain intervals of time.
“If you don’t track people’s speed and their location, they’ll be more inclined to adopt this way,” said Ryan Morrison, the chief executive of True Mileage.
Some major mistakes have been made in these initial programmes of the state.
There are also very low-cost and low-intervention ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with different options for drivers.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or can choose not to take any device again, but instead choose to pay the prescribed fees based on the average miles to be determined by the residents of the state.
Other locations hope that this retention can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more convenience rather than less in the device.
In New York City, transportation officials are trying to develop a taxing device that will also facilitate paying parking meter fees, provide "pay as you drive" insurance, and create real-time speed data collection from other drivers that motorists can use to avoid traffic.
The city planning document mentions, "Motor-drivers will be attracted to participate in it due to the benefits it brings."
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps the whole discussion on payments by miles is a big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said Congress could very easily deal with the problem of bankrupt highway trust funds by increasing gas taxes.
Additional one-time or annual charges may also be levied on drivers of hybrid or other cars whose vehicles do not use much gas so that they pay their fair share.
“What is the need for radical surgery when aspirin can work,” said Randy Rentscheler, the commission’s director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do this, millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, he died due to drowning.
However, his friend has been detained by the police on charges of concealing the deceased's belongings.
The police have submitted the final report of the investigation into the death in the court.
On August 26, police had recovered the body of Zahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelum Darya.
His family had accused his friends of killing him as his mobile and other belongings were missing.
In the report, police said the deceased's phone and SIM were examined and it was found that his phone was being used by a woman in Soura.
During interrogation, the woman said that the call was given to her by one of her relatives, Ruhail Gauhar.
Ruhail also lives in Padshahi Bagh and was a friend of the late Zahid.
Ruhail had gone to take a bath with Zahid in Jhelum after Namaz-e-Jumma on August 25.
Zahid opened his clothes and put all the stuff on the shore, while Ruhail went to the other side to smoke a cigarette.
When he came back, Zahid was not there, only his clothes.
Ruhail searched for Zahid, but he could not be found.
He took his mobile phone, watch and other things and kept it for his use.
He did not tell anyone that Zahid had drowned.
The police told the court that Zahid died due to drowning and the post-mortem report also confirmed the same.
However, Ruhail has been taken into custody under Section 404 for concealing facts and belongings of the deceased.

Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 77, has married a 28-year-old woman in a secret affair.
This was revealed by his family friend, Martin Polanco.
According to him, Berlusconi, a three-time prime minister, has married former TV anchor Francesca Pascal in her private chapel.
Francesca met Baluscony when she was a teenage activist at the Forza Italia party.
It was Francesca, whose relationship with Baluscony was said to be merely a show-off.
Berlusconi's close friend and Bunga-Bunga girl, Marthal Polanco, has revealed that she was also invited to the secret wedding.
The event took place three weeks ago.
When asked what would happen if the two got married, Polanco said they were already married.
It was not a public event.
The wedding took place at a private chapel in the former Prime Minister's house.
Nothing else can be said.
However, he did not attend the wedding.
He has sent his greetings to the newlyweds.
The couple got married three weeks ago, on October 8 or 9.
About eight months ago, Francesca Pascal, a 28-year-old woman 50 years younger than her, got engaged.
In order to avoid kirkiri, Berlusconi based his decision on loneliness.
The rain continued intermittently in the low-lying areas of the state.
With this, cold wave has started in the entire plaintiff.
The minimum temperature was recorded at 4.8 degrees Celsius in Srinagar, minus 0.2 degrees in Gulmarg and minus -1.8 degrees in Leh.
Leh was the coldest place in the state.
Meanwhile, the Srinagar-Leh highway has been closed for traffic due to heavy rains and snowfall.
There has been heavy snowfall on the Jojila Pass.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall of this season in the hilly areas of Kashmir.
Due to the activism of the Western Disturbance, snow and rain started in the high mountain areas of the plaintiff early in the morning, which continued till late in the evening.
Normal life was also affected due to the cold.
People stayed at home to avoid the cold.
Power supply was also disrupted in many areas.
Srinagar recorded a maximum temperature of 13.7 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal.
At the same time, the night temperature has increased due to heavy rains in Jammu in the morning.
The minimum temperature in Jammu was recorded at 16.6 degrees Celsius while the maximum was recorded at 27.0 degrees Celsius.
According to the Meteorological Department, the impact of the western disturbance has started decreasing and the weather will improve from Friday.
According to Sonam Lotus, director of the Srinagar-based Meteorological Department, the weather in the valley is likely to be dry from November 1 to November 7.
Asaram, who is lodged in jail on charges of sexual assault, was once again disappointed by the Supreme Court on Friday.
The court rejected Asaram's plea that he was being portrayed as a blood-drinking Dracula in the media coverage, but rejected his demand for a ban on media coverage.
A bench headed by Chief Justice P Sathasivam refused to order the media to stop reporting on Asaram saying they have seen every word reported in the media and found no reason to interfere.
When they are getting information from the police and others, how can we stop them?
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer had accused the media of spreading rumours about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
The bench was not impressed by these arguments and refused to interfere in the matter, saying they had other options.
Earlier, the court had rejected Asaram's plea seeking a ban on media coverage.
The department officials claim that this is the biggest TDS theft case so far.
The group operator of the mall deducted TDS and paid to the concerned financial institutions but did not pay it to the government exchequer.
By doing this, the TDS money kept depositing with itself.
On October 17, the team, which had come from Mumbai, had acted in collaboration with the Jaipur investigation team.
The same link investigation revealed that this trader had deducted TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the TDS team had started the action of the Income Tax Survey on this group on Thursday.
The risk of the account being sealed was about 15 days before the raid and survey action was carried out on the group of this mall operator.
Aggrieved by the action, the businessman has made it clear to the Income Tax Department officials that he is not ready to pay TDS money to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is constantly targeting them.
Officials investigating the case have made it clear that in case of non-payment, recovery action will be taken by sealing the accounts.
With the advent of Diwali, the demand for sweets is increasing.
As a result, the sale of fake and fake currency is increasing.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more bright, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous for health.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched a campaign against fake mawa and chemical-rich sweets.
The department has seized Rs 70,000 from Mawa and Rs 5,000 from Quetta Colony in Madhya Pradesh.
With the increase in demand for sweets in the market, the demand for cheap mawa from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The department received information that the dirty maves were brought to Nagpur from Madhya Pradesh.
A consignment of Mave is being brought to Nagpur from the transport garage.
The police have recovered Rs 70,000 from the possession of the accused.
The fear of action has not left anyone in the lurch.
The department destroyed it by treating it as unclaimed property.
The department raided Jeetendra Caterers in Quetta Colony and recovered around 5,000 spectacles.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulfite was used to make the spoon shine and last longer.
The sample will be sent to the laboratory.
S S Deshmukh, joint commissioner of the department, said that the drive to arrest chemically sweet and substandard and fake mawes will continue.
In the next few days, information has been given by the department to speed up this operation.
Consuming these sweets can also lead to poisoning.
The department asked sweet traders to make sweets with good milk, mave.
An appeal has been made by the department to the people to beware of fake sweets and sweets.
He was received at the airport by 42 senior BJP leaders.
Modi is on a visit to Bihar for a BJP-led yatra.
Condolences to the families of those killed in the Patna blasts are being offered by the BJP.
A total of seven explosions were reported in Patna on October 27 during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Hunkar' rally.
The Indian Mujahideen terrorists, who were involved in the blasts, had intended to create a stampede during the rally so that more and more people could be killed and an atmosphere of terror was created in the state.
The terrorists' intention was not successful, but six people lost their lives in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
The party leaders have been on a tour since Thursday, carrying ashes from their village.
On November 5, the ashes of all of them will flow together in the Ganga in Patna.
As a part of this journey, Santhana Yatra is organized.
The main character is Narendra Modi.
They will visit the villages of those killed in the blasts since 7 am on Saturday and meet their families.
During the visit, he will also give a cheque of Rs 5 to the next of kin of the deceased.
The BJP has already announced its support.
The Indian cricket team will look to take on Australia in the seventh and final ODI at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.
After two consecutive ODI matches were washed out due to rain, India had to win the Nagpur ODI in any case to stay in the series and its batsmen gave them a record win in a spectacular performance, which led to the team level the series 2-2.
In the series, Team India has achieved the target of more than 350 twice and once again the responsibility of crossing the team's nose will be on the batsmen.
The Indian batting is at its peak at the moment and even the biggest target is proving to be a dwarf in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous form, but Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja will also be a lot of expectations for the team.
As far as opening is concerned, Rohit and Shikhar have got such an opening pair which is making the work of the rest of the batsmen easier with a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had a great opening partnership, giving Virat a chance to play without any pressure.
With Kohli's impressive performance at number three so far, he is considered the future Sachin Tendulkar.
In fact, many cricket pundits have described him as better than Sachin.
Virat, who will turn 25 next week, has scored 17 ODI centuries, out of which India have won 16 in the tournament.
His average is above 80.00 while chasing the target and he has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but excessive reliance on these three can also be detrimental to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj had flopped badly in the last match.
Yuvraj has not been able to open an account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, a good innings in Bangalore ODI can work as a 'lifeline' for them.
As far as Australia is concerned, their batsmen, especially captain George Bailey, have impressed everyone with their performance.
There is also a demand for him to be included in the Test squad for the home Ashes series against England.
Australia have good batsmen up to number nine.
Apart from Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voges and James Faulkner have batted well in the series.
However, Phil Hughes and Aaron Finch have not been able to make any impact in the opening match.
Mitchell Johnson's lack of bowling can be a heavy burden for Australia.
Johnson, who has performed brilliantly in the series so far, has been sent home to prepare for the Ashes series.
BJP national executive member and chief spokesperson Dr Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is working on a new policy of infiltration of terrorists in the guise of this ostentatious peace.
Referring to reports of intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued here on Wednesday that Pakistan was pushing for the heel peak to infiltrate around 2000 terrorists ready in its training camps.
For this, he will never allow peace on the border.
Pakistan has been in a state of turmoil ever since the separatists' plans to foment unrest in Kashmir on a large scale failed.
Referring to the visit of separatists to Pakistan last year, the BJP leader said ISI chief Lt Gen Zaheer-ul-Islam, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Hizb chief Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be fuelled in 2014.
Pakistan is committed to fulfilling this promise.
The killing of soldiers on the border, suicide attacks in Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Terming the demand for scrapping the Army's privileges in the state as "fatal" in such a situation, the BJP leader said it was also anti-people to say such things till there was lasting peace in the state.
These are anti-national elements.
He stressed that statements that demoralise the army and security forces of the leaders should be stopped.
Snow Dane ready to "cooperate" with Germany on U.S. surveillance
Edward Snow Dane, an American intelligence informant, has announced that he is willing to travel to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, fail to respond about his activities.
German MP Hans Christian Straw Belle, met Mr. Snow Dane in Russia on Thursday, where he has been granted asylum, to speak about his testimony in Germany.
The MP, in a letter presented by Mr Snow Dane to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: “While the results of my efforts are demonstrably positive, my government views dissent as party-change, and offers no defense that attempts to criminalize political speech with allegations of felony.”
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr Snow said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to drop criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the U.S. Department of Justice include theft of intelligence and government property.
Hans Peter Friedrich, the German Minister of Internal Affairs, told Zeit online: “If Mr. Snow Dane has been willing to talk to German authorities, we have to find ways to make it possible.”
Relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure after the NSA claimed to have bugged Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Operman, MP who is the chairman of the parliamentary committee, oversees intelligence, saying that if there had been an opportunity to hear Mr Snow Dane as a witness "without completely ruining relations with the US and putting them in danger," it should still be taken.
Mr.Belle, a member of the Green Party of Germany, posted a picture of himself with Mr. Snow Dane on the Twitter feed.
He was on his way to Russia with two German journalists.
According to the former NSA contractor's lawyer, Snow Dane is not able to return to Russia if he leaves Russia.
If Snow Dane testified in Germany he would be "safe" there who would need assurances, the MP said.
In his letter, Mr Snow Dane said he had faced "a frightening and sustained campaign" that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that the world is happy and overwhelmed by the wide-ranging responses "to its act of political expression."
World citizens, including the United States, as well as high officials, have hailed the revelation of an irresponsible system of comprehensive surveillance of a public service.
The letter expands a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities "when the problems of the humanitarian situation have been solved ."
Frontier Airlines Carry - On Baggage Charges
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 to store luggage carry-on for passengers on board their aircraft.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging $100 for a carry-on bag and will charge $2 for it, coffee or soda, though its announcement on Wednesday revealed that passengers can keep the entire compartment.
The new carry-on charge is for bags in the overhead bin, therefore, the small bags under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the advance is paid, $100 if the passenger would have to wait until they were at the gate to make the payment.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to be achieved to take care of the charge in advance of passengers.
"We don't want to charge it," he said.
The airline started charging for first and second check bags in 2008.
Those who are trying to avoid the passenger fee are stuffing as much as they can in carry-on baggage which is stashed in the overhead compartment, which means there is often less space in this compartment.
There is a way to bring down the fee for passengers on board.
O'Malley said it's not really about raising new charge money.
It has become increasingly difficult for the most loyal customers about Frontier to find the replacement of that overhead bin.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's own website do not have to pay for it.
This means that the next person in line may have to pay $100 for a similar bag, while a passenger in line at a frontier gate can get a bag for free.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to ensure passengers are aware of the fees before getting to the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on fee will not start until summer, although a date has not been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction about baggage charges and other charges, but the airline prefers them.
They argue that it costs money to handle baggage, and those who want passenger service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street are seen by many as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, have not touched carry-on bag charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. started the carry-on charge for the first time three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later.
One such fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, which airline consultant Jay Sorensen said, and which tracks add-on fees.
He said Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year which was estimated in a December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former executive at Midwest Airlines, recently flew to Spirit and expressed surprise at passengers having to face carry-on unusual bag fees at the gate.
"The boarding process was seamless which I had seen in my airline career," he said.
I was expecting to see teeth grinding and a fight out at the gate.
"The plane was full and he climbed the likety-split."
Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said that the passenger who will take soda, or juice can keep the entire box, and will give it free coffee only once.
It will still drain out the water.
U.S. Airways briefly tried to charge for beverages in 2008, but after passengers complained seven months later they withdrew and no other major airline followed after being there.
Frontier's move to charge carry-on charges if Frontier's passengers don't purchase directly from the airline is its latest attempt to operate customers towards its own website.
The airline pays the online travel vendor Orbitz such that $10 to $25 for each sold ticket.
This is why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from those instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has moved forward in this area.
In September, many often paid half the flight miles for customers who bought from these individuals from an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award by 25 percent of the trip mile.
So, a 1000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn 250 miles.
It also allows them to choose their seat in advance for the sole passengers when they buy directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home town of Denver, but its business is shrinking and it is losing money.
Revenue fell by 9 per cent and its flying capacity fell nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sale.
NSA accuses "internal error" instead of hackers for causing website crash
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that our website was down for a few hours due to some technical glitches, not due to hackers as some people claimed online.
“The NSA.gov was not in reach for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the pre-scheduled update,” the intelligence agency said in a statement sent by email.
This problem will be solved tonight.
The claim is not true that this obstruction, the distributed denial of service [DDoS] was caused by the attack.
In the evening, online server trackers discovered that the NSA's website had been down for at least six hours, and for some users the site was still inaccessible.
An NSA spokesperson told ABC News that there was "absolutely no agreement" with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
The spokesperson said that no classified information is under threat.
At least one hacktivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NSA's website by DDoS attacks.
The DDoS attack is designed in such a way that such a high amount of traffic is sent to the target website until the site is closed due to server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively unrefined and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former highly secretive NSA, which was once called "no such agency", has become a subject of discussion and bitter criticism among the general public in the wake of the occurrences of foreign and domestic spying programs in the past months - which have been collectively dispelled by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden and the secret NSA files stolen from the NSA.
Due to the increasing controversy about the agency, speculation was made after tonight's incident that the incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
A beautiful expression was presented in line with the 'Another Dronacharya' plot, which shows harmony in the Dwapar era and today's conditions.
It was shown that in today's context, in which chains a guru is bound to walk on the wrong path.
The programme was jointly inaugurated by Chief Guest MLA Prabhudayal Valmiki, Vice President of Cantonment Board Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh at the auditorium of St Joseph Inter College.
The play depicted the similarity of the circumstances of Dronacharya of the Dwapar era and presently a Professor Arvind.
Directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bechain, Hemant Goyal, Seema Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gazala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun, etc.
The play was directed by Jitender C. Raj and the set was designed by Hemant Kumar.
After this, various awards were given to literary and cultural personalities.
Dr Aslam Jamshedpuri, president of Urdu department of Charan Singh University, Shambhunath Shukla, senior journalist and theatre artist Jitender C. Raj were present on the occasion.
Among those present on the occasion were Abid Rizvi, Rakesh Kaushik and Surender Sharma.
Bombardier's profits decline as delivery of aircraft, orders fall
Canada's airplane and train maker Bombardier Inc. reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, in the third quarter in its train unit and on contract issues as pressure by plane orders and deliveries lower.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or present an update on the issues the aircraft will meet its ambitious program of moving into commercial service from next September.
Nearly a month and a half after the first flight of the test aircraft, it has been flown just three times, raising the question of whether the test phase is on track.
The result fell short of forecasts and the stock has sent for more than 8 percent sliding on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorsey, an analyst stock with National Bank Financial, lowered its rating for "field performance" from "Mat" on Thursday, when the stock is up over the next one or two quarters.
"Weak aircraft deliveries were mostly predictable, we are obviously disappointed with the margin performance in transportation," Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive new orders for Bombardier Cseries as the flight testing program progresses.
However, if any new orders are not announced in the coming months, the market will be skeptical of the schedule.
Bombardier hopes the plane family can now cut it off at the low end of the Boeing and Airbus-dominated market.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
Potential buyers wait for the result of the flight test to validate the company's claims about new jetliner fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as are medium to medium for confirmed orders for CSeries up to 177.
A total of 403 orders and commitments are available with operators of 15 customers.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Baudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jets were put into commercial use.
Officials assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme was going on as per schedule.
"The test aircraft stayed on the ground longer than anticipated," Boudoin said in a conference call, adding that land testing and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft's intermission.
Every manufacturer makes a schedule in a different way.
We decided to make a first flight and do an update period and said what we did.
That will be all through the flight program.
The second remaining part of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the following shortly after, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical that customers can start operating a CSeries aircraft after their first flight in the first 12 months.
Bombardier has stated that it evaluated the Service at Entry (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - reinforces our view that the service at the entrance will be pushed to Q1/15," Dorsen said.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million a year ago, or 8 cents per share, $172 million, or 9 cents per share.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue dipped modestly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to analysts Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, revenue of 10 cents per share and $4.56 billion was expected to be generated.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said 45 aircraft were delivered during the quarter, down from 57 a year ago.
The net order fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion on Sept. 30, with no change since Dec. 31.
"Aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the low-order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment," Baudoin said.
A 13 percent drop in aerospace revenue to $2 billion.
Bombardier said the division, the world's largest train manufacturer, had an almost 11 percent increase in revenue for $2.1 billion.
The transport unit in order backlogs were $32.6 billion of approximately 30 September, up marginally from December 31.
Some of the larger contracts in the margins of the transport division were also affected by execution issues.
Executives said the new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, in which Google Inc's chief financial officer Patrick Pitchett announced the board's joining, were also down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 in mid-afternoon trading on Thursday.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and closest rival to Bombardier, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
New research has shown that we work in the morning with full honesty and dedication.
No one is allowed to lie or steal.
But in the evening, our mind changes and we start moving against the rule by keeping the ideal aside.
Researchers from Harvard University and the David Eccles School of Business in Utah have given many interesting facts in this research.
According to the researchers, we prefer moral values without the stress of work in the morning, but in the evening, due to fatigue or high pressure, honesty decreases.
The researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked some people to tell the number of dots on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell whether the point is more to the left or to the right.
Participants were told that if they gave a wrong answer instead of the right answer, they would be given money.
In this experiment, it was seen that the people who were tested between 8 to 12 in the morning did not make any mistake and gave the correct answer.
At the same time, during the experiment on people between 12 noon and 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately gave wrong answers by keeping their principles at bay.
This led the researchers to prove that the greed for money in the morning does not matter to our honesty, but in the evening, we stop giving importance to morality.
The study was published in the journal Psychological Science.
After the robbery, the accused fled from the spot.
The injured have been admitted to a hospital in a serious condition.
Son of Sundar, a resident of Madhi village, Sohanveer has recently retired as an additional engineer from the power department.
On Wednesday, he was returning home by bicycle after withdrawing Rs 44,000 from the Syndicate Bank's Bhola branch.
Two bike-borne men on a bike snatched Rs 44,000 from Sundar on the Bhola-Marhi road.
When Sundar resisted, the miscreants shot him in his stomach, causing him injuries.
On being informed, the family members rushed him to a hospital in Meerut.
No case was registered till the filing of the report.
Three days ago, while returning home from the same bank, Jasvir, a resident of Ammanulapur, was shot dead by two bike-borne miscreants.
Apart from these, the police have not been able to reveal many other recent cases.
Meanwhile, SHO Sumer Singh Yadav claimed that the details of the incident would be revealed soon.
When the hotel staff protested, they started beating up the employees.
R K Singh, the younger brother of the hotel owner, was beaten up by the MP's son.
In the meantime, many more people came.
When he tried to catch the youth, he opened fire at him.
The firing spread panic in the area.
The hotel staff caught him and informed the police.
Munna Singh, the owner of the hotel, lodged a complaint against Anand Pandey, son of MP Gorakhnath Pandey, a resident of Barwa Paharpur under Koirana police station in Bhadohi district.
The police arrested Anand and seized his revolver.
According to Handia Inspector Ashok Saraswat, Munna Singh, a resident of Khabhor in Pratapgarh, runs a hotel named Rag Darbar on the National Highway.
At around 8 pm, Anand Pandey reached the hotel and ordered food.
When the food was delayed, he started abusing, assaulting and firing.
Anand was under the influence of alcohol and threatened to kill the hotel staff.
The hotel is located near Bhiti village and is adjacent to Bhadohi district, the inspector said.
Cochrane's accustomed lawyer who gave secret information about the police investigation to Mr. Big, jailed
42-year-old Basharat Ditta used to inform the notorious criminal Neil Scarborough
The lawyer felt that people could find out about his secret drug addiction
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
The top defence lawyer, who told Mr Big about the main police investigation, because he feared people would find out about his secret drug addiction, has been jailed for three years.
Barashat Ditta, 42, after compromising his cocaine addiction, provided the notorious criminal Neil Scarborough with sensitive confidential information about his drug trafficking activities.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and hailed as "Top Brief" by the criminals, was arrested from his home in 2011 after police surveillance operations in Scarborough, which he represented at the previous Narcotics Trials.
Authorities had seen the 32-year-old Scarborough holding three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out for a law society dinner with his colleagues.
Investigations into Ditta's hair, his wallet, and cocaine particles found in his credit card revealed that Ditta was a "regular user" of Class A drugs.
During the eight-month period between January and August 2011, he illegally sought information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored by police at the time as part of the main investigation into the heroin and cocaine gang operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Among them were 32 others, who were jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds and more than 200,000 pounds in cash during multiple raids.
The 42-year-old Datta used to provide information to criminals, because he feared that people would not know about his cocaine addiction.
Detta, who works at law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was today facing failure at Liverpool Crown Court after being found guilty in two cases of obstructing the course of justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted about keeping cocaine at an earlier hearing.
The lawyer's bad time began when while examining Scarborough, police found that he had been in regular contact with Datta over the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives chased the suspect and found him coming into Ditta's house and carrying a drug of over 60 per cent purity under the lawyer's bin in the Black Golf Glove.
Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta, who had gone out for dinner at the Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park, after the drug was placed.
On reaching home, the lawyer came to know that the drug was kept there and they had talked nine times.
The court heard that Datta was found to be a "regular user" of cocaine in the trial when he was found to have A class of narcotic drugs on his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to use cocaine and said he was talking to a suspected dealer because he was his client and that their discussion was a matter of "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Datta attempted to remove several credit cards by taking out his wallet, but they were seized, and his hair sample was taken.
In a police interview, he said that he used to run his office from his workplace as well as his home, and his clients used to call him at his home for legal matters.
After the main arrested persons told what the detectives knew about them, the court heard that Datta used to make phone calls to key people in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had earlier presented the case.
Annie White, on behalf of the prosecution, stated that: “The criminal advocate should be best aware of not breaking the law.”
Mr. Datta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal advocate, engaging too much with his specific client.
We are not talking about the normal drug dealer relationship, but about a dealer who is providing drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations must have been legal, without a doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went far beyond the limits of his lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible so that they would be able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Datta was not respecting his profession, but insulting.
He drew much closer to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed himself to compromise with his freedom.
Datta denied any wrongdoing and claimed: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, but I would have done it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstad of Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Datta converted himself from a criminal lawyer to a criminal when he started receiving drugs from organized criminals."
Due to his cocaine addiction, he became overly compromised and very vulnerable to the motives of the leading members of organized crime groups, who used him to obtain important information related to police investigations.
Advocates must maintain the highest standard of integrity, and instill confidence and confidence in the people.
Mr. Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to escape the garb of his profession.
Mr. Datta was examined by the Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire, which also found him guilty of three counts of possession of cocaine and now obstructing the course of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bringing the perpetrators to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and present you before the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison for conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other members of the gang were sent to prison for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On her website, Datta gave a question and answer session in which she said her fantasy job would be to be a lawyer for a client with the death penalty in the US, Muhammad Ali being her dinner guest, and inequality being the inspiration for her work.
Kenya's press is outraged over the controversial media law
The newspaper challenged the bill as unconstitutional, saying that "this is a frightening place, and it is legitimate to ask: What is there to prevent Parliament from taking away the independence of the judiciary in the future?"
"This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it,"" said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group - Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and news website CapitalFM."
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it is part of the government" and that banning content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send the MP back," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will give the government "strict control over the media", while The Standard said democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "have suffered a severe blow" and described the bill as cruel.
The bill is being passed as part of measures to strengthen national security after an Islamic gunman attacked a Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenyan media broadcast security camera footage of the squads sent to the site of the attack, showing them purposefully robbing the mall, which angered authorities with Kenyan media.
Police chief David Kimyo had summoned two journalists and a mediaperson for questioning, though the summons was withdrawn after a media furore.
Under the new bill, media companies can be fined 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists a million Kenyan shillings, and there is an additional risk of being "removed from the list" or not being recognized by the official press.
The tribunal also has the power to confiscate the property of the violators if the penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "One penalty is enough to shake the foundation of most FM stations."
It also said that these measures could have devastating effects on what is described as Kenya's "living blogosphere."
By shutting down the media, politicians know they can do their own arbitrariness.
Nation journalist Mutuma Mathew describes the Kenyan media as a major source of control and balance in public life, writing "no one will ever know."
"Leave it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and bring us back to the age of poaching and hoarding," he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have faced the wrath of the people in the past.
In May, he voted in favor of rejecting the cuts ordered by the National Pay Commission, and restoring about 532,000 shillings a month, tax-free body pay, considered one of the highest in the world.
New Delhi Jagran Entertainment Desk: Mukesh Ambani's wife Nita Ambani, the richest Indian in the world, is celebrating her birthday on November 1, but as soon as the clocks rang twelve on the night of October 30, the entire Jodhpur began to reverberate with Nita Ambani's birthday.
Earlier, the atmosphere of celebration was completely created by the performance of AR Rahman's team.
Rahman performed his signature songs at the musical night, which began at 8 pm.
Priyanka Chopra was on the stage for the dance floor.
As many as 32 charterers arrived in Jodhpur to attend Nita Ambani's birthday celebrations.
Due to reduced parking space at Jodhpur Airport, the charter was parked in Jaipur, Delhi, Udaipur and Jodhpur.
Similarly, 135 luxury cars, including BMW and Juggernaut, were ordered.
Sood said that the sanitation system in the city, street lights have completely failed.
No steps are being taken by the Municipal Corporation and HUDA to run the city centre of Panchkula.
He has demanded complete removal of Panchkula from his house.
Addressing a press conference here on Friday, VK Sood said after the municipal elections, the city has got a new councillor and mayor, but they do not have the power to get the work done.
The city has become a dumping ground and officials are working on their own accord.
Sood said the civic body has crores of rupees, but all the money is being collected by depositing it in banks as FDs.
But no steps have been taken to put the money on the development of the city.
VK Sood said that the problem of dumping ground is the most serious.
The construction of a dumping ground in Sector 23 has forced the residents of Ghaggar across sectors to live a hell of a life for the past several years.
Municipal officials have been talking about shifting the dumping ground in village Jhuriwala for the last several years, but people in the Barwala area are already suffering from the serious problem of flies.
He said that the condition of health services and education system in the villages has deteriorated completely.
Till date, no work has been started to provide facilities to the people in rural areas.
UN sets new targets to tackle poverty
The United Nations is set to immediately begin work on a new set of goals that will replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to combat global poverty.
To replace the MDDs that were due to expire in 2015, the Australian diplomat played a key role in advancing the "Sustainable Development Goals" just before the Sustainable Development Summit, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro.
These were included in the final draft of the document, which will be supported by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the night summit that it was time to "rise above national interests."
“I am very happy that Member States have agreed to initiate and take ownership of the process to establish the Universal Sustainable Development Goals,” he said.
These SDGs will be based on our development within the Millennium Development Goals, and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will make every effort to implement the mandate given to me by our Member States to meet our far reaching objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals based on the success of the MDGs.
Mozambique’s security concerns grow as powerful figures clash
Thousands of people gathered in central Maputo, with a statue of Mozambique's founding president Samora staring down on them, for a rare public demonstration in a slogan of peace.
"We want peace back, we want stability," said Vanessa de Susa, chief executive of an investment company.
Frightened about the future of her country, she changed her corporate dress from a Portuguese T-shirt printed "We demand security" and joined the crowd at the capital Independence Square on Thursday.
Clashes between government forces and Rey Namo have been reported almost daily for two weeks, since more than 20 years before a peace deal.
Re Namo was once a notorious rebel of the movement supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country 's independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to return to full-blown conflict, but recent events have emboldened foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy that could bring some of the companies including Rio Tinto, Brazil’s Well, Eni, to investments of more than $50bn next year.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Ray Namo blame each other for the tensions.
Ray Namo says the government began the latest conflict on October 17 by launching attacks on its members in Sofa La province, a traditional Re Namo stronghold
Attacks on former rebels and then on the rise led government forces to attack Renmo targets and attempt to kill Affonso Dhaka Ma, the group's leader, Fernando Mazang, a spokesman for Re Namo, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Re Namo for triggering the confrontation, accusing him of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Jibuzhin has called for de-escalation of concerns about instability.
Mr. Jibuzan told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakama had seen himself as a "loser" "whoever it is remains to try to prove to his forces that he can enforce his own decision on the government."
Both Free Limo and Ray Namo insist they want to avoid war.
Mr Mazang was quoted as saying that the 1992 peace deal was cancelled by Re Namo but has since become a matter of concern again.
He told FT that means that the agreement is not being honoured by Free Limo
Our vision is to return to negotiations, but seriously," Mr Mazang said.
The last talks between the two sides did nothing to ease tensions in a series of conflicts this year.
"It's about the two big guys (Jibuzan and Dhakama) fighting together," said Yusuf Han, a lecturer at the London Open University and a Mozambique expert.
Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are willing to make the kind of concessions that are required.
Ray Namo, who has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already spoken out about the boycott of municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted their use of force as an attempt to win over concessions and economic loot from the government.
Rey Namo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a new party, a former Rey Namo member, is expected to improve its performance in the elections, including the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM).
Mr Mazang says Mr Jibuzhanko - who is stepping down at the end of his second term next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want to give up the presidency because he doesn't want peace, he doesn't want transparent elections," Mr Mazang said.
What kind of capacity Ray Namo has is not clear, but it has been the disruptive hit-and-run visits at police stations and vehicles on a major North South highway.
Most of the clashes are in the province of Sofa, several hundred kilometers north of Zomaputo, with the host Beira port that relies on miners, including Rio Tinto and the Valley, to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended its experiment for nearly a week after threatening to attack the Re Namo line.
Whether Ray Namo would be able to repeat this threat was Mr. Mazangvinit almost on being asked.
"Things weren't going well in Mozambique that wanted to warn the international community," Mr Mazang said.
The government of instability exacerbated the frustrations, says Fernando Lima, the media cop, who heads an independent media company, many are also concerned about corruption, slow growth and recent floods of kidnappings.
"The people responsible for the country's future are the government and the president, and he must be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
Omar Sultanate, an exponent, people still need stability.
"Nobody cares about Ray Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to roads," he said.
Children should be taught "as models for a way of life", myths and legends.
Thor's stories could show "there is no match for subtle moves in brute strength," while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
To teach many of the myths would also be "exceptional far-flung wild and in some cases even vulgar and in schools it would not be appropriate to be taught," Cross Lee Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age appropriate works.
"I find it amazing that, in America, myth and folklore are already a part of education," he said.
I've been advocating this as a plan for twenty years.
He has called writers and teachers "more insightful" and it is "a new turn" for children, with messages being "presented" in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and wrote the Penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folk tales, said: “You may have a lot of intentions but it would be better to keep it out of sight.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult writer writing for a child and an adult writer writing for an adult requires some sense of hope.
Everything has to be simplified or come to a happy end, but it is an instinctive sense of good and evil.
And that should be submitted, rather than told through a story revealed.
It doesn't show the old base.
Ghumarwin: Head constable Om Prakash retired from the police department in Ghumarwin after serving for 32 years.
Officers and employees of the police department were present on the occasion.
Om Prakash is a resident of village Bhapral of Gram Panchayat Bani Bhapral.
He provided better services during his tenure.
Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
People may argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago comedian Frank Fey, who served as the ceremony’s master at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began telling jokes directly to people in the crowd in a conversational way.
Fae's search has expanded over the years, most recently, at the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival, created and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Standup Institute called Carolines, celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headliners appeared in the Carolines, and became huge successes, to a level where they became too big to play at the club," says Hirsch.
We created this celebration as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes, the presence of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual musical and comedy benefit for military retirees at Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes" which featured artists including Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
A lot of comedians participating in this year's festival have come through non-traditional mediums, such as shows coming on smaller networks such as Comedy Central, FX, and Spike.
Nick Crawley rose to prominence with the deep-cable sitcom (fx.x.x's hilariously Ronchi Fantasy-football theme "The League"), and now has his own comedy central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", though she is best known for her viral video series "Marshall the Shell with Shoes On."
Other different-sounding young comedians, including Crawley and Slate, (anthony Jeselnik, satirical, ethnically focused W. Kamau Bell) are products of the decentralised world of American comedy.
Among the most highlights of the celebration will be, an interview with: David Steinberg's talking to Larry David:
Steinberg began working as a standup comedian, but he has become a renowned television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted the show "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall, in the heart of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry’s works,” Steinberg said.
He was telling me that when he was here, sometimes he would go to the street between the two buildings and think to himself that if I ever lost all my money, I would stay here.
Oil continues to decline towards $96 a barrel
The drop in oil prices continued on Friday as a report offsets concerns about oversupply, where power-hungry construction sector in China is getting stronger.
The benchmark for December delivery was US crude down 14 cents at $96.24 a barrel by late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract has fallen 5.8 percent for the month of October, dropping 39 cents on Thursday.
Adequate supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, the supply has increased by more than 25 lakh barrels.
But a rise in activity suggested strong demand showed that two reports on Chinese manufacturing came on Friday.
This suggests that growth could continue to strengthen China's economic recovery after a two-decade low tied at 7.8 percent in the third quarter.
Brent crude also fell 26 cents from $108.58 per barrel on the ICE exchange in London, a benchmark for international crude used by U.S. refineries.
The court has blocked action on the New York Police Department's pause and sports policy.
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked changes requiring a judge's order for the New York Police Department's pause and play program and removed the judge from the case.
Judge Shira Schindler of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 2 & 3 said the judge will decide pending the outcome of an appeal by the city.
The judge in the city had ruled in August that it violated the Constitution in a way that prevented people from being stopped and excluded from its programme of questioning.
The city’s police department has appealed its findings and its remedial order, including the decision to allocate a monitor to help change its policy and the training program associated with it.
The appeals court heard arguments on the request on Tuesday.
The court of appeal has said that because he compromised the requirement for a judge to avoid the appearance of bias in a series of media interviews and because the public has misconstrued the Code of Conduct for US judges, the judge's case should be removed from the public record to criticize the court of statements.
The judge had ruled that the police officers violated the civil rights of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men with its pauses and sporting events.
It has appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including economic reforms in policies, training and supervision, and has ordered a pilot program to test body worn cameras on some campuses where most are closed.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of those whose cases were dismissed after a police crackdown.
An oral argument on Nagar's appeal is scheduled for sometime after March 14, 2014.
The pause and play device has been criticized with civil rights advocates.
The pause and play policy has been around for decades in some form, but mostly from black and Hispanic men, 684330 has been recorded to be an all-time high from 2011 under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg to dramatically halts growth.
A lawsuit was filed by four men from all minorities in 2004 and became a class action case.
Supporters of the NYPD’s pause and change to the sports program have said that the end of inappropriate behavior will result in a more reliable and effective police force to be molded and may affect other police department policy-making.
Opponents say the change will reduce police morale, but will solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after crime, money wasted and not shrinking by thousands of officers during the last decade.
The judge noted that the pause and termination was not for the sport, which is constitutional, but had improved the implementation of the NYPD's Stop.
A large number of participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts participated in the training.
During the seven-day period, all the participants were given information about various disciplines including tent pitching, flag pole.
The training is being carried out in collaboration with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
All the participants are spreading the spirit of unity by joining in the Sarvadharma prayer.
Camp Principal Vipin Kumar is giving his special support to the State Training Commissioner.
Coulson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
Andy Coulson, a former editor of News of the World, has been accused of using "phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face" in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about Charles Clarke's relationship while he was the home secretary.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis QC told the Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clark was dating her "attractive special counsel" Hannah Pollby.
The court said the newspaper hired private investigator Glenn Mulcair to hack Pollby's voicemail and "monitor" the male, but Colson also called and left his voicemail.
Mr. Addis added that "the prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of the NOTW, is not known to stand outside people's houses and watch them, but he puts articles in front of people, to see how people react to it."
He said that the NOTW used three methods to investigate cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face.
The third group consisted of the editors themselves.
He knew the other way around, and he knew the other way around.
What about the first one?
Did he know about the phone hacking?
He says, “No, we have to say, “Yes, he knew exactly.”
The rumor about Clark's romance affair was first introduced by the AOTW's feature desk when a source sexually inclined to Ms. Paulby said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
From home in Mulcare in August 2006, the tape of voicemail was seized at least three times from Ms. Paulby's phone.
Investigators also found entries on the personal investigator's computer that gave Ms. Paulby and her sister the name "Project".
During the period in which she was being examined, Ms. Paulby's grandparents used to call anonymously and ask for information about her.
During the visit, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup witnessed Ms. Paulby’s movements.
On June 18, 2005, through a voicemail to him, Colson told him: "I've got a story that we're planning to run tomorrow, which I would definitely like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Addis said Colson's involvement in the case is in parsons with other important people, such as former Home Secretary David Blanket.
The bench heard on Thursday that Colson had spoken to Mr Blanket about his love affair with a married woman while he was looking into the case of co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Colson and Brooks refused to have sexual intercourse with others to hack phones between October 3, 2006 and August 9, 2006.
Mulker, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to hacking the phone.
The NSA's disclosures about state surveillance have fuelled corporate fears.
Late on a quiet day in August, a German police helicopter hovered over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
At the direction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to photograph the roof of the US outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
German media asked BfV to express hope to identify the presence of the Lisning antenna and signal an exchange action between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin..
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, stressed that the U.S. should not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "steal foreign companies' trade secrets and allow U.S. companies to increase their international competitiveness or down the line" again in September.
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has become a whistleblower, began to tell the U.S. surveillance its treasure trove of secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure that the director is not going to keep his word.
The U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers including Google and Yahoo and Yahoo expressed fears about state surveillance.
The last thing came when it was discovered that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged, possibly a decade ago.
If Europe’s most powerful individuals can be targeted, surely business leaders are also targeting potential.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between American intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible that these data be used for mutual benefit.
“Germany should wake up,” says Oliver Gr<0xC3><0xBC>n, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
German companies believe, according to a survey published in July by the consultancy, that the U.S. is almost now at greater risk when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, like China.
In all the documentation leaked by Mr. Snowden, however, there is no evidence to date that the U.S. went to the trade secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the lack of internet capabilities of the EU. And it should make efforts to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are suspicious of this.
Someone in the German parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
Haso Platner, president of the German business software company SAP, said "It's no way."
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, then they didn’t have to let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
Snowden's revelations about U.S. technological sophistication and spying access have proved to be a shock to some companies that previously believed the biggest surveillance threat was China
A major shift is taking place in the cloud computing space where European officials are more aware that data stored in the U.S. is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore have become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, some 10 per cent of non-U.S. members canceled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after revelations about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, co-CEO of SAP says: “We saw a new question that customers didn’t come across a year ago – is that –my data is stored called? And can you guarantee that it will physically remain in that jurisdiction?”
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are just confirming what they already knew: that the powerful state wants to steal their most prized secrets and data and therefore must guard these at all costs.
That economic espionage happens is not a surprise.
It has always been so.
“This has been a topic for many years, and through fundamental current discussion, nothing has changed,” says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF.
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial levels, and so do we, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in defense mechanisms and this is an advantage for the attacker.
For large companies, it’s unwise to leave a message recording for a long time whether in business from home by carrying a usb stick, or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is unwise to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of car manufacturer Audi, says that this is a year-old system of collecting mobile phones before board meetings because they cannot be used as remote listening devices.
Germany’s BfV executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when that smart phones are compromised due to risks on foreign trips.
Pre-paid mobile phones were later thrown away.
However, small and medium companies are in danger of hacking and monitoring it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, this many companies top the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access," warns BfV in a report.
The U.S. has warned other countries about economic espionage of their own companies.
In February, the US national intelligence was named in a second tier of hackers linked to hacking for economic intelligence behind Russia and Israel, according to the Washington Post.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company, when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squareini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, explains in the interview: “The services are well aware that all countries, even if they cooperate in non-terrorist combat, spy on their allies.”
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial levels, and so do we, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
No one is stupid.
The parents of a Georgia teenager who was killed in a ‘unique accident’ believe his son was murdered
A teenager from Georgia whose body was found wrapped in a restroom mat at his high school gym believes his son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, GA was found trapped inside his high school gym on January 11 in a mat standing directly behind the bleachers.
Investigators at the Landes County Sheriff's Office concluded that Johnson had died in an "unusual accident", but the family of the 17-year-old boy denied it.
Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that he "fully believes that his son has been murdered."
He does not believe in death in the manner described by the sheriff.
Crump said that "he believes that this is beyond the physical laws and logic of normal intelligence."
They feel that this conclusion, is an excuse for the safety of the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
"He sent his son to school with a book-back, and he returned in a body bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney General Michael Mulray said on Thursday he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that many important questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his murder a crime?
Murray said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, wherever they take us.
My aim is to bring out the truth.
“I am of the view that environmental reasons exist for a formal investigation,” he said.
Moore told the reporter that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson died as a result of "status quo."
According to Moore, a second autopsy, by the way, revealed a different cause of death."
"There are so many questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore also said he would ask the FBI to do so if he found enough evidence to summon a criminal or investigate civil rights in the case of Johnson's death.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative was not immediately available for comment from the Laundry County Sheriff's Office.
On Wednesday, a judge in southern Georgia ordered authorities to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope video footage will give some indication of how he died.
CDC issues Allergy Guidelines for Children for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to control food allergies of children in the school.
Such guidelines have been issued for the first time by the U.S. government, as the number of school-going children suffering from food allergies is on the rise.
Now one in every 20 children in the U.S. has a food allergy.
The CDC found that there was an 18 percent increase in food allergy cases among children between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about food allergies in children, and how to handle them in the event of an allergic reaction.
Schools have also been suggested to stock up on epinephrine to combat potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis – the auto-injector of the Epinephrine brand that is most commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, allowing schools to easily keep stock of epinephrine in large quantities.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms to be transmitted by children suffering from an allergic reaction.
Children may say "it feels like something is pricking in my tongue," "it feels like I have hair on my tongue", or "it's tingling in my tongue."
Parents of Intersex Kids Can Choose Their Children’s ‘Gender Undetermined’
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognise a third gender for babies born with unclear genitals.
Now newborn babies will not be assigned male or female in a conventional way.
The new law does not require parents to declare gender for such children, allowing them to declare gender ‘unspecified’ or ‘unspecified’ on the child’s birth certificate.
The new law aims to reduce pressure on parents who can make hasty decisions regarding gender-specific surgery for newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex children.
According to the BBC, an intersex man said years later, "Neither am I a man nor a woman."
I will continue to be a wounded, stained prisoner made by the doctors.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children is a child who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that come under the scrutiny of sexual development disorders, a collective term used for abnormal chromosomes, genitals (ovaries or testicles), or abnormally developed sex.
It may be that Wallis Simpson has been intersex.
Gender identity is still not properly understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to specify gender and observe the child's psychological and physical development before undergoing surgery, if such an event occurs.
New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-identity matters, said Germany’s new law “appears to be a good thing.”
Intersex children create moral confusion.
“Some people are in a life-threatening situation that requires surgery, but that’s not the case with most children,” he said.
You can specify the gender without surgery, and then see how the identity develops.
The science of how a penis will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No one can give a proper answer as to why this happens.
It’s kind of a puzzle as to why people are gay.
The report, filed with the European Commission in 2011, described intersex people as different from transsexuals or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related but is related to their biological makeup, which is neither clearly male nor female, but is either a joint of the two or neither is clearly defined.
These characteristics may manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breast and length; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals; or in chromosomal structures and hormones.
The report provides an overview of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender individuals in the workplace, as well as harassment, violence and discrimination crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-conforming genders.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adult individuals to mark a male, female or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the world's first recognized "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal to keep "unspecified" sex status for life.
According to the Interior Ministry, in addition to M or F in the German passport, there will also be a third specification as X for intersex persons.
According to news reports on France 24, issues related to gender in neighbouring France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French law-makers from this strictly Catholic country signed a petition to withdraw "gender theory" from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online also opposed the German law, saying, “While the world is moving to a state where gender is a self-selected choice, not sexual activity, we are moving two more pillars of civilization in the opposite direction.”
The mother of a newborn in Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would love to see the babies assigned gender at birth.
She said on the website about the upbringing, "Without additional limitations, upbringing is very stressful, especially if you don't even know what the gender of your child is."
Children need stability and security.
Historically, babies born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites (bisexuals), named after the handsome Greek god who was bisexual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world treated gender as a slate that could be erased and then written down.
But now that many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they are realizing that gender-identification is complicated work, and can sometimes be mistaken by physicians who don’t know what children will feel about their gender specification when they grow up.
Drescher says that in the mid-20th century, it was called a "psychological emergency."
When these babies were born, you didn’t call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The current theory about the treatment of children with unclear genitals was presented by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who considered the penis to be sacrosanct.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that social and environmental cues – how parents raise a child – interact with the baby’s genes and hormones to determine whether to identify him as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as “John/Joan,” his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child, whose penis had accidentally splayed during the lingagracharma (circumcision), to tie the child completely and remove her testicles and take care of her like a girl.
“Money presented that case as a successful case of transition, but that didn’t happen,” Drescher said.
At the age of 15, the child changed back into a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, she committed suicide.
Drescher said there are still some physicians "following the same pattern."
But with the advent of the Internet in the years after 1990, individuals undergoing these gender surgeries began to come out "not happy with the result."
A similar case was with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with the XY male chromosome, but his genitalia was unclear.
The physicians did not clearly understand that his penis was small, or that his clitoris was large, but they were certain that he could never live a “satisfied life” as a man.
Therefore, shortly after her birth in 1976, Bruce 's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and brought up as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At the age of 18, she was about to have vaginoplasty with him.
But feeling depressed and somewhat disturbed, he sought medical records.
This revealed the terrible truth to him.
I was bonded at birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone, which prevented his genitals from developing properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, took testosterone supplements and removed his breasts.
Due to surgery, he became infertile.
Today, he explains to people to normalize their perception of intersex individuals in an organization called the Interface Project.
But Annie Tamer-Mattis, executive director of California-based legal group Advocates for Informationd Choice, expresses concern that Germany's law "invites silence and stigma."
“Many activists think that Germany’s law will prompt parents to make quick decisions and specify the child “undetermined,” she says.
We are afraid that this will encourage interference.
We think that instead of waiting, specifying the male or female gender is a better process.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only speculate.
Tamer-Mattis said his organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to be identified in a third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender,” he said.
The law of Germany is concerned with specifying it at the time of birth.
This is not a war fought by newborns at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their bodies.
But the Pittsburgh-based breast radiologist, Dr Erlene Baratz, whose daughter has a sexual development disorder, and who assists hundreds of others in the support group, said Germany's law would "give strength" to both parents and children.
Baratzi's daughter Katy was born with male chromosomes, but had a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Since her androgen receptor was defective, female traits developed in Katy.
He has a vagina in his body but no uterus or ovarian.
Now 29-year-old Katy is married and a resident of the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a mother through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"This law allows parents not to make hasty decisions on their own," Bartze said.
It provides them with proper understanding and time by some trial before writing ‘male’ or ‘female’.
In this way, you stay well - raise the child, love the child.
You have a sweet baby and have fun with it.
We don't have to rush to get a surgery that can't be done back.
“It brings children into the decision-making process and frees parents from the anxiety that motivates them because they don’t believe they are doing well,” he said.
Ultimately, the child will determine which sex she is more comfortable with—and that would be a great thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.
The legal awareness camp was organised by the Tehsil Legal Services Committee, Ramnagar, under the chairmanship of Ramnagar Sub-Judge Sandeep Kaur.
Students and others were given information about the right to education and the law for economically backward people.
Advocates M L Gupta, Rohin Bhardwaj and Sarpanch sensitized the people while speaking on the subject at the camp.
A large number of villagers were present on the occasion.
Report: Consider the Biden-Dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, close advisers to President Barack Obama secretly considered Hillary Clinton as Biden's replacement for the vice presidential ticket for 2012.
The most notable blast in the revelation is the heavily anticipated 2012 campaign Tom by Mark Halperin and John Hellemann, "Double Down: Change the Game 2012."
The Times obtained a copy of the upcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the president's top advisers held "extensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011" to learn what dumping could help Biden in the falling hopes of Obama's re-election.
According to the Times National Political Correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book tells the full story of the chief executives' efforts to campaign and the White House, the former White House staff chief of staff to name the bill, to find out how former state secretary Clinton's change from vice president affects the poll.
The potential switch was a very secure secret within the Chicago Campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisors to the president — including D<0xC3><0xA9>j<0xC3><0xA0> vu, former Obama campaign chief Jim Massina, and former White House senior advisers David Oxlade and David Palouufe — knew the change was under consideration.
"Double Down" claims that Dale tried to replace Biden despite his personal rapport before finally making a decision when his information revealed that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's situation.
In an interview with Martin, Daley has confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Clinton with Biden.
"I said the whole scene was eye-opening, and one of them, this was it," Dale told the newspaper.
You remember, when the presidency was in danger at the time, we were in a situation like, "Holy Christ, what else are we going to do?"
While Daley described the research as a "precaution," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made significant investments in finding out how much of the dividend it would claim if polled.
“The campaign doesn’t spend on voting and focused groups like money unless they’re seriously considering something,” Martin said on the AC360.
It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked Dole if his boss knew about the possible reshuffle.
While Daley said he "didn't think the president was aware of the potential change", the former chief of staff admitted it was "possible" that Obama knew.
"Double Down" sure: won't answer whether the political investigation reached Obama's desk? Martin further explained.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama was not aware of the Biden dumping ticket research.
"Probably," said Martin.
Glow-in-the-dark ice cream do you like it?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken great advantage of the sea animal to develop the best breakfast.
She came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to use chemical luster to re-glaze proteins.
Ice cream will increase the pH level of the protein by reacting with the tongue of the eater and the ice cream will glow.
Chris says that ice cream is ignited by the heat of the mouth, meaning that the more licks to win, the more it will ignite.
Charlie, founder of the Lick Me I'm Delicious Ice Cream Company, said: "It's incredible, but I'm going to get about 2 grams of stuff from the <0xC2><0xA3>200 I'm producing in the early days."
The protein we are using in ice cream will react with neutral pH in the tongue.
As the mouth warms up the protein will increase the pH level and the ice cream will glow.
We've been testing for the past few months and it feels perfect to share on Halloween because it gives amazing glow effects.
This will probably be the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made because jellyfish’s glow is four times more expensive than gold.
So the cost of each scoop comes to me around 140 pounds.
Ikea is very good.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual taste, including beer, cheese, meat, and gold leaf.
But his next composition is going to be even more ambitious.
He said: “I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is inherently impossible because of the ice crystals that make up the refraction on ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream is the utility of fluorescence properties of a jellyfish, which has been synthesized by Chinese scientists.
The entire market was flooded with customers at Rani Bagh market.
Recently, people had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to buy utensils.
The same situation was witnessed in Wazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market and Prashant Vihar Central Market.
Similar scenes were witnessed at the bullion shops in Pitampura, Ashok Vihar and Model Town.
People also bought gold, silver and other precious metals.
Due to this, other markets, including outer ring road, remained closed.
However, those who left the office had to spend hours in jams to reach home.
Halloween 2013: By the Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and play dress-up for the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more than a fan.
I didn’t even sign in to give candy out of my apartment for the last two years and probably won’t this year.
But statistics show that there is a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually celebrating Halloween with $158 million this year, spending $6.9 billion on candy and costumes and decorations.
One of the things I've always wanted to see is the Halloween costumes.
According to the NRF, the total cost of the dress is estimated to be $1.2 billion out of $6.9 billion.
This year's theme is Angry Birds.
Women do not have to be prostitutes; because they are sexy food like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.
For the men, I hope that a lot of zombies, and thanks to Dead Space, will make our Instagram feeds for men this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes will be zombies, Batman, robbers and witches.
I don't think there is anything wrong with being traditional.
Last year we dressed the dog and surprisingly we were not alone.
According to the NRF, Americans will literally spend $330 million on pet clothing.
It's worth noting that there are a lot of hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't look around.
According to the Nielsen company, Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year.
Hairstylist Bars, Lollipops, Milk Dads, Twizzlers and Clark Bars are around 600 million pounds.
According to the US Department of Commerce, it is good news that 41 million tricks and tricks are going to be part of our neighborhood.
But in reality, we're going to buy 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
According to the Confectioners Association, one of the things we will not use during Halloween is candycorn, but that too will sell for about 35 million pounds.
That's about 9 billion of Mecca's individual kernels.
It's a mystery. So far to solve
There's nothing more magical about Halloween than haunted houses.
They had the best names, "Terror behind the wall (which, in fact, is a prison), "scream-o-cheek" and "House of Shock."
According to American power, in fact, there are 1200 officially approved ghost houses in the United States that generate 500 million revenue. And those terrible good pictures that your friend puts on Facebook and the man who likes and comments on you are nice faces.
Finally, let's talk about Kabuto.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and a jack-o-lantern carving is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.
Luckily for us, the "Baby in a Pumpkin trend" began last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these guards and not living with them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year, the U.S. will spend on pumpkins, around $106 million.
Jack-o-lanterns on his front porch probably from Illinois, which grew from 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you’re looking for additional loans, try to engrave their 2,032 pounds of pumpkin on the phone Tim and Susan Matsuda in Napa, Calif., and above.
"""It has been decided to issue a postage stamp containing Sachin's photograph during the pre-match presentation,"" the MCA said in a statement."
This will be followed by a joint presentation by BCCI and MCA.
Apart from this, a special coin will be used for the toss, which will be handled by MCA.
The MCA will also release a 64-page brochure containing articles related to Tendulkar and statements from people from the business, sports and journalist world about him.
The limited number of brochures and coins will be distributed to members of the MCA and BCCI, the association said.
He said 10,000 masks, 10,000 score cards and 10,000 caps will be distributed every day with Sachin's photographs.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
It has racing seats and six-point harness belts in the interior, as well as an intercom system.
Its options include upgraded brakes, service packages that provide access to baller works mechanics, logistic support, and vehicle collection between events.
Drew Baller, managing director of Baller Motorsport, said: "The rally customers who come to the baller have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people looking for a path that leads to excitement and adventure and world-class events.
We are very pleased to offer this route in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format provides a new way to experience different rally modes in the UK and abroad, and prepares the competitor for the rigor and truth of the rally rod.
We've really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car - it'll be a really fun championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenger will offer training and testing days in February, as well as the option to compete in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
The dream of the firecracker traders to do business in the firecracker market located in the transport area did not come true.
The firecrackers traders are trapped in the mezzadar after the High Court order.
Neither can they now do business in the temporary firecracker market at Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued licences for business in the transport area.
The Commission constituted by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, during its visit, declared the temporary firecracker market at Ranjit Avenue as unsafe.
He also imposed a fine of Rs 10 lakh on the Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar for not making proper arrangements there.
In its order, the High Court has severely reprimanded the Amritsar administration for not being able to solve a single problem of firecracker traders for nine years.
They could not find a suitable place in the city.
After this, the firecracker traders were asked to issue licences for the business in the market located at Shipgadh by making proper security arrangements.
Even though the firecrackers traders were happy after this order, but on their happiness, the police turned the water down on Friday.
A police team from Asalha License Branch reached the firecracker market and put up a counter there and sold the farm.
It was impossible to fulfill the conditions they were told after that in one day.
ACP East Gaurav Garg, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma, in-charge of Asalha license branch Anoop Kumar and others reached the firecracker market.
He expressed dissatisfaction over the arrangements made by the firecrackers traders.
Therefore, licences were not issued to firecrackers traders.
Diwali is just a day away.
Due to this, the traders are facing a lot of trouble.
They are losing crores of rupees.
Firecracker traders Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni say they will stake a claim on the district administration if they suffer a loss of crores of rupees.
Angry firecrackers traders took out a protest march from Shipgarh to Ranjit Avenue on Friday night.
They raised slogans against the police and the district administration.
After this, the business was also closed in the temporary firecracker market running on Ranjit Avenue.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy at the mouth of a distressing mountain 50 feet above the ground in a mine
Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after being hit by a small road.
He was spotted by a dog walker trapped in the mine three days later
Firefighters lowered the front part of the rock from the rope to protect the dog from the mouth of death.
After Poppy somehow got stuck at the mouth of a perilous mountain 50 feet above the ground, the call of firefighters gave her a lucky life.
Nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after being hit by a road collision on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
Their owner, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were in the Flappit mine in western Yorkshire to meet Ruby again, and have blessed the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After he ran away after a small accident, he searched like crazy for his lost dog, and an appeal was posted on social networking sites.
At 2.15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed dock walker spotted Ruby, on a mountain in a mine at an altitude of 50 feet from the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Clackheton Fire Station rushed to the scene and lowered Ruby down with a rope to save her and used a belly tube to bring her down from the cliff.
Specialist technical rescue officer Andy Clayton said: “She was in a critical situation.
She was in the middle of the front portion of the rock, 50 feet from the top and bottom.
She did not do a single act during the rescue, she remained a stone.
But now he's good.
After that, she was eating a biscuit.
It was a very unusual call for help.
Seeing the dog is incredible.
Special technical rescue officer Peter Law said: "Ruby is fortunately survived."
He was likely to be seriously injured or in an even worse condition.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for examination, where she was found to be good in addition to exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was terrible to see the rescue work."
At first, I couldn’t believe how she got there.
It's amazing to get it back in your hands.
The veterinarian said that if she was very tired and fell down, she would definitely fall down.
The fire brigade did a great job.
What he did was really brave.
We were very pleased with them and they were all excellent.
Mr. Alderson from Kigali also said: "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there."
The fire brigade did a great job.
I can't believe how he got there.
Mick Jagger says Katy Perry didn't hit her when she was 18
During an interview with the Australian radio show this week, Pon Star said he had sung backing vocals for Jaeger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard."
Perry said he had dinner with the senior rocker, and he hit me when I was 18.
"This thing got old, and he treats me well," he said.
The 70-year-old Jaeger's representative said in a statement on Thursday that he "clearly denies ever hitting Katy Perry."
The representative also said: "Possibly Perry is saying about them in another person's misunderstanding."
Perry was one of the singers to come as a guest on Rolling Stone's tour this year.
His new album "Prism" reached the top this week.
George Kerouac: The European Court of Human Rights has ruled out the possibility
Another day, another story of fear of freedom.
This time we are warned that independent Scotland will be required to join as an independent travel zone throughout Europe as a condition of EU membership.
There are stories about the passport control at Barwick and the barbed wire border on Hadrian's walls.
True, the Strathclyde paper described about the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although – predictably – it was not described in the headlines.
Nor did anyone describe how EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules to suit their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer the Schengen area, there will be affordable discounts for continuous non-compliance Brussels in exchange for Brussels actually getting what it wants from Scotland.
So, then, non-story.
And the thing that has been stuck for so long is frozen. The first thing I heard was "freedom means passport control" about 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting point was lost in re-telling this interesting old story.
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to bid for Europe anyway?
Why should London’s Yoke be bought and sold for Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: The great, post-war plan to organize Europe has finally come to a halt.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Teams dedicated to opposing the EU throughout the EU or closing the euro as a common currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany Party - founded just this year - suddenly gained nearly five million votes in the September federal election, effectively ousting the Free Democrats (the equivalent of our own Lib Dems) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build a federal Europe.
But the current economic crisis proved to be radical.
With the strict regulations imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, the constraints imposed on national economies through compliance with the same currency are causing many to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro did not have much role in the excessive budget deficits of national governments - this was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system stabilized the currency exchange rate in favour of German exporters to its members - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, Southern Europe finds itself in a situation with an inherent loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce wages and public expenditure - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
There is a deep European productivity morbidity far beyond the current budget and currency problems.
To provide exemptions to French and German energy firms on consumer spending – as a result of the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels, European industries pay twice for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United Nations.
This is the paralyzing cost loss, which we have already seen in Granmouth.
Even with all the pay freezes in the world, the European petrochemicals industry cannot be saved from being affected by cheap U.S. shale gas.
As a result, there is a feeling of rebellion among the people, especially in France, which was once a major fan of the EU.
After the war, France's top politicians saw the EU as a way to keep Germany in control, and Paris as a way to provide the world with a billing equivalent to that of Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, causing the French economy to stagnate.
Results: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has won the recent by-election, pushing the ruling socialist to third place.
The Front is currently the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can't run on the assumption that the dissolution for the left will automatically benefit the right.
What is Le Pen doing with his newly found fame among French whites, the working class?
The party wants to use the EU elections next year to form an anti-EU, anti-monopoly bloc in the European Parliament.
If, as much as possible, anti-EU parties do well in these elections, this type of faction could affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My point of view is this: soon a confluence of anti-EU and anti-monopoly sentiment in Europe will put an end to the euro.
The euro will not disappear completely, but it will return to a form of "Europe of sovereign nations" supported by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its subsidiary economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will resume their currencies.
I hope that the UK will distance itself from this project in the hope of building closer ties with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all this?
We can choose to remain (necessarily) the territory of Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in a loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
Non-federal nations will find it easier to work together with other like-minded countries in Europe.
Otherwise we should think about maintaining our economic independence while walking the path of Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland - remarkably - has been the most successful anti-economy political campaign in Europe, winning an astonishing majority in 2011 based on opposing (or implementing) the cuts proposed by Labour Chancellor Alastair Darling and then the Tory-Libe Dam coalition.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, because in that case it would have to accept the rules of emancipation imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: growing up early
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls reach puberty at a younger age than white girls of their age.
Physical change does not mean that puberty is near.
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemical can be blamed
Experts believe that obesity can be a cause of outbreaks, puberty at a young age
The case of premature puberty is not as effective in boys
Pat Etheridge, a former CNN reporter, is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter starts developing breast and genital hair at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, paediatric endocrinologist Dr Paul Caplovitz clarified that these early physical changes are common among American girls, reflecting the new trend.
"I spend a lot of time convincing parents that it doesn't generally reflect rapid progress toward full adulthood," says Caplwitz.
The direct signs of development such as the germination of breasts, genital and anal hair and body odor are visible prematurely in girls.
But in the last four decades there has been a very slight change in the age of Rajodarshan (first menstruation-religion).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, up from 12.75 in 1970.
“It takes at least two to three years at first menopause when the breasts begin to develop,” explains Caplovitz, who is also the author of “Prematurity in Girls: The Essential Guide to Dealing with This Common Problem.”
The most accurate test of puberty development is time.
There is debate about what constitutes the onset of puberty, but when there is an increase with breast development before the age of 8, two call it “child-adult.”
In most cases, this process will slow down or stop – which can be closely monitored by a pediatrician.
In the event of more rapid progress, an endocrinologist may need to be examined to rule out the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay premature menstruation and other consequences: premature ageing of the bones, which can lead to undeveloped growth and stunted growth as an adult.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the child's age, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthood.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is aware of the drugs but admits, "Suppression of puberty can raise behavioral issues, and girls may start to feel isolated from their peers."
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don’t want their young daughter to have a menstrual cycle.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or about how they will maintain hygiene," Caplovitz said.
A woman, whose daughter had started menstruating at age 10, recalls, “It was a shock.”
Although there were symptoms and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She returned to her school scared and upset that she was the first to start menstruation among her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
Yet, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexually oriented messages in the media can be blamed.
Boys - just like girls - are getting premature puberty.
Caplovitz sets the rules that the main reason for this is the outbreak of obesity.
She assisted in conducting a study on girls aged 6 to 9 in the year 2001, which combines body fat with puberty.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to get puberty before white girls of their age.
There are many explanations for this.
Globally, the pattern of premature puberty appears to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to weather and genes.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting facial and genital hair at a young age, the trend of full puberty is not as clear as the girls in them.
Other physicians attending the AAP conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to see acne and genital hair.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty,” says Dr. Lawrence Silverman, endocrinologist at Goreeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician to get an opinion on how to talk to their children.
“This could mean having a conversation before the expected time,” advised Caplovitz.
If you are calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who develop prematurely need to be assured that even if it is happening prematurely, it is part of normal life.
On Monday, the minimum temperature was recorded at 3.1 degrees Celsius.
On Wednesday night, the rain and cold air made people feel very cold.
On Sunday, people wore sweaters and headed out to markets and their destinations.
People have also taken out rakhis on the first rains of winter.
In the morning, people were seen enjoying the sun.
As the weather changes, there will also be a lot of relief from cold, etc., but after that due to cloudy sky throughout the day, the sun continued to shine.
The children also went to school wearing sweaters.
According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum temperature was 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.7 degrees Celsius.
The city recorded 7.8 mm of rainfall.
According to the Meteorological Department, the sky will remain cloudy.
Large orders of jet manufacturers from dispute to seat width at stake.
This month's Dubai Arsho has come under fire for setting the tone for fights between leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long-haul flights.
The controversy focuses on the width of the seat of economy class in long-haul flights, not always as given by airlines, but whose allocated space efficiency is claimed to be the key by the latest Jet Airways SAS and Boeing Company.
Airbus is expected to give an extended seat of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the economy cabin this week to such an industry standard, but it should be decided by airlines, its main rival Boeing says.
The dispute between the aircraft manufacturers comes after a possible order placed after the 17-21 incident to sell the large version of the twin engines of the long-range aircraft.
How is the previous section of the aircraft designed- especially if the seating is equal to 9 or 10. Designs of mini jumbo jets are being prepared keeping in view the claims of higher capacity?
Boeing says it has created a "777 X" that will place 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 people in a row in the economic department.
Airbus says that while competing with the A350, it will leave 350 people 18 inches and move them to a 9-seater.
Aircraft majors often strike trade on technical matters through advertising in the business press.
Now, with the Airbus 777 X expected to dominate more than 100 orders in Dubai Arsho, this is further appealing to the public.
Recently, it is being seen that the beginning of the Vigyan war has been anything but a show to the financier that all three of them are in a restaurant together, will you accept this?
Airbus sales head John Lehi said "Boeing is also introducing long-range flights from regional turbos to narrowseats."
In the form of change, people may be getting bigger, but the way the aircraft sits has not changed.
According to data from the U.S. Department of Health, between the 1970s when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined a modern long-haul trip, and at the end of the century, the average 40 - 49 - year - old American male had an increase in weight by 10 percent.
According to U.S. health statistics, the average American male in the 21st century has a waist of 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rival clings to a seat concept from the 1950s when the new name "Jet Set" had an average circumference narrower.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission to suggest an additional 53 per cent increase in the width of the seat to improve the quality of sleep.
Boeing has disputed Airbus' seat measurement data, saying it is not up to the manufacturers' decision on how airlines strike a balance between fares and facilities.
Research shows that the width of a seat depends on the experience of the cabin.
"It really gives airlines flexibility and the things they believe they need to do to be successful," said Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver.
"They don't want to tell us what benefits they have."
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers it’s about elbow room, but for suppliers it’s increasingly an issue that it can affect income.
At least $700 billion worth of trade is estimated to be behind this dispute. The aircraft order competition is enough, in the coming decades, to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports.
Reuters reports that for the first time in July, whether the seat layout is actually an issue of fighting between the new jets.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that their new twin-engine design had a 20% efficiency per seat compared to that segment's leader, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300 Er.
Boeing's performance claims depend on the 777 with 10 x One original 9 compared to the 777 with the 777 design.
The unit cost has now been used in comparison to the 10 par with the profit.
Kevin Keniston, head of Europe’s Airbus passenger facility, says “Boeing’s doing this to make their aircraft more competitive with our products, to occupy more seats”.
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat-per-row cabin for the existing 777 S suggests that many passengers favor the denser layout, which can go with cheap fares as well.
Cabin interiors expert Marie Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network, said, "The 18-inch seat width will be great for passengers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is driven by the threat of a proposal 777."
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list for airlines to choose from.
Jet sellers around the world should also take precautionary measures to check on this layouts competition.
Resting more, all builders are also offering low-cost jet airliners and high-density layouts for regional travel.
Airbus is offering a 10 equivalent A350 but says it hasn't sold it yet.
But until recently, Airbus insisted on wider cabin seats on some of its jets for the need for more cabin facility.
Modern jets are unlikely to fly on a new industry standard without the support of another manufacturer, but it could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine may end the enjoyment of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can eliminate the fun of smoking.
The same dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mice from nicotine addiction for the rest of their lives.
Further testing is needed before human trials can begin, which may take years, but Ronald Crystal, a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said the early signs were positive.
“We very much hope that this type of vaccine strategy can eventually help millions of smokers who have attempted to quit smoking using all the methods available on the market in today’s time, but they found that their addiction to nicotine is far more powerful than these existing methods,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, designed to transmit genetic information aimed at making anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus selectively infects the liver cell, which then begins to form a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood, and prevent the inhalation of nicotine in the smoker by neutralizing them before they reach the brain.
In the trial, vaccinated rats who were later given nicotine continued to perform their normal activities.
The researchers say that but the rat who was not vaccinated "feels good", it was a sign that nicotine had reached his brain.
The study was published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Earlier tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to be administered at regular intervals to maintain the level of antibodies, but it proved costly and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be high, as the liver will make the cell a factory of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe, it can be given to children before the temptation to try cigarettes, so that they can be protected from nicotine addiction.
But it is likely to be used by smokers to quit smoking.
"They will find that if they start smoking again they won't get any pleasure from smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help them get rid of their habit," he said.
British scientists called the results interesting, but warned of the need for much more research.
Even after the post-mortem, the exact cause of the death could not be ascertained.
The forest department is giving a befitting reply to the tigress's death as a natural one.
The body of a tigress was found by forest personnel of Ramnagar forest division near Pawalgarh Conservation Reserve Khichdi drain on Thursday night.
All the organs of the dead body of the tigress were safe as well as there were no wound or injury marks etc. on it.
The post-mortem of the tigress was conducted on Friday in the presence of forest conservator Vivek Pandey, deputy director of CTR Saket Badola, DFO Kahaksha Naseem, SDO GS Karki, veterinary doctor of CTR Bharat and veterinarian of Kotabag Hema Rathore.
According to sources, the internal body of the tigress is said to be damaged during the post-mortem.
The exact cause of the tigers death could not be ascertained.
Departmental officials kept responding to the tigress's death.
However, the internal organs of the tigress have been sent to IVRI Bareilly for topsycological examination to confirm the poison.
Forest conservator of forests Vivek Pandey said the tigress's death could be termed as natural.
No signs of poisoning etc. have been found from the body of the tigress.
However, along with the search of the surrounding area, Bisra is being sent for the confirmation of the poison.
Tripoli denies being influenced by Obaid.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the State Corpusion Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi has refused to repudiate the maritime leases policy at the request of his political mentor, former New South Wales mentor Eddie Obaid, who had hidden interests in the three government-controlled lands.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday detailed its investigation into whether Mr. Obaid had asked several state ministers for a violation of the Lending Lease Policy circulars, where two restaurants and cafes owned by Obaid were renewed without tenders after their expiry in August 2005.
Lin Ashpole, former Deputy Chief of Staff, after the evidence given on Thursday that Mr. Tripodi knew the hidden selfishness of Mr. Obaid? is now being investigated.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressed for the introduction of public tenders for leases.
The lessees were against this and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the enterprise of the circular for leases, from which Obaid earned $25 million a year, was renewed from the tender without a lease.
Mr Tripodi, who was the minister for the dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of public tenders.
But he refused to change at the request of Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripodi had requested for a change in the government lease policy
In August and September 2007, Mr. Obaid and Mr. Tripodi and Mr. Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to Mr. Obaid's Fisheries Department after working in the Ministry of Ports
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheely asked Mr. Tripodi. "What commercial lease policy was being discussed in the development of the case, telephone conversation?"
"No," Mr. Tripodi answered.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obaid.
Officials say Israeli warplanes fired into Syria.
Israeli fighter jets targeted the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administration official confirmed to Fox News.
The officer did not say what the motive was, but there was at least one motive.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian missiles SA-125.
Israel has carried out air strikes on missiles inside Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers on a 457 visa can go through the "authenticity" test
The government is considering a "authenticity" test for foreign employees on a 457 visa, as it aims to expand a rigorous process.
If adopted, the test will be implemented through a standard designed to prevent 457s being used in Australia to fill in unskilled positions or to covertly deliver to family and friends.
A government discussion paper was released today, denouncing the government's rhetoric about foreign employees, former Labour MP Maxine McCulloch said today that it could anger Australia's neighbors.
He told the U.S. India Institute today that "foreigners are reaching the end of the queue" and that loud rhetoric about "jobs for Australians first" is a very unpleasant repetition at a time when unions have demanded a safe labor market.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected — and I wouldn’t be surprised if some people in the area saw the echo of that historical evidence.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday where he met officials about the trafficking of people, has implemented five recommended changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "authenticity" criterion is adopted, the visa applicant may be examined as to "whether the nomination is true in circumstances in which the nominee is a relative or personal partner of the visa sponsor or the relevant person."
Businessmen may need to keep count of the number of 457 visa holders, as the first businessmen who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees hired hundreds of people.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after boarding a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man's distraught nine-year-old son had accompanied him on a trip to Australia, and after his father's death on Wednesday, one of his adult cousins, who was on the same ship, has drowned.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The study has been announced by the British government to increase Scotland's benefits from the HS2 rail project.
Works by HS2 point to high-speed services in Scotland and the northern part of England, which will begin soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kremer pointed out that the project "will make Britain one."
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the UK government on the project.
The first phase will include a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the second phase is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the cost of building high-speed links between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which was in talks with Scotland Transport, directed HS2 Limited to consider further improving rail capacity and travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the possible travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours or less.
According to Baroness Kramer: “Our goal for HS2 is to have a real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer.”
We are moving forward with HS2, as its benefits will be much higher.
Without this, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be further connected due to HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Alastair Carmichael: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmichael for Scotland's "clear" return to the HS2 network.
Mr Browne explained: “High-speed rail is likely to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in terms of high-speed rail throughout the UK.
We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British Government, so that we can explore options to bring high-speed rail to Scotland, create benefits for all, and fill the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report next year with the ministers of the British government and working together to decide on further course of action.
Aircraft electrical equipment rules will remain in effect in Australia
Despite the easing of equipment regulations in the U.S., Australian airline passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing aircraft.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the option open to U.S. aviation service companies to change their procedures, so that passengers during critical flight stages will be able to read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their equipment, provided they remain in "aircraft" mode.
Passengers can still do this during many flights, but many do not like being unable to access their e-books when flying and landing.
Australian aviation service companies are considering the decision, according to which US aviation service companies will have to do a lot more to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they do not have any immediate plans to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment are still in effect in Australia at critical stages of the flight.
“Currently, CASA does not have any specific regulation governing the use of electrical appliances in aircraft,” the authority said, adding that “this issue falls within the regulations, which require airlines to ensure that the safety system is always fully maintained, and that passengers are required to comply with safety instructions given by crew members.”
Virgin who is already in talks with CASA about expanding its use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system is set to follow this change, but asked to take further action at the regulator's directive.
"We would welcome a review by CASA in terms of allowing the use of electrical equipment, as we really feel it will provide a better experience to customers, as we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our planes," the spokesperson said.
Qantas said it would comply with current regulations.
"As per our current policy, electrical equipment cannot be used while flying and landing aircraft, and we have no immediate plans to change that," it said.
FAA decisions apply to U.S. allerlines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit travelers and we will certainly consider the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will vary on each U.S. aircraft service company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Aircraft service companies will need to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, as well as modify their manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and briefs to passengers.
The FAA said that "after airlines verify the tolerability of their aircraft, it will allow passengers to use hand-held, light-weight electrical devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all altitudes."
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their equipment while landing the aircraft.
The group also suggested keeping heavy equipment safely under the seat or in the upper compartments while flying and landing the aircraft.
Silver of Ponbrokers due to difficulty felt by the middle class in Singapore
Janani Amirthalinga, at the Ponshop at the Bendmeyer shopping centre in Singapore, is taking cash with her gold bangles, rings and earrings to pay her daughter's school fees.
"My husband and I have recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it," said Mrs. Amirthalinga.
She says that, although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars ($2,400) as an administrator, and her husband also works, the family's monthly income remains insufficient.
In fact, there is similar demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where domestic debt is on the rise - with Valuemax where they are doing their transactions, becoming the third ponshop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Placing jewellery mortgages is not the only way to get cash – in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga’s $1,300 Singapore dollars – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Generally, pawnbrokers in Singapore charge 17 percent interest per annum, slightly higher than the 15.4 percent offered by United Overseas Bank, which is the local lender that has a branch in the same shopping center.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring a credit check or proof of salary, and can provide loans much faster than a bank.
Millions of people are turning to Ponshops in the region due to the increasing cost of living by families and the difficulty faced by them due to the increase in domestic and consumer credit.
After five years of strong growth after the global financial crisis, and cheap credit due to simple monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to Ponshop to meet their needs due to the slowdown in their economies.
This week, rating agency Standard's Ange Poor's described rising domestic profits, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt to GDP ratio in Asia, it said.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged mildly from the tech slump this week.
On Thursday, data showed a sustained export slowdown and a decline in consumer demand.
“The decisive point is that with rising prices, people coming from the [income scale] middle to lower class will try to increase their income in every possible way,” said Song Seng Wun, economist at the Malaysian bank, CIMB.
Historically high values in gold prices over the past two years have led people to pledge personal assets as they take advantage of the opportunity to capitalize on the value of their family’s jewellery.
In Singapore, 70 per cent of the pledged items in the city-state's 200-pound outlet are gold.
People are saying "the gold feels good, let's pledge grandma's gold chain, and take it back next month."
Thailand's largest pontshop operator, Ejimani, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlet in recent months.
There is so much growth in the mortgage business that the operators of the outlet in Bendiemir and 15 others like it in Singapore are planning to expand to Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also to expand outside Asia, says Yah Li Ching, executive director of Valuemax.
The company will finance it using 60 per cent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it received in listing this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While there has been criticism of some discount lenders due to high interest rates, Ms. Yah says mortgages not only get cheaper rates compared to other lenders, but it also does not directly lead to an increase in debt.
"Customers pledge items that they already have, and cashing in on personal assets does not increase household debt," she says.
The social acceptability of poinbroking for short-term and secure financial support is increasing.
It is not that poinbrokers are used only by financially weak individuals.
Wealthy Singaporeans also use Valuemax outlets, pledge gold bars or Rolex watches to get cash payments of up to 60 per cent of their purchase price.
We have customers from all walks of life.
"These include wealthy individuals who need a short-term loan for business ventures or investments, or small businesses that need to meet their cash flow needs," says Ms. Yah.
Sometimes they need money in a very short time.
Business tycoon Mukesh Ambani is celebrating his 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Nita is celebrating her birthday in Jodhpur and not in Mumbai.
A large party was organised on the occasion.
Many Bollywood stars arrived in Jodhpur to attend the party. Late in the evening on October 31, many big stars were seen catching a flight to Jodhpur at the Mumbai airport.
The list includes Karisma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and his wife Kavita Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapur, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose and others.
Obviously, you can imagine how big this Jalsa will be when such a big name will join the party.
$325 million rescue package for Taggie's health
The federal government has stressed that there are stringent conditions attached to the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania’s ailing health system which will ensure that the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to address the current crisis caused by the island state's aging population, high rates of chronic diseases, and system limitations.
The funding decision, to be made over the course of four years, was made in consultation with the Government of Tasmania's independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has brought in an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the specific challenges being faced by the state," Ms. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package also includes a $31 million alternative surgery plan.
2600 additional operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgery, will help in resolving the past cumulative cases.
This includes funding for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-hospital care, training of medical experts, mental health services, and personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the best practices I’ve been told by leading physicians to improve Tasmania’s health system,” Ms. Plibersek said.
The Minister stressed that the Government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will have to maintain the current funding level to receive the Commonwealth funds, and report each month on where the additional funds are being spent.
A three-member commission will be constituted to ensure that service is rendered by the State in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
Mr. Wilkie said that $325 million would not mean much, “until real reforms are made to bring Tasmania’s public health system to a more sustainable level.”
Yet he praised the government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he first brought to the Prime Minister in early May.”
“I hope that the federal aid package will be very helpful towards separating the state-run public health system from the crisis-hit list,” Mr Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional alternate procedures will undo the recent deductions.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s announcement is “a band-aid solution.”
"We are here because the Labour State Government has taken $430 million into its health system," he told ABC TV.
You can't count the state government's half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth's 300 million dollars as good news.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plibersek should guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation of Dennis Diderot's novel by Guillaume Nicklaus details the finest production design and time period, but it has gone far beyond what it should have been.
The novel, which depicts the time of France in 1760, tells the tragic story of the name Suzan, a young noble who is sent to the convent by his family members.
When she revolts, she faces extreme cruelty at the hands of the voluntaristic victim, Mother Superior, and becomes an object of sexual attraction to the other.
This film never goes into eroticism or sensations - and that's the problem.
Due to the firm seriousness of the narrative, there is also a risk of making boring films for the audience.
CSA Vice-Chancellor Dr Munna Singh has decided to impose an entry fee in the garden due to the dirt in the garden.
At the same time, a 15-day ultimatum has been given to the departments to rectify the situation.
The Vice Chancellor, along with the Department of Horticulture, made a surprise inspection of the seeds and field and director research at 10 am on Friday.
During this time, he found more than a dozen employees, including directors in these departments, absent from their seats.
After being reprimanded, he threatened to cut his salary if he was found absent the next time.
Dr Naushad Khan, media in-charge of the university, said that a pass of Rs 30 will have to be made for a month-long walk.
People will be able to go for a walk in the garden at a fee of one rupee per day.
The system will work: Files related to various tasks before the Vice Chancellor will be accessed under one system.
Every employee will not have the right to enter the office of the Vice-Chancellor with his file.
The officers concerned will convey their final to the Vice-Chancellor.
The monitoring group said Syria had destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons.
The monitoring group said on Thursday that Syria had destroyed vital equipment to produce chemical weapons and toxic gas warfare materials, while a fierce conflict emerged in northern Syria, which is very close to where toxic agents are believed to be kept.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian movement group said nearly 120,000 people have been killed since the start of Syria's civil war that began nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons comes a day before the last date of November 1
What the Hague-based organization had prescribed to Damascus was to destroy or "ineffectively" destroy all chemical weapons production units and chemicals in toxic gases and the machinery used to fill in war materials.
The completion of the initial phase of destruction, in particular, marks a significant milestone in this ambitious development, which aims to destroy all of Dumascus' chemical weapons by the middle of 2014.
Destroying the equipment means that Syria can no longer build new chemical weapons.
However, Dumascus still has to destroy the existing weapons and collections.
Syria is believed to have 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve agent sarin.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the announcement came as the conflict escalated in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts believe is a chemical weapons production unit as well as a storage center.
The movement group, which details the death toll through its network of activists in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
It said 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children, were among those killed.
The government said 29,954 are members of President Bashar Assad's military, 18,678 are fighters fighting for the government, and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
It also said 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters were among the dead, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that nearly 100,000 people had been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
As a result of this conflict, about 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country.
Assad's forces fought the rebels in Safira for several weeks, many of whom belonged to al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the observatory said there had been casualties on both sides, but did not explicitly say anything.
This war reflects the threat faced by inspectors of chemical weapons, who have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war, in a very short time frame.
The OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said in a statement that its team is "just now satisfied and has confirmed - and has seen - the destruction of all Syria's declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment."
It also said, "No further inspection activity is being planned."
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first phase of confirmation work by visiting 21 of the 23 centres announced by Dumascus.
The inspectors said they were not able to visit the two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, the OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centers were "abandoned and ... chemical weapons product items placed there were transported to other declared centers, which have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the unit at Safira was one of the two centres where the OPCW inspectors were not able to go.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPCW next month.
"I salute the determination and courage shown by you people in fulfilling the most challenging mission this organization has ever undertaken," said Ahmet Uzumku, director general of the monitoring group, in a comment released by the OPCW.
The three-year civil war is mainly a conflict between Assad's government and its security forces, including members of the Shiite sect, as well as rebel Sunni Muslims.
In other developments, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a powerful explosion at the air defense center in the coastal region of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion is yet to be ascertained, he said.
The police have recovered a laptop, a laptop and photocopies of the forged documents from the possession of the accused.
The police has registered a case against all the accused.
The accused have been identified as Rajiv Agarwal alias Binttu, a resident of Chander Nagar in Haibowal, Kamal Krishan Jaswal, a resident of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi, a resident of Kohara and Sonu, a resident of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the registrar's office (east) has absconded from the spot.
According to the police, the accused, along with Balbir Singh, the clerk and record keeper of the registrar's office, used to extract documents from the vacant and old land records and then purchase new stamp papers and prepare a forged registry on them.
Not only that, but they also had a record of the actual recording of the event.
After this, the accused used to sell the land for crores of rupees on forged papers.
At the same time, they used to take loans on these fake papers.
After this, the real owner of the land used to remain in shock of the police and administration.
The accused, who had prepared the forged registry, kept a close watch on the lands of the NRIG.
Because there is no one to look after the land of the NRIG.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare and sell fake registry of those lands.
Police Commissioner Gill said that during interrogation, the accused told that they have prepared around 150 forged registers so far.
According to the police, Rajiv, the head of the gang, has already been booked for cheating and theft.
Condemned for plotting a bomb blast in Bali
The families and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in the 2002 bombings have expressed anger over the punishment to be given to the mastermind of the bombing, saying that Omar Patek should face the firing party.
Patek, who ran for nearly 10 years as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted individuals, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years for his role in building the explosive device used in the bombing.
If granted parole, he can be released in 15 years.
Omar, 45, was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring many others.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings at a church in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors had demanded a sentence of life imprisonment, although they could also demand that the man, who is notoriously called a "destructive person" as the mastermind of the bomb, be put to death.
The decision rekindled the painful memories of June Cortin, a Perth-based woman who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack carried out by Patek and his co-conspirators a decade ago.
While holding back his pleas, he said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really feel that he should have been punished the same way as other dreaded terrorists.
Ms. Cortin told the AAP, "He should be put in front of the firing squad."
I have to live every day without my grandchildren and my daughters.
Immediately after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002, the club was defunct after a bomb was detonated in a van parked outside The Whole Club.
Peter Hughes was in the paddies bar when a bag full of explosive material was detonated exactly 20 seconds ago by suicide bombers.
He went into a month-long coma as a result of the bombing and died three times while on life-saving equipment.
Mr Hughes says Patek should have received the same punishment as three other members of the Jemmah Islamiyah terror group responsible for the massacre - Amroji, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be put to death before anyone else.
You see, there is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring countless others, a 20-year sentence is not enough.
Patek is the last person to be convicted of Bali bomb blasts.
He evaded capture for nearly a decade, but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. military killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had submitted evidence that the report showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an effort to restore links between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"She did not surrender," says Ms. Cortin.
Even to this day, the pain of causing so many people mental anguish is not really there.
The decision, which comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," said Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal against his sentence.
FAA: Airplane passengers can now use gadgets in the aircraft (but can't make calls from cell phones)
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music - but will not be able to talk to their cellphones - under the highly-anticipated new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But travelers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said the speed at which these changes are implemented will vary from airline to airline.
The airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft meets the new guidelines, and how they are updating the rules for collecting training manuals and devices of their crew members to reflect the guidelines.
The FAA has said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
"Based on the state of the plan, we can very quickly approve the extended use of electronic devices," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the plane door is closed.
They are expected not to turn up until the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and is allowed by the captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the plane is about to land, and not turn it on until the plane is completely gone.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are fully protected from electronic disruption may allow their passengers to use the device while flying, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most of the new airline companies and other aircraft that have been modified in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.
“When the policy is safely implemented – and we work closely with airlines companies to do so – it will be a win-win for both sides,” Glading said in a statement.
When it comes to this issue, we are tired of feeling like "hall monitors."
But surfing, exchanging emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data by connecting to the Internet at altitudes less than 10,000 feet will still be restricted, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there will still be no conversation with friends, online Scrabble-like game, the famous incident related to which is that in the year 2011, actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while the plane was parked at the gate, and American Airlines dropped him from the plane when he refused to turn off the device.
And heavy equipment such as laptops, etc. will still have to be collected because their bouncing will cause injury to the other person in the cabin.
Cell phone calls will also continue to be banned during the flight.
The regulatory authority relating to phone calls is with the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
The FAA may lift restrictions on certain electronic devices during the flight and landing of the aircraft.
Last month Mark Rosenken, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are a really serious issue, not just because they could potentially disrupt navigation-related devices, but also because they could disrupt cell phone towers when they are in the air," Rosenker said.
The industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine the issue last month recommended that the government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
The FAA has been under increasing pressure in recent years to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo, have stated that there is no valid security reason for the prohibition.
These restrictions are becoming even more difficult to enforce because the use of the device is ubiquitous.
Some studies also indicate that nearly a third of travelers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their device.
The FAA began banning the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when reports of disruption to navigation and communication equipment were received by passengers for carrying FM radios and high-tech gadgets of the time.
New airlines are more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes for many years.
The modified aircraft for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to disruption.
Huerta said most airlines should meet the eligibility criteria for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today's electronic devices emit much less power than previous generation electronic devices.
E-readers, for example, have a very nominal transmission when turning pages.
But transmissions are stronger when downloading or sending data through the device.
Amazon.com has also been one of those who favoured reducing restrictions on the use of the device by travelers.
In 2011, the company officials loaded their entire Kindle e-readers in the airlines and flew them to test for problems but did not find any such problem.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks posed by the use of the device.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passenger Association said he believes the disruption from the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said that, there are only reports described by the pilot in support of the device being interrupted in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the members of the committee recommended that the FAA allow the pilot to order the passengers to turn off the device when the aircraft lands in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and called them a common-sense facility for people travelling in the latest era of technology.
Roger Doe, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, said: "We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that travelling with joy is not incompatible with passenger safety, safety and security.
Taking a cue from the serial blasts in Patna, the UT police have geared up for quick reaction during Diwali celebrations and emergency situations in view of the security situation.
A total of 1,800 constables will patrol all the main points of the city, crowded markets and other places along with vehicles and footpaths to ensure smooth operation of the traffic system, prevention of rash and negligent incidents, teaching of tricks and other incidents.
The police personnel will include PCR, traffic unit and women police personnel.
Police personnel and commandos will also carry out record checks at hotels, guest houses and other places in the city, including the PG.
The police have formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the case.
The DSP, along with the inspector, has been entrusted with the task of conducting investigations at markets, malls and other places in the VIP sectors of the city.
In view of the emergency situation and the festival of Diwali, the higher authorities have also fixed the duty of additional police personnel in police control in view of the convenience of the people.
The fire department and the PGI director, principal director and DHS along with the management of Sector-16 GMSH and Sector-32 GMCH and staff of other dispensaries have been asked to keep high alert in case of emergency.
To teach the manchalans a lesson, the departmental officers have now put women police personnel, among others, on duty by giving the name of 'Anti Goonda Staff' led by the NGO.
Police personnel of the anti-goonda staff team will keep a vigil at crowded places, including markets in plain clothes, to nab the miscreants.
On Diwali, all the SHOs have been ordered to install 44 nakas in the interiors of the city.
Police personnel will also be deployed at 38 naka points on the city borders.
Bird released back into the wild by air transport for protection from North Sea rig
The bird found nestled on the North Sea oil rig has been released back into the wild from the coast by air transport.
The bird, named Water Rail, was flown to Aberdeen by helicopter before being flown back by the Scottish SPCA to their Aloa rescue centre.
Center manager Colin Seddon reported: "This water rail was probably the winter migratory bird of Northern Europe, which was hit by strong winds over the North Sea."
It seems that this bird was tired and took refuge on the oil rig.
He further explained that: "It was unable to fly again so we were approached for help."
The water rail was healthy and fit before it was released.
Is Europe's Upper Class Ready to Do Business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April and pledged to bring the business together and determine what changes the UK's employment and prosperity makers would like to see in our relationship with the EU.
To that end, we conducted the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain’s business with the EU.
U-Gov took the views of 1,000 business leaders, who are representatives of the UK's business size, regions and locations.
The results of this survey can be surprising to many people.
We found that a large part of the business community now wants to export outside of Europe, and focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU member states are becoming stagnant.
They want the government to prioritise new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than engaging in a long-term and vicious process of reforming the EU’s secretive institutions.
When asked about his views on specific policy areas, such as from monopolistic regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that control of these decisive qualifications should come back to Westminster.
While general dissatisfaction with the single market could easily be seen, businessmen say the price of Brussels' regulation far outweighs the benefits of being part of Europe's business sector - even 40 percent of giant businessmen who traditionally favoured European companies agreed.
Finally and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that a large part clearly wants Britain to move on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change rather than politics with the EU.
The findings, which were seen in the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen were pushing towards a "meaningful change" that would give the U.K. back its lost power.
It has a very high price - the issue of treaty changes for Britain and getting a better deal changed 16 percent of the vote in favor of staying in the EU, in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not be in any doubt: the survey indicates that British businessmen support his plan to negotiate the terms of Britain's membership in the EU.
It also showed that businessmen expect the current balance of power to be renegotiated by making a meaningful change in favour of the UK.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming inevitable very quickly, as the Eurozone, the bound economy and the fiscal union move forward.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as our survey findings show, for businesses, this means a new focus on business and a radical change in Brussels' regulation practices.
Alexey Miller of Gazprom described the pipeline as the beginning of a new era in Bulgaria
The head of Gazprom said the start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marked the start of Europe's largest energy projects.
“Today marks a historic event: construction began on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream will diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
Officials said that a dispute between Gazprom's counterpart and Gazprom's contract in Ukraine, which accounts for the bulk of Russia's gas to Europe, poses a risk to traditional routes.
Miller said a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, would mean an end to "forever" the geo-political risks associated with transit countries.
Once the entire project is operational in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas at discounted rates from the South Stream.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA employees accused of sexual offences before charges against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission heard
Two YMCA NSW employees have been charged with child sexual offences before charges were filed against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011.
But in its statement before the commission, it said it had "never reported a case of child sexual abuse within its organisation", the commission was told.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee was accused of child pornography offences, and another case in which the YMCA Jim Instructor was accused of child sexual offences against children living in his care in 1991.
Mr Hare, who assisted the commission, said he was aware of the first case, but was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the statement of YMCA before the Commission that "YMCA has been subjected to external investigation and has found YMCA to be at the forefront of child protection" is also not accurate.
There is evidence before the Commission that YMCA was notified, and it achieved the second lowest rating among the four possible ratings in the Education and Community Department Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who has been associated with YMCA since the age of 21, admitted that the management had failed to "including myself" because of the appointment of the Lord, and failed to ensure that employees were clearly aware of their obligations to report child safety policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences with 12 children during a two-year term at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hare denied the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in the YMCA, due to which the staff did not report child safety violations by the Lord.
The staff gave evidence of what they saw of the breach, including Lord spending time alone with the children, babysitting them privately, putting them on their laps, telling them that he loved them and letting them play on his mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the Lord's supervision, and had asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that YMCA Caringbah Child Service Manager Jackie Barnat, who supervised Lord, was "very intimidating and difficult to get through most of the time".
The CEO said that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable giving information above their manager.
She said that, rather her friendship with the Lord misled her decision to inform about him.
Mr. Hare said that he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW Board that, the text for the organization from the "Jonathan Lord Incident" was "about not informing."
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the confidentiality agreement by the employees was taken by the Child Services General Manager of YMCA, Liam Whiteley, soon after the allegations surfaced.
He said the purpose was to avoid admixture of evidence, but it was not "excited" and executed correctly.
Stephen Smallbone, special professor of child sexual abuse at Griffith University, said that YMCA NSW was not a safe organization during Jonathan Lord's tenure between 2099 and 2011.
He said there were "serious problems" in the appointment, supervision, admission, training and supervision of the employees.
The hearing has been adjourned to December 20.
Blair says he wants to return to the UK
Tony Blair said he would like a chance to become Britain's prime minister again - but he believes a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview last night on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After stepping down in June 2007 after a decade as leader, Mr Blair largely avoided discussing British politics, confining most of his comments to his role as a representative of foreign affairs and Middle East group peacekeepers.
When asked if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr Blair was presented by London's Evening Standard newspaper saying: "Yes, sure, but it's unlikely to happen, so..."
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When a crowd of experts was gathering in Cardiff to showcase the horse for the best horse of the year, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not yet in school, and a few months away from taking his first step, this little boy and his pet pony Toffee from Shetland easily completed three stages and won the top prize - he surpassed his 30 adult competitors.
At the annual competition organized by the Sunnyback Equestrian Center in Rudy, near Cardiff, the undefeated pair - which is the same length as Sk - was highly praised for its appearance, behavior, and style.
In front of the men and women wearing beautiful bowler hats, he twisted his flat hat at a diagonal angle and made his two-year-old toffee ring round.
The decision-makers praised Fenton for his natural skill of controlling which is far ahead of his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for his appearance and personality.
The toffee was given to Fenton last March as a gift on her third birthday, and she has practiced daily with this pony from Shetland ever since.
Her 30-year-old mother Donna said: "Fenton and Toffee are a wonderful couple."
They had to face a challenge from all the candidates, but both of them won the Gold Cup and Rosette.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee, and we were all very happy with his win.
The most different in this theatre, he felt so wonderful to everyone that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from Nantiglo Village, near Ab Well, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howles, who has been performing horses for more than 10 years.
Mr. Howells said: "The whole place was full of excitement, and everyone was cheering and clapping."
He was running on sand all over the field, and despite looking so small, he did an extraordinary job.
Fenton is madly in love with animals - he loves horses, tractors, and farms, and has raised two chickens that he takes care of.
The kind he's started out with will be at the best horse exhibition of the year long ago - and I'm confident he'll do very well.
A spokesman for the annual horse exhibition said: “Fenton is only three years old, but he comes to control his pony.”
Theyre a very good couple.
The decision-makers gave the points given to Fenton and Toffee's performance and the way they performed in the show ring.
He saw good teamwork between Pony and his rider – in this case Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm pretty sure Fenton's cute clothes helped him out, he really looked very different.
The Chinese newspaper that argues will be "restored"
A Chinese newspaper that made an appeal on the cover page for the release of a reporter convicted of defamation will be restored, a press regulator said.
Guangzhou newspaper New Express had made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But then Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had taken bribes to write fabricated news about a state-owned company.
The regulator said the New Express now has to go through a "complete correction."
The order for "reform" came from the Guangdong Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express of the Yangcheng Evening News Group had published a lot of false news about the listed company Zoomloon in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of New Express was disorganized," the regulator said in a statement.
It said it had decided "to impose an administrative penalty by cancelling the license of Chen Yongzhou's reporter."
It had "directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete correction of the New Express, recommended in the New Express to investigate those responsible for it and immediately revise the New Express leadership team."
Mr. Chen wrote many articles in the New Express blaming financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zoomloon.
After his arrest, his newspaper published a two - page appeal for his release, saying that it supported Mr. Chen 's journalism.
But then Mr. Chen came on state television and admitted to writing and publishing false stories for money.
He told state broadcaster CCTV that "in this case, I have damaged Zoomloin as well as the entire news meow industry and its ability to win the trust of the people."
I did it mainly because I was greedy for money and fame.
I have realised my mistakes.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express issued a cover-up apology, saying it had failed to properly investigate his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have confessed to the TV broadcasts.
Experts say the convictions are made by force from time to time, despite a law later this year prohibiting authorities from forcing a person to plead guilty.
Sri Hanuman Chalisa will be recited by Sri Hanuman Singh Bitta, the national president of the Anti-Terrorism Front, along with 10,000 children, in the text of Sri Hanuman Chalisa to be held by the Sri Hindu Justice Bench at Dana Mandi near Jalandhar bypass on November 23.
This information was given by the Chief Spokesperson of the Sri Hindu Justice Bench Pravin Dung and Ashwani Katyal, Bhupinder Banga, Surjit Jain, Bunty Bajaj, Raman Khosla, Bantu and Anil Sharma after inviting them to recite the text of Hanuman Chalisa.
He praised the efforts of the Shri Hindu Nyay Bench to connect children with the eternal culture.
He said that for the unity and integrity of the country, it is also necessary to provide religious education including worldly education to the children.
U.S.-Mexico Drug Tunnel Finds Its Own Railway
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels has been found between the U.S.A. and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation, and electric rail system.
U.S. officials have described the four-foot-tall three-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret passages ever discovered.
The tunnel is equivalent to the sloping length of about six football pitches, connecting Tijuana, a warehouse near Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
The area is filled with similar warehouses, which makes it easy to hide the truck being drug-filled.
Officials said it was closed before any drugs passed through the tunnel.
According to court records, the authorities seized 8.5 tonnes of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the search of the tunnel.
The three men, who officials said were acting as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distributing them.
If convicted, they could face up to 10 years in prison and up to life imprisonment.
Traffickers in Nogales, Arizona, take advantage of the vast underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major route discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels since Central Mexico's marijuana harvest in October have been discovered, enabling drug mafia groups to challenge how to deliver the product to consumers faster.
In 2010, authorities found a route of about 700 yards equipped with rail tracks, stretching from a house in Tijuana to San Diego warehouses.

British police have issued an extradition notice to Assange.
British police today sent an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard said they had sent a "surrender notice" to 40-year-old Australian Assange, who would have to appear at the police station, adding that he would be responsible for his own arrest if he failed to do so.
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden for sexual offences charges, and his options under British law have been exhausted after the Supreme Court turned down his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Stockholm would hand them over to the U.S., fearing they would seek asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
A spokesman said Scotland Yard had "sent a surrender notice to 40-year-old Assange requiring him to be present at the police station at the date and time we chose."
He is in breach of his bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the police notice.
Assange fears that due to the release of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on an anti-privacy website called WikiLeaks, he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to face possible espionage charges.
A fine of 1000 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000) for driving a car at a speed of 130 mph with a hot drink between the legs
The driver has been fined 1,000 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000) for driving a car at a speed of 130 mph (210 km/h) by placing a hot drink between the legs.
Andrew Hovey, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped them, they found a drink on their feet.
At the Colchester Magistrates' Court, Hovey has admitted the charge of negligent driving.
Seven points were added to his license, which resulted in him being banned from driving a car for six months.
He was also ordered to pay a fee of 90 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>90) and a victim surcharge of 100 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>100).
Tax on foreign property owners will end London's artificial status
The Finance Department has provisionally enumerated the CGT measures, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who had introduced stamp duty at the rate of 7 per cent in the 2012 budget for houses worth more than 2 million pounds, and for persons who prefer to own a house in a company instead of an individual.
The stamp duty received from residential properties in Westminster and the towns of Kensington and Chelsea in 2012/13 was <0xC2><0xA3>708 million, which is already more than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr Cook explained: "After the increase in stamp duty for high-value homes and the introduction of the Associated Anti-Avoidance Legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high-value property has a reasonably low tax, which has nothing to do with the impact of the outdated council tax system.
He added that "but the move could lead to some foreign investors remaining silent about buying property in London and being reluctant to sell it to current owners."
Prime Property, the top 5 to 10 percent share of the housing market by value in wealthy south-west London, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, grew a record 11.8 percent last year.
Central London prices continued to rise by 5.6 per cent each year, but appeared to be slightly lower than the growing "domestic market," as the city's southwest, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) saw a surge, according to research by Saviles.
Scientists have shed further light on the topic of what is the relationship between a dog's tail movements and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs move their tail more to the right (from a dog’s point of view), while restless dogs move their tail mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that companion dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of the tail and react to it.
The study was published in journal Current Biology.
Neuroscientist Professor Georgia Vellartigra from the University of Trento reported: “In humans it is all too well known that the left and right parts of the brain are involved differently in the stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
They pointed out that in dogs, like humans, the right part of the brain was responsible for left-handed movements and reverse order, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to one-sided tail shakes by other dogs, researchers tracked animals while watching movies of other dogs.
They measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
It may not take long for us to understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Prof. Vellartigra explained: “We introduced the dogs to films of dogs – in realistic versions or in shadow-pictures to deal with other issues that are confusing, and we could see the tail movements and present the tail more left or right.”
And when they saw him, they lifted up their voices, and bowed themselves to him with their faces to the ground.
But when they saw the tail turning mainly to the left (from the dog’s point of view), their heart beat increased and they looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellartigra, he does not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience what actions they should be concerned about and what not.
He said: “If you’ve met other dogs many times, and if they constantly shake their tails to one side it’s related to more friendly behavior, and the right part presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience.”
Researchers say these findings could provide owners, veterinarians and trainers with better insight into animal emotions.
Fellow guest at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, John Bradshaw, an expert in dog behavior, told that this is not the first study to examine whether the left or right part is important for dogs.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their head to the left when they see an aggressive dog and turn their head to the right when they see a happy dog.
In other research from the University of Victoria in Canada, they pointed out: “Unlike Italian studies – when the robot dog’s tail moved to the left rather than the right, dogs were more likely to approach it rather than restless.”
He said that this difference was because dogs in various studies did not fully understand animals or robot dogs in the movies.
He explained that in this, the study of how dogs react to real dogs can help.
"While there is considerable evidence from different mammals that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still to be found - and dogs in this case are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it probably won’t take us long to understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone Glasgow gig due to Alex Turner's illness
The Rock Bank of the Arctic Monkeys has postponed gigs in Glasgow after its lead singer suffered from a sore throat.
The Sheffield Group's schedule was scheduled to be put on display at the hydro site in the city on Friday.
But the illness of his lead singer Alex Turner forced him to reschedule the show.
The band's announcement came as they were forced to postpone gigs in a similar manner at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to postpone the show at the Birmingham LG Arena tonight, following medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1.
"Investigation found Alex Turner to be having a sore throat, and he's sadly not able to perform."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, and the show at Glasgow Hydro will take place on November 21.
All tickets will be valid for these shows.
We apologize for any inconvenience caused to all ticket holders.
For any other assistance, contact the customer service at the box office from which you purchased the tickets.
Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February.
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term on February 22.
The Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church, having only a position below the Pope, and they are the ones who choose the Pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of his men, who will eventually help him choose his successor.
There are a total of 201 cardinals.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the election of the pope - it falls into the group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony to promote the new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals will be held, called the pope-assembly.
“Pope Francis has decided to advance his decision to hold the Pope-Council of February, to make it easier to plan other meetings involving Cardinals from different countries of the world,” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors was likely to decline by February.
In general, the Pope announces the number of cardinal electors as low as 120, the number of cardinals, and the names of the cardinals who are over 80 years of age at will, he said.
Valero said that next year's papal meeting will be important because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year.
Currently, there is a kind of bias towards Europe and especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope, to restore balance, nominates cardinals from the rest of the world as well," he said.
Forty percent of South America has Roman Catholics, but their number in the cardinals is very small.
The Cardinals' Council - a group of eight cardinals from around the world whose task is to find ways to reform the church - will also be the first cardinals to be elected after it was formed by Francis.
Before that, the Pope made all the decisions on his own.
“Right now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was "possible" that Francis sought advice from Cardinals.
But we haven't been in this situation before - it's completely new.
Valero said that usually the pope gives the post of cardinal to the bishop of large places, but Francis was “totally surprising – so we don’t know whose name they will announce.”
GM recalled pickup trucks in the U.S. to correct seatbacks
According to a notification from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday, General Motors Co. has recalled about 19,000 trucks to correct a reduction in hand-held seatbacks in its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks.
There may be a decrease in the front seat rotation system in some trucks.
As a result, the union failed to comply with auto safety standards regarding seatback, headrest.
According to a notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website, "If the vehicle gets stuck behind, it is possible that the headrest may not properly protect the driver, which will increase the risk of injury."
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM's trucks began shipping in June and, since the 2009 bankruptcy renewal, it represents the most important Wuhan launch for the top U.S. automaker.
GM had informed the truck owners about the defect in late October.
The NSTMA could not review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had hampered the growth in auto sales in October.
GM said on Friday that sales of Silverado and Sera trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, had increased by 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM sold 42,660 silverados and 16,503 sera pickup trucks.
GM's stock was up 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
Obama's disillusionment with the electorate
I voted for Obama twice, hoping for a change.
He says Obama's great efforts have been hampered by the GOP's policy of blocking
Obamacare website’s woes can’t excuse drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign memoir reminds us of what could have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading a lot of sad books these days.
This is a book that I think will encourage me during the second year of medical school depression and give me a ray of hope.
It's called "Courage to Win", and it's a memorial to Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I am able to breathe through the pages of my patients at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a time in which politics inspired millions and speech could hold your breath.
The elections proved to be one-sided, and news speakers took a break to reflect the historical significance of that time.
There were tears of joy in the eyes of my classmates, and my parents saved every newspaper they found.
A group of young visionary men were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
When Obama became president in 2008, he had an approval rating of 82 per cent.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, as if coming back from the dream world.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad memory of lost opportunities.
There was a real change after I voted for the first time.
To put it simply, I could not have imagined any of this.
I owe Obama a lot of achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our forces from Iraq, to the end of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" until Osama bin Laden was killed.
In addition, I believe that the policy of partisan opposition has prevented many of our country's efforts to move forward: including immigration reform, public options for healthcare, closing the base on Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But in the countless times that I have stood up for the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues, I have an answer that I can give them.
I have come to the point of political despair.
Republican opposition policy is not the answer to spying on foreign leaders, nor is it the answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency’s collection of data about the private lives of ordinary American citizens, nor can it respond to prosecuting those who expose the government’s wrongdoings.
It cannot justify the murder of American citizen Anwar El Alawalki without a trial, nor the diminishing public funds and spending limits during the presidential campaign.
It cannot answer the findings of a report that says efforts by the White House to silence the media have been “the most aggressive since the Nixon administration.”
And most recently it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website even after three years of being signed into law by the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if I expected that.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the system of governance could refute the political campaign that brought it forward.
Clearly, the elected office is not a predictable route, because opposing political parties and random events such as the Newtown Massacre will shape our public discourse.
Yet all the examples I have given above seem to have been mostly chosen by the administration itself.
This is what bothers you the most.
I re-voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his candidacy.
Mitt Romney offered a confusing and uncertain alternative, which did not seem to be his policies or his position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free of the pressures of future elections, would deliver the hopes that we have been hearing for a long time.
Yet, while Obama’s permissive rating is down 45 percent this week, it has become much harder to return to the year 2008 through that book.
When I look at him, I remember his lost words.
A portion of the book was read this week, describing how Clinton suffered a huge loss because of Obama in the Pennsylvania primaries.
In a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinates that they needed to get back on track, and to remain loyal to their objectives.
"I want my mojo back," he said.
We must remember who we are.”
Today, after five years, Mr. President, I cannot agree with you any more.
The views expressed in this comment are those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims PM Tony Abbott’s interest in parental leave plan is conflicted
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott's interest in the paternity leave scheme is a struggle because his daughters can get pregnant, and take advantage of it.
Maharathi of the mining sector, who is in dispute over the payment of the $6 million carbon tax bill, has claimed while he has tried to answer questions about the conflict.
Palmer could control up to four votes in the United Party Senate, which could be crucial in determining how to reduce carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr Palmer has claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest, and said Mr Abbott's daughters could personally benefit from the policies.
"In the case of paid parental leave, they may have a significant interest conflict, because if any of their daughters get pregnant they will have a direct interest whether they get leave or not," Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Election Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes after falling again.
Mr. Palmer called for a re-run of the counting of votes to speed up the process.
Tony Aut's daughters, Franz and Bridget.
Should the election result come two months after we have voted?
"We should have a better system," he said.
Why can’t we have a system in which we fill in our details on the computer, vote immediately and we have the results at 6:30 in the evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark the ballot papers.
Is it because if someone doesn’t like it, they can delete it?
The use of pencils in this day and age is absurd.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his policies included the creation of an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and that he would take his new job "very seriously."
A public post is meant for public service.
“We want no other awards than the history awards that we can serve the community at this important time,” he said.
This has caused inconvenience to the litigants.
Addressing the gathering, Bar Association president Ramesh Singh Negi expressed his anguish over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.
He said that the fast-growing attacks on lawyers and their families prove that criminals have become fearless.
They have no fear of the police and the administration.
Referring to recent incidents at different places, he said the safety of the common man can be easily gauged when the advocate society is not safe.
RBS suspends two forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its Foreign Exchange Department, the case received information from two experts, another sign that the global investigation by regulators into suspected manipulation of the currency market is moving at a rapid pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, which exchanges $5.3 trillion each day.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been suspended as the investigation into what appears to be a repeat of the Libor interbank loan manipulation scandal continues.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, confirming that the bank has received a request for information from regulators this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank said, "Our investigation into this case is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators."
Last month, people familiar with the matter said that RBS had sent emails sent and received from the former trader and records of instant messages to the UK Regulatory, Financial Conduct Authority.
Richard Usher left RBS in 2010, and is believed to have retired from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at J.P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramachandani, head of European spot trading in the city, went on holiday last week, while the former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
People familiar with the matter said that Mr. Usher's instant messaging group includes bankers from Barclays and Citigroup.
UBS said it has taken action against some of its employees this week after the Swiss regulator, FINMA, reported that it was investigating suspicious manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
Globally, at least six authorities - the European Commission, FINMA, Switzerland's Competition Authority Veco, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the U.S., and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are investigating bankers for alleged misappropriation of funds to get their currency market moving.
People familiar with the matter said that HSBC, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal investigations, or have received requests for information from regulators.
Banks have been closely scrutinising instant messages and emails, equivalent to many years, in search of clues for any wrongdoing.
The news about the investigation has created a stir among traders in the region, who have been among the most profit-making majors in the trading unit of investment banks for the past several years, but they are facing a challenge this year, as opportunities for speculators have decreased due to low volatility in currencies.
Some bankers tried to suppress the matter by saying that it is impossible to manipulate the very large and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that this is not necessarily true.
The senior trader said that the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms despite the huge volume of foreign exchange buy-and-sells and the increased use of their own platforms by banks means that "you can start to influence the market at a slightly lower ticket price."
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced this week that it would be decommissioning the trader from its exchange-traded funds desk in London, which lost about $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
"We believe that the trader acted alone, and has been controlled," Credit Suisse said.
Students studying other courses, including technical and management, running on the campus, will be able to exercise their franchise this time.
The university vice-chancellor has written to the governor seeking permission to hold elections.
With the beginning of the admission process in the university, the demand for holding student union elections began.
He had also launched a signature campaign to select his representative to convey his voice to the university administration and college management.
Around two dozen courses including BTech, MBA, Pharmacy, Biotechnology, Bioscience, Tourism Management and Paramedical Science running in the campus will be selected this year.
More than 6,000 students studying here will get a chance to exercise their franchise for the first time.
Vice-Chancellor Prof Ashok Kumar said that he has sought permission from the Governor to hold elections in the university.
The date of the election will be announced soon.
"""It is the responsibility of the college management to conduct elections in other colleges."
Many college managements do not want student union elections on their campus.
At the same time, due to lack of unity among the students, elections are not being held.
The Council had launched a signature campaign for the election.
Akash Jaiswal, ABVP Convenor
After Diwali, permission will be sought from the district administration to hold elections in colleges.
There is also a lack of clarity about the college's approach to student union elections.
On Dhanteras, people have bought a lot of gold and silver from utensils in the capital.
Such purchases have gone up by 20-30 per cent over the previous year
There was a huge rush of people in the jewellery shops in Shimla.
A large crowd was also seen in the shops of utensils decorated from the lower market to the Mall Road.
This year, though, there was an increase in the price of such items, but people still did not show any reluctance to buy them at a good price.
On Friday, the auspicious time for shopping was from 7:52 am to 10:12 am and from 1:56 to 3:37 pm and from 6:17 pm to 8:12 pm.
At the time of the said three Muhurat, more crowds of people flocked to the suburbs, including Shimla, for more shopping.
In Shimla Lower Market, there was no place for people to sit on their feet.
In every small and big shop, the crowd looked the same.
In such a situation, when shopping on Dhanteras, which is celebrated as Dhantrayodashi Dhantrayodashi of Krishna Paksha in the month of Kartik, there are signs of auspicious Deepawali.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared healthcare law constitutional in the name of Barack Obama.
By a vote of 5-4, the judges ruled in favour of a separate order of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requiring citizens to purchase or pay health insurance before 2014 that it was constitutional under the power of the government to impose taxes.
Chief Justice John Roberts supported four other liberal members of the court, while the other judges, Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy, disagreed.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2,700-page law, saying the condition of the healthcare law that states increase Medicaid eligibility or lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutional.
The petition was brought by 26 states and the National Independent Business Federation to block the law.
The law was opposed by all major Republican presidential candidates during the early 2012 session, including projective nominee Mitt Romney.
It is true that we cannot function without money.
Money is one of the biggest needs for living, but it is not in our interest to assume everything.
We celebrate Dhanteras on the Krishna Triyodashi of Kartik month.
Dhanteras is dedicated to Kubera, the god of wealth and death, Yamaraja.
Money has an important place in our lives.
No money is good or bad.
We have a bad attitude towards money.
Nothing can be more valuable than the money which has been used for the welfare of humanity, but the money which has been the cause of arrogance has no meaning.
Let us earn money for the holy purpose and spend it only for the holy purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
Part of it must also be the sense of spending on society, but the tendency of unaccounted collection or yen - ken - travesty to earn money destroys our conscience, personality.
The spirit of giving should always be in the mind.
A portion of the money you give can also become the basis of someone's life.
We should all think for the many people in society who are living in a terrible deprivation.
In fact, in the Purushastras of life, meaning, religion, work and salvation are given equal importance.
All of them desire wealth and success, and according to their effort, they also get wealth and success.
It is the wealth with which the honour is attached.
No matter how rich a criminal may be, he can neither consume it properly nor benefit anyone else.
Do not give money to anyone else.
He is the one who has the right of way and the right of way.
There can be no better use of money than to create employment for others.
Another thing, money is not just in the form of money.
It would also be in the form of your health, character, love for others.
Try to be the owner of that money.

The Income Tax Department has planned to launch a campaign to collect advance tax from the taxpayers to achieve the target.
The department has issued notices to more than 100 NGOs, including the Mahabodhi Temple Managing Committee, which has been declared a World Heritage Site.
School students who are the tax payers of the future.
Officers have arrived.
Saurabh Kumar Rai, deputy commissioner of Gaya zone, informed about the departmental action plan on Tuesday.
Deputy Commissioner Rai said that the target for the current financial year is around Rs 9 crore.
About 40 per cent of this is achieved through TDS and TCS.
There are many sources for the remaining amount.
He said that taxpayers are urged to deposit advance tax.

He said that the Chief Commissioner of Income Tax himself has come to the Chamber's call in 'Madam' Gaya.
He said that the policy is to make students of classes 9-12 aware about tax.
In this way, they have become familiar with many of the school children themselves.
Children also inspire their parents to be a good taxpayer.
He said that there are a total of 42,000 members of the Income Tax Department.
This includes officers from the military.
He said the department had collected Rs 5 lakh crore in revenue in the last financial year.
Deputy Commissioner Rai said that they are going to seek information from the Commercial Tax Department about the action taken against tax evaders.
The programme began with the lighting of the national anthem and lighting of the lamp by all the guests.
Director Dr SK Garg said that the annual festival of the institute is celebrated as Foundation Day.
Students of the institute and former students of the institute were honoured with cash awards.

Megha Singh and Preeti Kaushik conducted the function.
Special Judge IS Mehta remanded Ahmed to 14-day judicial custody after accepting the NIA's plea.
While presenting Uzair Ahmed before the court, the NIA said that Uzair Ahmed was the main accused in the Patna serial blasts along with Indian Mujahideen members Imtiyaz Ansari and Haider.
Ahmed had introduced several other terrorists to Ansari.
Through interrogation of Ahmed, the NIA also wants to arrest other accused in the case.
In this case, the search for the bomb-making equipment and the terrorists who made it is still pending.
For this, he has to take Ahmed to Bihar, Jharkhand and several states, for which he needs to be taken on remand.
The NIA had arrested Uzair Ahmed from Ranchi on October 30 in connection with the Patna serial blasts case.
A day earlier, the Special Task Force (STF) had revealed that the PMT in 2012 was fake.
The STF has found a glitch in the roll number of 700 students in the investigation.
Of these, around 125 students had taken admission in medical colleges.
Now these students' admission can be cancelled.
After the STF's disclosure, the medical education department has started a manhunt to cancel the admission of these students.
According to the information, the department is waiting for the list of all these suspected students to meet the STF.
The list will be sent to Vyapam for cancellation of the eligibility of the students involved.
However, the department is also seeking legal advice in this regard.
Departmental officials say that since it has been a year since students took admission in 2012, it is important to seek legal advice in this matter.
With the matter limited to the STF investigation, the medical education department officials are not in a position to say anything.
Vyapam director Tarun Pithore said if the STF submits the list of suspected students with evidence, their admissions will be cancelled immediately.
Meanwhile, Director of Medical Education Dr Nirbhay Srivastava said that he has not ruled out cancelling the admission of the students if they are found to be fake.
According to STF officials, fake students involved in the 2012 PMT are being investigated.
After the investigation, the list of suspected students will be handed over to Vyapam.
Vyapam had cancelled the eligibility of 345 students who appeared for the PMT exam in 2013.
Out of these 345, the Medical Education Department has so far cancelled the admissions of 84.
Aijaz Jan, MLA from Poonch assembly constituency, inaugurated the water cooler in the gurdwara premises.
The MLA said that a large number of people visit the gurdwara, but due to lack of proper arrangement of drinking water, water coolers have been installed here.
This will allow people to get cold water on hot days.
Pure plain water will be available during the winter season.
With this, the problem of drinking water will be solved for the devotees coming here.
Members of the Gurdwara Committee and others were present on the occasion.
If the new government continues its policy of discontinuing the sale of kerosene through ration after the general elections, then in half a dozen states, there will be no kerosene at these shops.
The states where the sale of kerosene is to be stopped include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand.
Apart from these, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some states in the northeast are also preparing to discontinue the sale of kerosene.
According to sources in the petroleum ministry, a decision will be taken to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states on two grounds.
The first is that electricity connections are being made rapidly in rural areas.
The second is the LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped in the states where most of the rural households have been given LPG connections.
The Ministry of Petroleum has made preparations in this regard.
PDS Kerosene has already been discontinued in Delhi since October 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, the kerosene quota for Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand has been reduced significantly.
The quota of Punjab has been reduced from 2.72 lakh kg to one lakh kg.
While the allocation of Uttarakhand has been reduced by 70 per cent, the kerosene quota in Haryana has been reduced by about 40 per cent.
Despite this reduction, there have been no reports of kerosene shortages from these states.
The ministry is of the view that it is clear that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
There is a difference of Rs 37 between PDS Kerosene and diesel prices at present.
This will encourage those who are struggling.
In states where sales will be stopped through PDS, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.
Currently, oil companies are incurring a loss of more than Rs 39 per litre on kerosene.
In 2013-14, the kerosene subsidy burden is estimated to be around Rs 31,000 crore.
The accused used to cheat in the name of buying and selling of shares by opening the accounts of investors by referring to the trading firm.
Probably for the first time in the state, such disclosures have revealed cheating of crores of rupees.
The police have not been able to reach the head of the gang so far, but seven people, including the accused, have been detained by the police who are looking after his work in the state.
The gang used to operate a fake commodity market called MetaTrader-5.
The owners of the company used to take cash from investors and create fake IDs on a fake software.
This led to the accused buying shares of the investors when trading.
It also shows the price at which the shares were bought.
In fact, no shares were bought and there was no transaction for this, as no demat account of investors was opened and the shares on this fake software were shown to be false.
Police suspect that hundreds of people have been involved in the racket.
Every investor invested between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 5 lakh in the name of making a profit.
The main accused, Amit Soni, has been detained by the cyber cell from Jodhpur while six of his accomplices have been arrested from Indore.
According to ADG Cyber Cell Ashok Dohre, any stock trading company is required to join the stock exchange as a trading firm.
Only after this, the company can trade shares to investors through its own.
Then the investor's demat account is opened so that the shares can be bought and sold for it, but this company named MetaTrader-5 was neither associated with any exchange nor stock trading.
The company had purchased the server for itself on September 24, 2012, citing trading in the name of WinTrade.
Since then, people have been duped in the name of investment through this company.
At present, eight traders from Indore have come forward with complaints in the cyber cell.
The amount was not transferred to the account even after selling the purchased shares for profit.
He demanded a profit from the company's promoters.
Investors have even been saying that the price of their bought shares was always lower on the fake ID given to them.
The price was fixed by the accused at his own level.
The company has appointed its CEOs and agents in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.
Agents used to advise people to join this company by luring them more profits.
After this, Rs 2 lakh was deposited from one person and Rs 5 lakh from another person.
The players of this team keep creating new records on the day of the test and now their status in the ODI is gradually increasing.
A great example of this was seen on Thursday when a good-natured New Zealand team defeated Bangladesh in the ODI series to win the title.
Bangladesh beat New Zealand by 40 runs in the second ODI to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
This is Bangladesh's sixth consecutive win over New Zealand in ODI cricket.
Earlier, New Zealand had lost the series 0-4 in the 2010 tour of Bangladesh.
Chasing Bangladesh's target of 248 runs, New Zealand lost wickets at regular intervals in the face of Ghazi's (34/3) spin and Murtaza's (43/3) stormy bowling, leaving the team bundled out for 207 in 46.4 overs.
For New Zealand, Ross Taylor top-scored with 45, while Corey Anderson scored 37.
Kyle Mills contributed an unbeaten 27, while Nathan McCullum contributed 25 runs, but none of the team's batsmen could convert a good start into a big innings which led to the team's defeat.
Earlier, Bangladesh were bowled out for 247 in 49 overs despite Tamim Iqbal's (58) half-century.
James Neesham and Anderson scalped two wickets each.
Anderson took four wickets for 40 runs while Neesham took four wickets for 53 runs.
Tamim became the highest run-scorer for Bangladesh in ODIs.
Tamim, who surpassed Shakib Al Hasan, has 3702 runs in 124 matches.
The third and final match of the series will be played in Fatullah on Sunday.

The Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) is running a multi-storey office building in the city.
In such a situation, all employees are forced to work in fear of accidents.
There is an atmosphere of fear among the staff working in the building due to the falling of cement from the roofs of this building.
Built in 1913 in the British era, this building had the office of the first Municipal Corporation.
The building was handed over to the Electricity Board in 1995.
The department is trying to get rid of the name of its repair by doing only colour correction.
The condition of the building has become so bad that the employees are afraid to sit in it.
The condition of the building is so bad that plaster often falls from the ceilings.
In the last one month, cement has fallen from the roofs of four rooms.
A woman employee was also injured in the incident.

At present, there are around 400 employees working in the building.
This includes 5 XEN, 12 SDOs, 20 junior engineers, 130 clerical staff, 200 technical staff and 20 other staff members.
However, nothing has been done so far to ensure the safety of the residents.

In such a situation, the condition of the building can be easily guessed.

BJP's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on Friday launched a scathing attack on the Congress while addressing an election rally in Pune to inaugurate a part of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital.
"""In many states of the country and at the Centre, there was a coalition government, sometimes a Congress government, sometimes a Communist government, sometimes a BJP government."
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call upon the political pundits, economists of the country.
Some parameters should be fixed in the country.
What the team has done.
If there is a comparative result, then the question will not come before the country whether the BJP government should come or not.
Whenever and wherever the BJP government has been formed, efforts have been made to fulfil the aspirations of the people.
This country is a witness to the fact that under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai, inflation was low.
The poor man would get food twice.
But when the Congress or a government with its support was formed, the poor man was not fortunate enough to eat.
Not a single Congress leader, not a single UPA leader is responding to what he has done in nine-and-a-half years.
Even the media in our country is not able to reach them.
The Congress has become arrogant.
They don't even answer to the media.
The elections are for the Lok Sabha, you answer to the people.
"In an attack on Congress leader Kapil Sibal, Modi said, ""In 2014, when the people will bless the BJP, they will give an account of their work to the people every year."
In a democracy, the servant should sit, not the ruler in Delhi.
There can be no Nath in Delhi, there should be only Dass there.
The friends of the Congress party keep leaving the balloons every day.
Friends of the Congress, we have given the exam 10 months ago.
In a democracy, people take the test.
Google, Samsung, Huawei have filed an economic lawsuit in the case of Nortel Patents.
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, on Thursday filed a series of patent lawsuits against cell phone makers, including Google, which it overtook in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, the association that bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, has sued Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., HTC Corporation, Huawei, and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The lawsuit said that these patents also include the technology that matches the words searched on the Internet with relevant advertising, which is a core part of Google's search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make phones that run Google's Android operating system, which competes strongly with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google had made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google eventually offered $4.4 billion, increasing the bid multiple times.
After losing to Rockstar in Nortel patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, one of the main reasons Motorola had a long list of patents.
The lawsuit states that "Google has violated, and continues to violate, despite losing out in an attempt to acquire patents-in-suits at auction."
Rockstar has sought enhanced compensation against Google, alleging that it was violative of its patents.
Believed to be the first freely elected president in Egypt
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of office, but his victory days hardly brought an end to the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president to replace deposed Hosni Mubarak 16 months ago.
On his formal installation before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world, and Egypt's fifth head of state since the monarchy was overthrown nearly 60 years ago.
He took the oath of office on the banks of the Nile in front of 18 black judges of the court in his chair, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking forward to a better future, a new Egypt and another republic," Morsi said during a formal ceremony broadcast live on national television.
The hardline group Muslim Brotherhood, which has spent 84 years as an outlawed organization since its founding, and which has been targeted by previous governments, said 60-year-old Morsi, the party’s U.S.-trained engineer, “Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – complete freedom, true democracy, and stability.”
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building and shortly after 11 a.m. local time, Morsi arrived in a small convoy of cars.
Since Mubarak’s time, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to congratulate the new president, even as traffic was stopped for a brief moment so that his motorcade would leave the usual busy street, which connects the city centre to its southern suburbs.
Morsi's personal reputation, ridiculed as the Brotherhood's non-christian "empty tire", rose sharply after his victory, and his speech on Friday presented him not only as an Islamist but as a candidate of all those who seek to complete the 2011 revolution against dictator Mubarak.
Wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, Morsi took the oath of office in front of judges sitting in a wooden paneled chamber, saying that "Egypt today is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation."
Morsi then moved to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
They were officially welcomed by the military band by playing the national anthem while they stood in a posture of caution.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussain Tantawi was also present.
On his arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture hall at the main university there were greeted with the slogan that "the army and the people are one hand."
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a bastion of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath at Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's dictatorial rule last year, and vowed to take back the presidential powers he had been stripped of by the military council from the ousted leader last year.
But by agreeing to take the official oath before the Court instead of formally swearing in the able of Parliament, they bowed to the will of the Army, which is an indication that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech at Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic popular currencies.

Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly acknowledged that in some cases U.S. espionage has crossed the line.
At the same time, he claimed that innocent people have not been tortured under the intelligence surveillance programme.
Kerry's confession came during his address to the annual summit of the Open Government Partnership held in London via video link.
"""I assure you that innocent people are not being harassed in this process,"" Kerry said."
But in an attempt to obtain information, inappropriate methods have been adopted in some cases.
Meanwhile, an important committee of the US Congress has approved a bill limiting the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency (NSA).
The aim is to make surveillance more transparent and restore the trust in people that has been hurt by the disclosure of large-scale phone tapes.
The Senate move has been welcomed by six US companies, including Google, Yahoo.
The NSA has also broken into the data centers of these companies.
The Select Committee of the Senate on Friday passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reform Bill (FISA) on the NSA by 4 votes to 11.
The bill mentions a number of restrictions, including a ban on one-time phone tapping under the US Patriot Act.
Under the FISA, the purposeful unauthorized data collection and its use will be treated as an offence and there is a provision for a jail term of 10 years.
The bill will become law after it is passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
"""The NSA's phone recording program is in accordance with law and I believe it has made a significant contribution to the security of the country,"" said Senator Diane Festin, chairman of the committee."
But there should be more transparency.
The safety of the public should also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have supported the bill, angered by the revelation of the NSA's Internet surveillance program.
In a letter to the senators, the companies said they welcomed the proposal by lawmakers to restrict the NSA from recording large-scale phone calls.
The NSA's actions were removed from documents released by former CIA employee Edward Snowden.
The international community is outraged after the NSA revealed that it was monitoring the telephonic conversations of 35 heads of state, including Germany and France.

The next hearing of the case against Musharraf is on November 11.
In 2007, Maulana Ghazi Abdul Rasheed was killed in a military operation against the militants hiding in Lal Masjid.
In this case, the police have already given a big relief by acquitting Musharraf.
According to the police, Musharraf was not directly involved in the killing of the cleric.
Islamabad Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Wajid Ali Musharraf is hearing the bail plea.
During the hearing, Tariq Asad, a representative of Lal Masjid Shuhada Foundation and counsel for the complainant, alleged that the police had destroyed all evidence to prove Musharraf's innocence.
The lawyer sought some time from the court to produce more evidence in the case.
The court then adjourned the hearing on Musharraf's bail plea till November 4.

The Flight Center is moving forward with this trend.
The company has increased its full-year profit forecast, and is expecting record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company expects its full-year net profit before tax to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared with $305 million and $315 million in the previous forecast.
If the target is achieved as per the current guidance, it will increase by 12 to 17 per cent from the record $290.4 million profit achieved in 2011-12.
Management Director Graham Turner said that Flight Center has made a profit of 8 percent in the first half, and made a good start in its second half, especially on non-business travel to Australia and the UK.
“As of now, our 10 countries are in profit, and many countries are on a record full-year income before interest and tax contributions,” he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually our most profitable centres.
The holiday business has regained momentum in Australia in the second half, meeting the shortage of a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market.

The U.S. business had replenished its deficits in its first half of the season, and is expected to deliver full-year gains for the third consecutive year.
Flight Centre shares were up 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
In a recent media report, it was said that the NSA blew information from Yahoo and Google's data centers for spying.
The Washington Post has made the disclosure on the basis of documents collected from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
According to the report, the NSA's program was named Muscular, which it ran in collaboration with its British counter part-GCHQ.
The two agencies stole data from the huge fiber optic cable network that Yahoo and Google had laid.
The Washington Post quoted a top secret document dated January 9, 2013 as saying that more than 180 million documents were collected in just three days from the start of the program.
These include email, text, audio and video messages.
According to the Washington Post, the program was run out of the US and a benami telecommunications provider helped the NSA gain access to this information.
According to the newspaper, it was easier for the NSA to run this program outside the US, because there are court orders in the US for such operations.
"""As far as I know, this has never happened,"" NSA chief general Keith Alexander said at a press conference in Washington."
The NSA has always collected all the information within the framework of the law.
The NSA was recently targeted for spying on the German chancellor.
The United Nations said on Wednesday that the US administration has assured that its communications system will not be monitored.
The US has also said that the communication system of the United Nations is not monitored.
GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi's close aide Amit Shah, who is the prime ministerial candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), arrived here on Thursday afternoon with his family.
Among those present on the occasion were district president Jainendra Kumar, national convener of non-conventional energy sources Krishan Kumar Singh, Hisua MLA from Nawada Anil Singh, Anil Swami, Shyama Singh, Mukesh Kumar, among others.
District President Kumar informed that Shri Shah reached Gaya Airport in a special aircraft at Shaktipeeth Maa Kamakhya Temple in Assam.

They returned to the Vishnupad temple on a special flight after offering prayers.
District President Kumar said that Mr Shah's Gaya programme was not made public due to security reasons.
Schools urged to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
English literature courses require students to read at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and a contemporary British story from 1914 onwards.
The exam will also include "not seen text" to encourage greater reading.
A joint English literature and language course will be abolished.
From the year 2015, students will have to take a separate GCSE in the language, and there will be a lot of motivation to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release a new syllabus for English and Mathematics tomorrow – both of which will be the first subjects to undergo revolutionary changes.
It will also change to other main topics next year.
In a separate step, the exams will showcase the changes in the structure of GCSEs with regulatory authoritative, new grading system, and reduced syllabus.
Speaking in the summer, Secretary of Education Michael Gove said that "there was a lot of consensus that we need to improve our own examination system to restore people's confidence", adding that "GCSEs will be more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies have found that English schools devote less time to mathematics – 116 hours a year or 3 hours less a week during sessions than most countries.
Australian schools provide students with an average of 143 hours a year, compared with 138 hours in Singapore.
While there would be no formal need to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that extensive mathematics was likely to encourage schools to provide additional teaching by combining the GCSE-League table with subjects for greater weight.
This course will focus more on “real world problems” including financial mathematics.
The Supreme Court refused to stop the media reporting.
The Supreme Court said that it cannot ask the media not to report information received from the police or any other source.
Asaram's lawyer said that Asaram is being called as a 'dracula' in the case.
There is a guideline for reporting in this case but it is not being followed.
On this, the Supreme Court said that you have many more remedies that can be used.
Asaram's lawyer said there are thousands of newspapers and 100 news channels across the country, but there are two channels in particular, which makes him more trouble.
These people are damaging their image and reporting unilaterally.
In this case, the right of Asaram should be protected.
The court refused to restrain the media from reporting, but told Asaram's lawyer that he had other legal remedies that he could use.
Pawan Bansal, who was surrounded by questions from the opposition at the railway gate, put the opposition in a position by saying that he had not seen any woman in 15 years.
After this, everyone was surprised where the woman’s story came from in the middle.
Perhaps Bansal was referring to the domestic relations of a senior BJP leader and a councillor.
Later, turning the matter around, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had hatched a conspiracy to make a complaint by putting a woman behind him during the last parliamentary elections, which did not succeed.
Talking to reporters, Bansal said that he has been questioned by the CBI in the railway bribery case.
If they were to be made witnesses in the case, would they have been made only after full investigation?
Bansal said that in the booth scam he was talking about, he must have written a letter to only one needy person.
If they are guilty, they will be punished for their sins.
He said though the corporation did not have the constitutional right to raise the issue in the House, he himself asked the opposition to speak.
He said that as far as development works are concerned, the opposition will be given a list of development works for 15 years.
They cannot even think about the way Chandigarh is being developed or is going to be developed.
The two exchanged greetings at the Cabinet meeting.
At the end of the meeting, Singh praised the Chief Minister's speech for the counter-attack on Narendra Modi at Chintan Shivir.
He also said in his speech that there is no other feeling in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges need to be tackled.
The Chief Minister had the same impression on his face that he took Singh's speech in a positive way.
Singh had urged the Chief Minister to give respect to workers at Chintan Shivir and protect them from alleged harassment of officers.
However, he had also said that he was ready to be sacked from the cabinet to make his point.
However, after the emerging opinion in the Chintan camp, there is a possibility of a fresh idea in the matter of putting workers in government posts.
State JD(U) president Vashisht Narayan Singh said that the party would soon announce the names of its workers in the 20-point committee.
His sign was also that the list was almost ready.
It is being reported that now Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will inspect the list from his own level.
They will also examine whether the opinion of MLAs-MPs has been taken in making the list.
If needed, the list will be extensively revised to accommodate old and committed workers.
The MLAs and MPs have alleged that their views were not taken in making the list of nominations.
The names of those who came much later from other parties have been included in the list, while many important activists active since the days of the Samata Party have been neglected.
Some people are born with silver spoons, some make life ideal by their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One such personality is late Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Heerachand Goverdhandas Ambani, was born on December 28, 1932, as a teacher at a school in Chorwad, a small village in Gujarat.
Of the five siblings, Dhirubhai was the third.
The five children of the family are Ramniklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumati.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to drop out of school after high school.
Dhirubhai started helping the family financially in his childhood.
At this time they used to set up a Bhaji shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists who came here.
Talking about Dhirubhai's first job, in 1949 at the age of 17, he reached the city of Aden in Yemen on a ship called Cabota.
Here his elder brother Ramniklal had made all the arrangements for him, so he did not have any problem in getting a job abroad.
But something else was going on in Dhirubhai 's mind.
In 1954, they came back.
In 1955, with Rs 500 in his pocket, he tried his luck in Mumbai.
This is where his professional journey began.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took such a step that he never looked back.
His name was not only known in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
He was the owner of 62000 crores at this time.
Currently, his sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are in charge of his kingdom.
Like his father, these two brothers are also among the names of international businessmen today.
Who does not know the Ambani family today?
Ambani is survived by his wife Nita Ambani, son Anil Ambani and two sons, Dhirubhai Ambani and Mukesh Ambani.

Similarly, the committee has not given a green signal to increase the tax on electrical goods like transmission wires, saying that it may affect the general public due to the cost of electricity.
The committee has also not considered the proposal to impose a green tax on the renewal of commercial vehicles.

SRINAGAR: The security cover of former minister Ghulam Hassan Khan, who joined the Congress from the People's Democratic Party (PDP), has been reportedly withdrawn by the police.
Khan blamed the state government for this, saying his security had been withdrawn for political reasons.
Ghulam Hassan Khan Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, who won the 2002 election on a PDP ticket from Shopian, was part of his cabinet when he was chief minister.
Ghulam Hassan Khan said that I have got the security cover since 1996.
I live in a country that is run by terrorists.
A security team of CRPF was deployed at my house under the leadership of a sub-inspector.
I have bodyguards with me, but all my security was suddenly withdrawn on Veerwar.
When the security team was going from my house, I spoke to the Deputy Commissioner and the District SP.
But instead of restoring security, he only said he would investigate the matter.
However, when contacted, Kashmir Inspector General of Police Abdul Gani Mir denied any knowledge of the matter, saying it was a sensitive matter.
I myself will investigate how the security of a former minister and a senior political leader has been removed.
State Congress chief Prof. Saifuddin Soz said that there is no such thing in my knowledge.
If Hasan Khan's security has been compromised, it is a very serious matter.
I am currently in Jammu and I am coming to Kashmir in the next couple of days.
I will discuss this issue with the concerned administration.
According to the report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore in the last four years to celebrate Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
Contrary to Modi's claims, there was a period during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's tenure as prime minister (between 1999 and 2004) when no advertisement was issued by the government on Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002)
While laying the foundation stone of the 182-metre tall 'Statue of Unity' of Sardar Patel at Kevadiya in Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, "There was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's Jayanti earlier.
While DAVP records show that the UPA has spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's advertisements.
When asked about Modi's claims, Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari said the BJP's PM candidates do not talk on the basis of facts.
The UPA could not bring any advertisement on Patel in 2008.
He said this happened because of the economic slowdown that year.
However, the amount spent on the advertisements of Sardar Patel is much less than the amount spent on the birth and death anniversaries of the Nehru-Gandhi family members every year
The DAVP spent Rs 33 crore on print advertisements for the birth anniversary and death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Rs 21 crore for former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru.
When Manish Tewari was asked about the difference, he said, It should not be seen from the point of view of spending on advertising.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, including the size of the advertisement or the rate of the advertisement for that year, etc.
The real thing is that it shows our dedication, which those who oppose it are trying to take over the legacy of a great leader without even knowing about it.
Today, he will meet the families of those killed in the Patna rally last Sunday.
Tight security arrangements have been made in view of Narendra Modi's visit to Patna a week after the blast.

People attending the meetings will be monitored by the police.
The Gujarat Police Force, NSGIB and the state police will keep a close watch on the security.
Modi's security cover will be tightened.
Meanwhile, questions have also been raised over the BJP's bone kalash yatra, which has been taken out for those killed in the Patna blast.
Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has accused the BJP of trying to destabilise the state.
Moving through soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical care
Dr.George Well is delivering free healthcare to the rural areas of Cameroon
Wells and his team see hundreds of patients on almost every weekend
West African countries do not have too many physicians; there is only one physician for 5,000 people.
Give your vote here or via mobile
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in the year 2013.
You can vote for him or for someone in the other top 10 to become the hero of the year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his exceptional work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his ailing father, fainting and fainting, going to the hospital, who was not properly equipped to help him.
Jameel Welle was injured in a car accident near the Cameroonian capital of Yonde in 1981.
Initially, only his hand was broken, but an infection spread to his brain, and he developed hemorrhaging, which affected the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” says Georges Well.
If we had the money, we would take our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Vall took his father to the overcrowded clinics and hospitals and received whatever treatment he could get.
"It's not easy," Wells said.
You leave home at 5 in the morning with the hope that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but this does not happen.
There are a lot of patients there.
Some people can wait until death.
The situation hasn't changed much since Well's father's death in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
There is one physician for every 413 people in the United States.
And even if there are doctors there, not many Cameroonians can afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and the private sector accounts for nearly two-thirds of healthcare spending in the country.
“Their only problem is poverty,” says Welle.
And being poor, they cannot enjoy their life.
Seeing the pain of his father and his countrymen, Vail resolved to resolve some of it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He himself became a physician, and began working as a vascular surgeon at the Centre Hospital in Juneday.
And he started the non-profit organization Escowim, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and about 30 people sit in a van, tie medical supplies to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical care.
Sometimes luck is not with them.
They have to push the vehicle forward more than once by pushing it through rivers and soil.
But when they arrive, they get a truly heroic honor: feasting, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the community can offer.
Free medical care in these villages is indeed a reason to celebrate, and Wells – with its big smile and endless energy – happily joins in.
The next morning, his team begins to meet with hundreds of patients.
"We're meeting 500 people in each trip," said Well.
They come from a distance of about 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
All of these weekend clinics offer a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, donated glasses or a free birth certificate -- this document is required at school, but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with spatial anesthesia.
The operations are usually carried out in the school building, town hall, or at home; after the procedure, the patient walks to the place of recovery, and makes room for the next person.
The group's generator lights up the operation room and sanitizing equipment, and Well and his volunteers work up early on Sundays.
It is a slow pace, but the village musicians usually help keep the party motivated.
"They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and keep us going," said Well.
On Sunday his team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group, which includes Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, performed 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their help can change the world for the people they help.
One person said that due to free hernia surgery, he will be able to go back to work.
He said, "That will change the fate of me and my family."
In addition to running a weekend clinic and working as a surgeon in a hospital, Well also works at a private medical clinic around the compound at night.
He explained that this is his second job that finances 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is completed by private donations.
"I don't know when they sleep," said Katy O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Well's group.
They are always either in the hospital, or trying to make money for their organization, so that they keep running these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Well's campaign, this is an experimental opportunity that they can never achieve in their own country.
"We have been able to gain experimental experience in the surgical procedures that we use to help Dr. Wel capture tools or clean blood stains," said O'Malley.
As a second-year medical student in the U.S. you will never have the opportunity to do so.
Voluntary students usually spend their money to reach Cameroon, and they often come with donated medical supplies.
But after they reach the compound, they have to go and live, and the cost of the instructions is well worth it.
"There's no doubt they're heroes," says O'Malley.
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon will never end.
For Well, almost the same workload, there is no difficulty.
Helping other people live happy lives, fulfilling the promise they made to their father, these are the things that bring them a lot of joy.
"I'm very happy when I'm doing this job," says Well.
And I think of my father.
I hope they see what I'm doing.
I’m doing this to make people laugh, to ease their pain.

You won't believe it, but it's true.
Not only this, Mission Road has been named after Municipal Councilor Anjali Kumari.
In fact, the Jharkhand Vikas Yuva Morcha has named it to express its displeasure over some of the deteriorating roads in the city.
The function was presided over by JMM Central Secretary Sachidanand Pandey.
"Addressing a rally, Modi said, ""You look at the speeches of Congress or UPA leaders in the last two months, then you will find that they don't talk about what they have done."
“The Congress has become so arrogant that it does not answer media questions,” he said.
Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government is, yet he needs answers from Modi.
It is your duty to answer to the people.
Clearly, Modi was responding to Sibal, who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants an environment under his control where he delivers his speech and does not talk to journalists to avoid questions.
Sibal also challenged Modi to have a face-to-face debate.
“I promise the people of the country that when the BJP forms the government in 2014, we will present a report to the people every year,” Modi said.
The Congress has re-nominated all its MLAs.

Obama's health care bill has been rejected.
Amid a flurry of criticism, President Obama yesterday retracted his often-repeated misleading promise that “you can continue if you like your health plan.”
With millions of people receiving cancellation information from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president for misleading U.S. citizens in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama changed his real message.
He said in a speech in Boston that "a lot of people who have health insurance, and that's useful, can continue to have it."
Addressing what he calls the "news flash" of the repeal, Obama has graced the American citizens who receive these information to buy new coverage in the market.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, just as much money or even a comprehensive healthcare plan cheaper than the proposed one.
"You'll find a better deal," he said.
It should come as no surprise that 5 per cent of the population who buy insurance with their own money may be forced to change their plans as their coverage does not conform to the desired standards under the Affordable Care Act, the administration said.
In a statement before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, Sebelius said, "I tell these American citizens directly, you deserve better than that."
Sebelius, who is taking responsibility for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online market since October has been "unfortunate."
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as other people," he said.
I want to regain your trust again.
Sebelius said the sentence angrily to a fellow sitting behind him at a House hearing yesterday after a heated argument with Republicans. Billy Long, R-Mo about whether he would need to be nominated for Obamacare.
In a more than three-hour-long hearing, Long repeatedly asked Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily abandon government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through healthcare.gov, which she is now selling to millions of Americans.

As a result, the number of violations of the Code of Conduct has come down.
As many as 313 cases were registered against various political parties till October 21 since the model code of conduct came into force on October 4.
From October 22 to October 27, only 31 cases have been registered.
With the introduction of the election code of conduct, cases of its violation also started coming up.
In the early days, there were more complaints, but gradually it has started decreasing.
It is being told that in the early days, there were more complaints against political parties due to lack of complete information about the code of conduct.
With the Election Commission making political parties aware and taking lessons from the recorded case, there are fewer complaints now.
Many parties were campaigning as before due to lack of information, but when action was taken against them, they stopped it.
Political parties are following the model code of conduct while getting information about it.
This also reduces the number of violations.
A proposal in this regard has been sent to the government by the ADA, which is going to be sealed soon.

In an unexpected confession, John Kerry said the U.S. spying had "inappropriately gone too far"
John Kerry has signaled the softening of the U.S. protective attitude to its surveillance program by unexpectedly admitting that its spying sometimes "inappropriately goes too far."
The Minister of State has also admitted that he is also guilty of being on an "automatic pilot" with Barack Obama in the case of being on an insurgent disclosure to informant Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities.
This revelation has brought the U.S. government to a diplomatic chasm in relations with its allies.
Speaking via video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no question that the president, me, and others in the government were really aware of some of the things that happened to the automatic pilot, because looking back, World War II, and the difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11 had its potential.
They have become the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to acknowledge that U.S. espionage has crossed its limits, but insist that no one’s rights have been abused.
He said: “In some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately.”
And the President is determined to try to make it clear to the people and is currently conducting a thorough review so that no one gets a sense of abuse.
I assure you that there is nothing wrong with innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry emphasized that, however, the NSA was striving for a good cause, and its surveillance work has saved many lives.
He further explained that: “We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves up.”
There is radical extremism in the world, which is committed to killing people and blowing them up and attacking governments.
So what's the problem if you're able to stop it before it happens?
We've actually saved the plane from falling, buildings collapsing, and people being killed because we've been able to figure out what others are planning in advance.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said U.S. lawmakers would travel to Europe to help address overseas concerns about so-called U.S. espionage, and try to convince European countries about the need to continue joint anti-corruption efforts with the U.S.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he has spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and is concerned about threats by the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop their participation in anti-terror organizations due to their frustration over surveillance.
"It's really important for the U.S. national security interests that European countries stand with us in the context of our counterterrorism efforts," Murphy, who was first elected to the Democratic Party and chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview with Washington.
To make it clear to European countries that we need to continue to work together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA program.
Reports of the NSA recording millions of phone conversations in Europe have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said the reports were not entirely accurate, and showed a misunderstanding of the metadata shared by NATO allies with the United Nations.
Other disclosures in documents leaked by Snowden reveal that the NSA has monitored the cellphones of 34 other top leaders of the world, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper has defended the spying incident on allies as necessary and said it is common for both sides to do so.
Amid the ruckus, Murphy said his office was arranging a Congress visit which is likely to take place this year, and expressed hope that the delegation would include members from both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating law makers will be released in the coming days.
He said that work on the travel schedule is still going on.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he said some “impractical relationships” would also have to be sacrificed.
He said European leaders must also be honest with their people about their spying programs used over the years.
“While we can modify our surveillance program to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Kerry is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend, where he will address a range of issues ranging from U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran to U.S. surveillance activities.
A new policy of board change in municipalities has begun.
Recently, the Trinamool was converted into the Board of the Congress leadership in the municipality of Saithia in Veerbhum district due to the change of the party's board councillors.
The change came as most of the Congress councillors, including the municipal chairman, joined the Trinamool.
Not only the Congress, but some councillors of CPI(M), CPI and Forward Bloc have also taken control of the TMC here.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy considers it a good sign for the party.
He said 10 Congress councillors, including Saithia municipality chairman Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Viplav Dutta, joined the Trinamool.
Some councillors of the Left Front, including the CPI(M), have also adopted the Trinamool flag.
All of them have written to the district magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of the Trinamool and according to the strength of numbers, the Cythia Municipal Board has also come under the control of the Trinamool.
Rai also claimed that everyone agrees with the roadmap for Bengal's development under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties, including the Congress, CPI(M), CPI, and Forward Bloc, are gearing up to join the Trinamool Congress.
We welcome the leaders of any party in the Trinamool Congress.
The Trinamool's capture of the municipal board is considered crucial in political circles as the Congress corporators have switched sides in the Santhia municipality ahead of the November 22 polls to five municipalities.
Earlier, the Left Front-ruled Haldia and the Congress-ruled Palika Board in Nadia were also examples of the Trinamool taking over.
When the Trinamool takes over the municipal board in the districts due to party changes, those who join the party receive a grand welcome at the Trinamool Bhavan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy is excited to break away from other parties and join the Trinamool.
"Those who break away from any party are welcome in the Trinamool,"" he said."
They claim that peoples faith in the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is increasing, as a result of which people want to join the Trinamool.
However, the main opposition party CPI(M) says lower-level leaders of other parties are being intimidated.
People are joining it fearing the terror of Trinamool Congress.
The CPI(M) sees the change in the board of elected local bodies as a blow to democracy.
In a democratic way, any party has the right to increase its base of people, but it is necessary to question the legitimacy of the change in power.
Australian woman appeals against Thai jail term
A 21-year-old Sydney woman has been sentenced to 15 days in jail in Phuket for falsely accusing a taxi driver of assaulting her.
On June 15, the Phuket provincial court found Stevie Rochelle Bomford guilty of making false charges against the Thai police, alleging that on Sunday morning, June 10, a local taxi driver, along with two other people, tried to stop him.
But later CCTV footage showed that she had returned to the hotel safely after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
After two days of questioning by Phuket police, Bamford agreed to tell the story.
He was taken to a local police station before being produced before the court.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket instead of an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has requested the Foreign Affairs Department in Canberra to assist her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was "extremely concerned" about their daughter's care and wanted to bring her back to Australia.
"Of course it has been a worrying time for us, but we hope she will be back home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamphode has appealed against the sentence order, and has been granted bail on 50,000 Baht.
During this time, reports in Australia said that she was vacationing at the holiday resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand said Bamford's case was being contested by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that as a result of the appeal, the court could extend his sentence to two years and force him to stay in an adult prison.
In the wake of the recent killing of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also plead guilty in an attempt to improve its poor tourist image.
