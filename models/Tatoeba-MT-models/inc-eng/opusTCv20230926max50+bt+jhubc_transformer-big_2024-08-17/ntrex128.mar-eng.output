Welch Am Not Worried About ‘Looking Like Muppets’
Some AMs are skeptical about the suggestion to change their title to MWP (Welsh Member of Parliament).
This is due to the change of the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Many political parties are worried about this change.
A Labour AM said his group was concerned about the title "feels like Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, TWP means fool and PwP means faecal matter.
A plaid AM said that the entire group is "narrative" and suggested options.
A Welsh Conservative said its group was "open-minded" about the name change, but noted that from MWP to Muppet was a short-lived verbal harassment.
In this context, the Welsh alphabet is pronounced the same way as the Yorkshire English U.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce a name change, said: "The final decision on any description of what names to name the members of the Assembly will, of course, be left to the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 grants the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published public consultation consultations on these proposals, which showed widespread support for the Assembly to name a Welsh Parliament.
In the case of AM's title, the Commission favoured neither the Welsh Parliament Member nor the WMP, but, the MWP option received the most support in public consultation.
AMs are suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could be a headache for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to present a draft law on changes in a few weeks.
The Act on Amendments will include other changes in the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on disqualifications of AMs and the structure of the Committee system.
I will take a final vote on the question of which name to address them when they discuss this law.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum is aimed at resolving the decades - long dispute with Greece, its own province of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is akin to representing its territory, and that members of the EU and NATO have consistently objected to its efforts to give it up.
Macedonia's President Georg Ivanov is a staunch opponent of the name change.
But, along with Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, supporters of the referendum claim that the name change is the only cost to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells were silenced as the churches in Harlem clashed
"Historically, the older people I spoke to thought there was a bar and a discussion at every corner," Adams said.
"Today, there is none of that."
He said it was obvious that the bar was empty.
"People come together in different ways today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of neighborhoods where people go on a regular basis."
In the case of churches, they worry that the money coming from the sale of property will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point."
He added that the church could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with people who didn't help with the neighborhood's remaining shelters.
"The majority of people who buy condoms in these buildings will be white," he said, "and so the time for this church to be completely closed will come soon because the majority of people who come to live in these condoms are unlikely to be members of this church."
Both churches were built by groups of white people before Harlem became a black metropolis - the metropolitan community - in 1870, a decade after St. Martin's.
The original group of white Methodists came out in the 1930s.
The building was owned by a group of black people who were praying nearby.
A group of blacks took control of St. Martin under Rev. John Howard, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, was the main route of shopping in Harlem, and they opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
The building was heavily damaged in a fire in 1939, but Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, starting the Carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin, proudly named the carillon "the bells of the poor".
In July, experts who played the carillon referred to it as "a cultural treasure" and "an amazing historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first carillon in the world to be played by a black man, Dionisio A. Lind, who made his debut 18 years ago in a much larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Maryveder submitted that St. Martin did not transfer him.
What happened in St. Martins over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, brought in by church leaders to some extent, and the rest by Episcopal Diocese.
The Vestry – the parish’s board of directors, was made up of general leaders – he wrote Diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would attempt to delegate “costs” to the Vestry, although the architects and contractors sent by Diocese were not involved.
Some parishioners complained that there was a lack of transparency in favour of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark on a lobster drive in California.
Officials said a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday as he made his way to the lobster on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place at 7 a.m. off the coast of Bikinis in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that when he was swimming with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, he heard a boy screaming for help and went to him with a group and helped him get out of the water.
Hamlin said that at first she thought it was a joke to catch the lobster, but then she realized "he was screaming, he took my tea!"
I've got my cheese!"
"He's got the whole world in his hands," said Hamlin, after he had saved the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's shark in the water!'" Hamlin said.
The boy was airlifted to Ready Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is said to be critical.
The shark species responsible for the attack could not be identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
The boy suffered severe injuries on the upper part of his body, police said.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Panto Beach in Casablad to Swamis in Esinitas for 48 hours due to security reasons.
There are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
The UK is preparing to enter the beauty market
The Sansbury Department Store-style Beauty Oils is pitting Boots, SuperDrugs and Debenhams by hiring expert assistants.
As part of the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn cosmetics market, as fashion and homeware sales continue to decline as the market continues to grow, more large beauty aisles will be tested across 11 stores across the country and taken to more stores next year if successful.
Investing in cosmetics comes as supermarkets look for ways to use shelf space that was once used by TVs, microwaves, and homewares.
Sensbury said it will double the number of its cosmetics to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Assy, Tweezersman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space in branded areas found in stores such as boots.
This supermarket is also relaunching its butic makeup range so that most products are vegan-friendly – there is an increased demand for this from young buyers.
Apart from this, the fragrance shop will also be offering discounts at two Sensbury stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in South London, while the second will open later this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
The trend towards online shopping and buying a small amount of food every day in local convenience stores means supermarkets have to do a lot to attract people to you.
Mike Kup, chief executive of Sensbury, said that while these outlets will increasingly look like department stores, supermarket chains are trying to counter Aldi and Liddell customers with more services and non-food items.
Sensbury has been setting up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also launched a number of habbits since they bought both of these chains two years ago, which, according to them, have made the acquisitions more profitable as they have been successful in increasing grocery sales.
The previous attempts to reshape our beauty and pharmacy departments had failed.
Sensbury tested a joint venture with Boots in 2000, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to split income from chemist stores in its supermarkets.
The new policy comes after Sensbury sold its 281-store pharmacy business to the owners of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, Celesio, for <0xC2><0xA3>125m three years ago.
He said Lloyds will play a role in the scheme by incorporating a wide range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Pose and Wichita, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Censbury's, commercial director, says: "We've changed the look of our beauty oils to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be ready to give advice.
Our range of brands is tailored to every need, and because of the attractive environment and convenient location, we are one of the most attractive beauty spots challenging the old buying method."
Peter Jones 'broken' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
TV presenter Holly Willoughby has cancelled a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV, triggering Dragons den star Peter Jones.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for your homeware and accessories brand Truely.
This business is compared to Paltrow's secret brand in Guyana.
This morning, the 37-year-old said on Instagram that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby stepped out of her lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute to instigate Dragons Den star Peter Jones – and is focused on her new massive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, the popular TV star admitted in a tense meeting at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that her new deals - worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to focus on her homewares and accessories brand Truly.
The business is compared to Paltrow's Gup brand in Guyana, and it is estimated that Bilobi's wealth will double to <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, announced his exit from Instagram, Jones exited the UK by jet and moved to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Holi has been at the top of the priority list so far.
This would have been her long - term future which would have made her successful over the next couple of decades.
Everyone was surprised by her decision to leave.
No one could have predicted what would happen on Tuesday.
There's a warehouse full of items at Marlow headquarters that's ready to sell."
According to experts, the exit of one of Britain's most trusted stars, the huge investment in various products, ranging from morning dew, cushions to candles and clothing to homeware, will hurt the firm's millions, and its start is likely to be further delayed.
This could be the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby and Dan Baldwin, a mother of three, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for the past 10 years.
With Willoughby Cap and Jones, Truely was founded in 2016 and the 52-year-old Jones joined in March as president.
The couple spend a vacation together, and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin as the host of I&A Celebrity of ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We're not going to comment on these business developments."
"We fell in love, and then we fell in love"
Some have called it "unbecoming of the president" and ridiculed the media's comments about being so positive about North Korea's president.
"Why did President Trump give up so much?"
Trump used the term "news anchor."
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim is looking forward to a second meeting after Trump praised the initial meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward denuclearization of the North Korean peninsula.
But the disarmament negotiations have come to a halt.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the move to denuclearize North Korea does not appear to have a “consistent response” from the United States.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions to keep up the pressure.
In his speech, Trump expressed a more optimistic view.
"We have a very good relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Lakhs of people were killed.
Now we've got our magic."
Our efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: rocket tests have stopped, rescues are helping, and the rest of the U.S. personnel are coming home.
And he supported his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but it's better to have about 200 people here than 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded place," Trump said, pointing a finger at the crowd that was in front of him.
An island was destroyed by a tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia, hundreds of people died
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were no longer needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been moved elsewhere, no national disaster has been declared, which is a precondition for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, he made it very clear that we're not asking for international help, so it's a bit challenging," Ms Sumbang said.
Save the Children is forming a team to go to Palau, while it is not yet clear whether foreign employees can work in the actual location.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities were studying the situation in Palu to see if foreign entities could be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts.
Due to the continuous earthquake in Indonesia, this country is very less prepared to deal with the impact of nature.
Although tsunami shelters are built in Esseh, they are not easily found on other shorelines.
Although a warning has been issued earlier, there is a possibility of loss of life due to the absence of a tsunami warning sirens in Palu.
It is difficult to travel between many islands of Indonesia in good times.
Natural disasters make it more difficult to get help.
A hospital ship set up to treat earthquake victims in Lombok is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has been at the centre of a campaign to improve Indonesia's devastated infrastructure, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is facing financial supply shortfalls, including the challenge of re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from long-standing ethnic tensions in Indonesia, in which members of the Muslim majority have chosen a more narrow faith path.
Christian and Muslim gangs used axes, arrows and bows, and other village weapons, fighting on the streets killed more than 1,000 people and displaced thousands from their homes.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Stiriz equalises against Chelsea
Daniel Stiriz scored a point in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday to save Liverpool from Chelsea's defeat in the Premier League.
Stryz's team was trailing -1-0 when he received a pass from Sherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards out of Chelsea's goal.
He tapped the ball to his left and then picked up a shot to the far post.
His attempt went high in the box and fell into the top corner of the net on the right.
The ball eventually went over Kepa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
"He was just trying to get into that position, get on the ball and always play forward as much as possible, so I tried to get as much time for myself as possible," Stierson told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I watched Kent come in and touch it once and didn't think much about it and just took a shot."
Chelsea were 1-0 up at half-time after receiving a point in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
At that time, the Blues striker sent a pass back to Matteo Kovacic, then picked up near midfield and ran into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic quickly gave-and-go on the midfield.
Then he took a deep breath and went to the bathroom.
Hazzard broke the defence line and saw Liverpool's Alison Baker, who ended his innings with a single shot in the left leg in the far post.
Liverpool will play the Champions League group stage match at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 3 pm on Wednesday.
Chelsea will take on Videoton in the UEFA Europa League in London on Thursday at 3 pm.
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from the Indonesia earthquake and tsunami rose to 832 on Sunday, the country's disaster agency said.
Several people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of buildings hit by the 7.5-magnitude quake on Friday and waves of up to 20 feet high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the organisation, told a news conference.
In the city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, the buildings lying there are now littered with debris.
A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of killing a woman
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Burbankhead, Merseyside.
A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of killing a 44-year-old woman who was found dead at 7.55 am on John Street with gunshot wounds.
The police have appealed to the people of the area to come forward if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "This investigation is in its early stages, but I urge anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Berkhead to contact us if they have seen or heard anything suspicious.
I would appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who have anything to do with the dashcam footage, to contact us as they may have the necessary information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman who was killed was a resident of Burbankhead and that her body was found inside a building.
A friend of hers came to the scene this afternoon and asked where she was found.
An investigation is under way and the families of the deceased are being informed.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Meeves was trying to enter his flat, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was silent when he realized what had happened.
Residents were told that they would be re-entering the building after several hours.
A police officer said that the entire area has been declared a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, she was crying.
She said repeatedly, "It's terrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon and the other van was on the outside.
Several officers were standing inside the barricade and monitoring the block of flats.
If anyone has any information, they should give it to DM <0x40>MerPolCC or call 101 or contact Crimestoppers by mentioning log 247 of 30th September on anonymous 0800 555 111.
Cromwells statue in Parliament is the latest monument to the controversy over the rewriting of history
If he were to be removed, it would be like giving a poetic justice, because the purged followers of his fiery head have led to the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was a travesty that Oliver Cromwell's image outside the Palace of Westminster would be tarnished by the ongoing controversy over the removal of statues.
The English Civil War was not fought by Cromwell, nor was it won by him.
Perhaps the wrong chromavel would be sacrificed for the actions of their ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent description of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornecroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and is part of the historical account of this personality, which many believe is still venerated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "In the opinion of many, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, Cromwell was, in the opinion of many, a pro-Parliament in comparison to external pressure, in his case, of course of the monarchy.
Whether this description is absolutely accurate has consistently been the subject of historical debate.
One thing is for sure, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the later development of our country, and Cromwell is a personally identifiable figure who represents one side of that valley.
His performance as Lord Protector is also celebratory and memorable."
The Great Wall of China was built by the Chinese peasants
Local media have reported that a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
The South China Morning Post said on Sunday that the man's surname was "Yuan," and that his blood vessel was found in a broken condition, lying in a pool of blood at the Lipanshui market in Guizhou province.
On May 30, 2005, a farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a Hogari in Xi'an, Qinghai Province, China.
It is said that he had come with his cousin to sell 15 pigs in this market from the nearby Yunnan province.
The next morning, his cousin was found dead, and he found the door of the nearby pigs cage open.
He said there was a large blood vessel in the man's body.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig had been strangled to death by the farmer.
"My cousin's feet were bloodied and confused," said another brother, whose surname was "Woo," according to Guiyang Ewing News.
According to security camera footage, Yuan entered the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed him did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Iving News that he had been locked in order not to attack anyone with the pig, and police were collecting evidence from the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Though this incident is rare, the occasions of attack by pigs on humans have been recorded earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig dragged a Welsh farmer to his track by his wife.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but the taste of blood can "advance" them.
"They're just playing.
They're very smart, they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to respect them," he said.
The storm is expected to cause widespread rainfall in the western United States.
According to forecasts, the intensity of the Rosa storm is decreasing as it moves over more cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
It is expected to rain in the next few days in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Ros<0xC3><0xA9>'s wind speed was 85 miles per hour at 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, meaning it is a Category 1 hurricane and is 385 kilometers southwest of Punta Yugoslavia.
It is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a balloon is beginning to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and is heading eastwards towards the US West Coast. As a tropical storm approaches the Rosa Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will begin to push deep temperate humidity northwards into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Later, along with the upcoming balloons, the temperate moisture will combine and cause widespread heavy rainfall in the south-west in the coming days.
At the local level, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous floods, debris will flow and there is a possibility of landslides in the desert.
Due to deep temperate humidity, the rainfall will remain 2 to 3 inches per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
The southwest, in particular, is expected to receive 2 to 4 inches of rain over most parts of Arizona.
The sudden floods are likely to be accompanied by rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the dispersal of temperate rainfall.
It is very dangerous to go out in the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
The heavy rains can make the canyons into rivers that can be filled with dust and strong winds at the local level.
The storm is expected to bring heavy rain to parts of southern California.
More than half an inch of rain is possible, so light amounts of debris can flow and roads will be slippery.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
Some light rain will arrive in Arizona late on Sunday and Monday morning, followed by late on Monday and widespread on Tuesday.
Heavy rain is expected to continue through Tuesday and into Wednesday.
As the Arctic gets colder, there may be some sharp fluctuations in temperature in October, but the temperate part will remain very hot.
This causes a dramatic change in temperature over a short period of time.
Sunday is a great example of a dramatic change in temperature in Central America.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will rise again and expand.
A hot start is expected in early October from the southern plateau over much of the central and eastern United States, with widespread to northeastern parts with 80 degrees.
Temperatures in New York City are expected to hit 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the normal.
According to our long-term weather forecast, temperatures are likely to be higher than the average for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks, the emotional testimony given on Thursday by Supreme Court-appointed Brad Kavanaugh and the woman who allegedly sexually assaulted him in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, continuing the political stalemate, broadcasters broke the regular schedule by sidelining it at the last minute on Friday: an agreement brokered by Arizon Sen: FBI's Jeff Flake will run the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had caught him drunk at a high school party and tried to take his clothes off.
Kevin, in a very emotional testimony, said that he was 100% sure that nothing like this had happened.
More than 20.4 million people are likely to have seen the witness on Friday, Nelson said.
The company is counting the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data from other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, that showed the event was not immediately available.
And Nelson usually has some problems in counting the number of people he sees in offices.
In this sense, the number is the same as the number of spectators for a playoff football match or an Academy Award.
A strong supporter of Kavanaugh's appointment, the Fox News Channel took the lead on all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, during the day's hearings, Nelson said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
After the hearing, the curiosity subsided.
Friday's game was a focus of interest.
After the Central Republican office issued a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, he was briefly handcuffed by the cameras of CNN and CBS as protesters chanted against him on Friday morning as he was on his way to the Judiciary Committee hearings in Geneva.
He stood with his eyes closed for several minutes, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," she said.
Do you think they are telling the truth?
She said, "You have all the power.
Fleck said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator was shut down, he said he had more to say at the committee's hearing.
When the Judiciary Committee was due to vote to send Kevin's nomination for the vote to the entire Senate, cable and broadcast networks made all the broadcasts several hours later.
But Fleck said he would only do so on the basis of the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the appointment next week, which the minority Democrats are urging.
Flake was partially convinced by his conversations with Mitt, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After discussions with Koons and several senators, Fleck made his decision.
Flake's choice had power, as it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without scrutiny.
The FBI has opened an investigation into President Trump's allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "politics"
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union "politicizing" Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party summit in Birmingham, UK, on September 20, 2018.
In one of his other interviews on the cover of the newspaper, his former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson oversaw his alleged Checkers' plan for Brexit, proposing that Britain and the EU collect each other's taxes is "completely incredible."
Deadly shooting: Police arrest Dayton Simpson, suspect in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old basketball player Weedy Sims at LSU.
The 20-year-old Ditton Simpson was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
A video of the fight between Sims and Simpson was released by authorities, and police said that Sims glasses were missing in the clash.
CBS affiliate WAFB reported that police seized the glasses from the scene and said it contained Simpson's DNA.
After questioning, the accused confessed to killing the woman, police said.
Prosecutors said the bond amount was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying the man died of a gunshot wound to the head.
The department credited the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and residents of the area for assisting in the investigation.
The LSU athletic director, Joe Alva, thanked regional law enforcement agencies for their "in depth and pursuit of justice."
Siems was 20 years of age.
The 6-foot-6-inch-tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He earned an average of 5.6 last season and took 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Wade's death had left the team "devastated" and "shocked."
"It's always a concern," said Wade.
Flooding in Mexico City.
The ash that emanates from the Poketpetal volcano has reached parts of southern Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano's crater after it began to move rapidly, and within 24 hours it had released 183 lots of gas and ash.
A number of businesses and businesses were affected by the closure.
Pictures were circulating on social media showing the windows of a car with a layer of ash in nearby cities such as Shochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysical experts found an increase in activity in the area of the volcano, 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goo" has been active since 1994.
Clashes broke out between police and Catalan separatists ahead of Independence Day.
Six people were arrested after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police in Barcelona, and thousands joined rival protests on the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarization vote on secession.
When riot police stopped a group of masked pro-division supporters, they pelted eggs and colour smog, causing a cloud of dust to gather on the crowded streets of the city.
Later in the day, the police used batons to disperse the crowd.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "Don't forget, don't forgive," while pro-unification supporters chanted "Let Spain live."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries, local media reported.
After the October 1 referendum by the Catalans, which was considered illegal by Madrid, the region was under a one-year period of extraterrestrial tension.
Voters chose in large numbers to be independent, but the number of voters remained low as those opposed to the partition boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop them from voting at polling stations during violent clashes across the region.
Pro-independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to avoid a protest in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take a different path.
Narcissa Termis, 68, an electrician who was part of a divisive protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful of a chance for independence for Catalonia.
Last year we had a good life.
I saw tears of joy in the eyes of my parents while voting, but we are stuck,” he said.
Despite a narrow, yet significant victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain their momentum this year, and many of their popular leaders have either accepted anonymity on their own or are in detention awaiting prosecution for their role in holding a referendum and then declaring independence.
John Pig, a 42-year-old mechanic, gave his opinion on the protest over the phone in support of the police, saying that the struggle was supported by politicians on both sides.
“This fight is getting more and more intense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Jankeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he would contest next year’s European Parliament elections.
"The best way to stand as a candidate for the European elections is to protest the decline in democratic values and our smiles at the Spanish government," he said.
Man arrested for entering car in London
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested for repeatedly entering a car into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballinagrad Crescent at around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Bob Blemings, inspector of the department, said that the entrance and the building were also damaged.
A crossbow was also thrown at the car.
Meng Hao's side won 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Meng scores first goal for Livingston
The Promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers by handing Steven Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as the manager of the iBrexit club.
Gary Holt's men's doubles match ended in a draw with Hibernian in the second round.
Gerrard's team lost the Premiership this season without a win and next Sunday, they will face Hearts, who are eight points behind.
The Rangers will take on Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, who will continue his unbeaten run in the division with six games, has not seen a loss since his coach Holt took the formula from Kenny Mylar last month.
Livingston miss out on a chance to take on the visitors
Holt's team should have taken a long lead before getting points, as their exact margin had put the Rangers in complete trouble.
Scott Robinson struck a circle, but he crawled in front of the goal, then he could only widen his effort after Alan Lithgow moved Craig Holckett's header into the goal.
The host team knew that they could trouble the visitors, so they were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them.
And that's how it became an important milestone.
The Rangers gave a free-kick and Livingston got a free kick. Declan Garreagher and Robinson joined Menga, taking possession of the ball and scoring from the middle of the box.
By that time, the Rangers had maintained their dominance, but the defensive line of the opposition was impenetrable and did not suffer much from goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
The same pattern will remain in the second half, however, Alfredo Morelos had to defend one from Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Alan Maggregore's feet cornered Scott Pitman and Lithgow sent the ball further away from Livingston.
In Livingston's box, the crosses continued to come in and were consistently removed, while two penalty claims - Halket's challenge to substitute player Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were abandoned.
"Anonymous" by Livingston
BBC Scotland's Alasdair LeMont Tony Macaroni at the Arena
A great game and result for Livingston.
He has done much better than expected in terms of performance.
His style of play and players have rarely changed since he came back from the top, but Holt should be given a lot of credit for the way he shaped the team after his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halket played from the heart, leading an excellent defensive line, while Megan continued to annoy Conor Goldson and Joe Voral.
However, the motivation of the Rangers has waned.
As much as they were led by Gerard, they fell short of their standard game.
His last game was a lacklustre – he only struck the local team once – a kind of warning to the Rangers who were in the middle of the talisman.
Ardsley was welcomed into the
On Saturday, the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin.
The visit is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations between NATO-allied countries.
Their differences remained on issues including human rights, media freedom and Turkey's inclusion in the EU.
Later, he went to Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an to open a new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police reported security reasons for not crowding 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan – many of them Kurds – also raised their voices, condemning Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome their country.
The dividing image of these guests, who were considered heroes by some German Turks and avoided as dictators by others, was only reflected in these two demonstrations.
Biker killed in hit-and-run collision with car on Deptford Road
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident, which occurred at about 10:15 BST, took place near the confluence of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics helped, but the cyclist died on the spot.
This is the second accident in a few months after a cyclist was killed in a collision on Children’s Street, about a mile away from Saturday’s crash.
The Metropolitan Police said they were working to identify the dead man and inform his relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been changed and motorists have been advised to avoid those parts.
Six officers injured in riot at Long Lartin jail
Six prison officers were injured after a riot broke out in a very secure men's prison, the prison's office said.
The riot started at HMP Long Martin at 09:30 BST on Sunday and continues.
To deal with the riot, specialist "Tornado" officers have been called, eight prisoners are involved in the riot, and it is limited to one wing.
The officers sustained minor injuries on their faces and were undergoing treatment.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with this incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six persons were injured in the incident.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be sent to the police and will have to spend more time in jail."
There are more than 500 prisoners in the HMP Long Laird, including some of the most dangerous accused in the country.
He was admitted to the hospital in June after being attacked by an inmate.
In October last year, riot officials were called in to handle a serious riot in which employees were attacked with bridge balls.
Cyclone Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash floods (Drought areas likely to benefit)
It is rare for Arizona to be hit by a tropical low pressure strip, but this is likely to happen as next week's Rosa cyclone moves west into the desert with the rest of its power, so there is a risk of a sudden flood.
The National Weather Service has already issued alerts for flash floods in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, along with Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City on Monday and Tuesday.
It is expected to go straight to the Ross Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain coming later on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that "only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained their position or low pressure belt in the 200-mile area of Phoenix since 1950!"
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles within the Arizona border.
As per the latest forecast of National Cyclonic Centre, rainfall of 2 to 4 inches will occur at isolated places over Mogolon Rim of Arizona upto 6 inches.
Other parts of Desert Southwest, including Central Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, while isolated places are likely to receive up to 4 inches of rain.
For those who are out of danger of sudden floods, the rain coming from Rosa will be beneficial as the region has been hit by drought.
Although the flooding is a matter of concern, a little rain may be beneficial as the Southwest is currently facing a drought situation.
According to the U.S. Draught Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing a low-intensity drought, the second-highest category," Weather.com reported.
First, the route of the Rosa cyclone will cross the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa's wind speed on Sunday was a maximum of 85 miles per seven, and it was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and was moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is facing more cold water in the Pacific, reducing its power.
Thus, it is expected to reach Mexico in the form of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
There is a significant risk of flooding as heavy rains can occur throughout parts of Mexico.
"It is expected to rain 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to northwest Sonora, which can even fall up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move as a tropical storm north of Mexico before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning in the form of a tropical low-pressure belt, which will then pass through Arizona and enter the south of Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main crisis due to the impact of Rosa or its balance is that Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest are likely to receive heavy rainfall," the National Hurricane Center said.
The rainfall is likely to cause landslides and landslides in the hilly areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested on murder charges
Three minors and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of trying to kidnap a 16-year-old boy in Somerset.
The minor boy was seen in an injured condition at about 04:00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where his condition was stated to be stable.
A 17-year-old man, an 18-year-old man and a 20-year-old man from Radstock were arrested overnight, Somerset police said.
He appealed to everyone to come forward if they have any mobile footage of the incident.
Trump called Kevan a "selfish, angry" member of the Democratic Party.
"One vote for Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to deny the Democratic Party's callous and provocative behavior," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been "selfish, angry" with the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
In a statement to Congress on Thursday, Mr. Kavanaugh strongly and passionately denied allegations of sexual assault against Christine Blasey Ford when she was a teenager.
Ford also confirmed his allegations in the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people saw the brilliance and quality and courage of Kevin."
"The vote that confirms Judge Kavanaugh is the vote of one of the most successful legal experts of our time, of a judge who has a brilliant career in public service," he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president spoke about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections.
It's been five weeks since one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"I'm not standing, but I'm standing," he said.
That's why I'm fighting big candidates everywhere."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a campaign of "resistance and obstruction."
A senior GOP leadership colleague told CNN that the first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate on Friday.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia is rising
At least 384 people have been killed after a massive wave hit the coasts of Indonesia's Sulawesi island following a massive earthquake and tsunami, officials said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the coast of Palu on Friday for a festival, when waves of six meters (18 feet) high hit the coast, killing many people and destroying everything in the way.
The quake was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"Yesterday, when there was a tsunami threat, people were doing their work on the coast and they did not leave immediately and they died," Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told reporters in Jakarta.
"This tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, docks, houses, everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled at 800 kph (497 mph) through the open sea before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centres in Palu.
Air photographs released by the disaster management agency showed several buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The city was also hit by an earthquake on Saturday.
The quake was felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Institute for Evaluation and Technology Applications (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy generated by Friday's massive earthquake was 200 times more than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The size of the tsunami may have been due to the geography of the city, located at the edge of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the people trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings were found, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that 300 kilometers north of Palu, in the area called Donggla, the death toll and damage could be higher, which was close to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Ngorongoro said there was no information from Dongga that the communication was "completely disrupted."
More than 300,000 people were living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“It’s already a crisis, but the situation can get worse,” it said.
Officials said there was a delay in issuing the warning, but there was widespread criticism on Saturday of Palu not being informed that the tsunami had hit.
In an amateur footage posted on social media, a man is heard warning people on the street below a tsunami warning standing on the top floor of a building.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hit the beach, and buildings and cars were blown away.
The footage could not be immediately confirmed by Reuters.
The earthquake and tsunami disrupted power supply and disrupted communication around the island, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has started sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but rescuers are in dire need of food and other basic supplies, officials said.
The city airport has been reopened only for relief work and will remain closed till October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the rescue center in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from Indonesia's tsunami has risen to 800.
This is very bad.
World Vision personnel have arrived safely in Palu city, where staff have set up tarpaulin shelters in their office premises, and they have seen destruction on the road, Doseba said.
"A lot of houses have been destroyed," he said.
This is very bad.
While relief groups have begun preparing themselves for disaster relief, some have complained that foreign aid workers with extensive experience are being barred from reaching Palu.
According to Indonesia's rules, only foreign funds, supplies and personnel can go there if the disaster site has been declared a national disaster zone.
That hasnt happened yet.
"The teaching is at the provincial level," said Oliya Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government said, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we will open up to international assistance, but that's not the situation yet."
When the second night in Palu came after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing still hope that they will find their loved ones in a miracle as such stories are found in natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled out of the gutter.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's body.
Two paragliders trained by the Indonesian national paragliding team's coach, Gendan Subandeno, are missing for the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month.
The others who were trapped at the Roa Roa hotel were our students, Mandagi said.
As a senior in the paragliding sector, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Kumar said that within hours of the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread to the paragliding community, he had hurriedly sent WhatsApp messages to the participants of the Bich Festival, Palu Competitors.
However, their messages, instead of two blue markings, remained only one faint mark.
"I don't think they got the message," he said.
Thieves take away $26,750 while making money at an ATM in Newport on Levy
The Newport Police Department said the robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink employee on Friday morning while he was paying at an ATM in Newport on Levy.
Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement that the driver was vacating an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to bring in more money.
While he was busy, another man "runs after the Brink's employee" and he ran away with a bag of money for delivery.
Witnesses said they saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not say the exact number of people involved in the incident.
If anyone has any information about his identity, contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kenney West: Rapper has changed his name to
Rapper Kenny West has changed his name.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It was formally called Kenney West."
The 41-year-old West had such a nickname for some time and took the title as a moniker for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his presentation on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album.
Singer Ariana Grande has announced that she will be leaving the show for "emotional reasons."
Just as an abridged version of his current business name, West has previously stated that the term is religiously significant to him.
"I think 'y' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
I am you, you are me, we are you.
This change has been a pure reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion and everything since Kenya.
This album is more a reflection of who we are."
It is one of the most popular names that have changed.
Sean Combs is known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Daddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he likes the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West Coordinator, Jay-Z, has also made similar changes with or without a hyphen and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican presidential candidate Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador on Saturday vowed to “never use military force to mobilise Mexicans.”
Soldiers opened fire on peaceful protesters on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people, during which left-wing student movements originated throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans through monthly subsidies and open more free public universities.
He said young people are turning to criminal gangs due to unemployment and lack of educational opportunities.
U.S. to double A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, investors and AI professional Kai-Fu Li said the U.S. should double the amount of money it spends on research in this area, adding that he has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The U.S. does not have a formal AI policy, while various U.S. government departments have announced AI.
China launched its plan last year, which aims to be No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"The double AI research budget will be a good start, because all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking forward to the next AI revolution," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling the funding will double the chance of achieving the next big breakthrough in AI in the United States.
Lee's book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Hutton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, one of China's most prominent AI companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the highest-ranking American Othello player, and later became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee referred to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would be held, so as to help find the next futurists.
Researchers in the United States have to work hard to get government grants.
"China is not taking away academics, it is taking over corporates," Li said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired eminent personalities from universities to work on AI.
Lee said that the changes in immigration policy will also help the US to strengthen its AI efforts.
"I think the green cards should be automatically issued for the PhD in AI.
China's State Council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
In the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies in the United States provide funding to researchers, China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in educational institutions, but the quality of academic work in China is poor, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a joint artificial intelligence center, where partners from industry and academia will be formed, and the White House announced the setting up of a selection committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
In the case of NSFs, they currently invest more than $100 million annually in AI research.
A US law aimed at creating a national security commission on artificial intelligence has not been approved for several months.
Macedonians voted to change their country's name.
Macedonians voted Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would settle their decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked its membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that its northern neighbor's name is a lien on its territory and that the country's accession to NATO and the EU has been used as a lien.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the name change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that the boycott campaign raised doubts that the number of voters would be at least 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper is: "Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership by agreeing to an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price for Macedonia to pursue admission to institutions such as the EU and NATO, a country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I'm here today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under one roof of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," the 79-year-old said.
Though not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said that they will abide by the result of this opinion to be conclusive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required for the change.
The National Election Commission said there was no irregularity till 1 pm.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 per cent, the same as 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of the registered voters cast their votes.
I've come out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Jose Tanevsky, a 62-year-old voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorika, and their son, Dushko, cast their votes in Sremika, Macedonia on September 30, 2018, in a referendum to change the name of the country, which will open the door for the country to join NATO and the European Union.
In Skopje, in front of the parliament, Vladimir Kvardarkov, a 54-year-old homemaker, is building a small platform and setting up chairs in front of the tents erected for those who boycott the referendum.
"We are on the side of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate with a firm mind, not with the back door," Kavardarkov said.
Our country is poor, but we are self-sufficient.
If they don't want us to accept Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia coordination."
Prime Minister Zhao said that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think a majority of people will support because more than 80 percent of our citizens are supporters of the EU and NATO," he said.
He said that if the result is "yes," then it will be "affirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research said 30 to 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum — a percentage lower than the required figure.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV found that 57 percent of people were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent said they would vote yes.
To be successful, the vote must be 50 per cent or more.
If it fails, it will be the first serious blow to the West-based government's policy that came to power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City made his way through Brighton's defense for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Stirling defeated Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
The goal in the 65th minute was very easy.
This Argentine striker and got a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the order.
He scored three runs from Brighton's defenders before hitting the ground.
He was surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed the ball around a defender and then pushed many people to the side of the Brighton box.
Then he turned to his left, and there was a knock.
The English forward gave the ball back to Aguero using his first touch in the box, using his right boot to pinch Breton keeper Matthew Ryan and shoot him on the right side of the net.
Aguero's foundation has some problems," city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We've been playing for 60 minutes.
That's exactly what happened.
We were lucky to have him at the time."
But Sky Blue took the early lead in the Stirling Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
At that time, Aguero got a ball inside the Brayton area.
He sent the ball to Leroy Sen on the left side in a good way.
Sen took a few catches and then gave the lead towards the Sterling far post.
This Sky Blues forward tapped into the ball net a little before going out of bounds.
In Germany, Hoffenheim will take on Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12:55 p.m.
Sheree wants to play against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the series, there was not much reason to start another one forcefully.
But always ready for the competition, Scherzerna is expected to take on the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but will still have the advantage of playing a chain match for the Rockies, who lead a game at the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies won the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night to clinch a wild-card spot, but they are still waiting to fight for their first division book.
"Even though we're not playing for anything, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver is going to be crowded, we're going to be able to come at least behind the rubber and play another team at a higher level than I've ever faced at any point this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but they may be reportedly inclined to let Scherzer in on such an occasion.
Scherzer, who will start his 34th season, had a bullpen session on Thursday and will be keeping an eye on his usual selections on Sunday.
This Washington Right-Hander is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA this season and 220 2/3 innings with 300 strikeouts.
Trump's visit to West Virginia
The President, while speaking about the importance of Republicans' presence in the midterm elections, referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, elected by the Supreme Court.
What you do in November will be different.
We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetime.
It’s one of the biggest, the biggest — I’m not fighting, but I’m really fighting, so I’m going everywhere for big candidates.
Trump said, "You see this terrible, terrible, extremist group of Democrats, you see it all happening right now.
And they have decided to regain power in any necessary way, you see, this selfishness, this callousness.
They don't care who we hurt, who we beat to gain power and control, that's why they want power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
He said the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and block."
And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "senseless and selfish and ruthless and liars."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee giving Democratic Senator Diane Finstein a rating, which was widely ridiculed by the audience.
Do you remember the answer?
Did you open the file.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, I wait one – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
There is no longer a large church.
They don't listen to what they say
It's no surprise that my colleagues in the Democratic Party voted for me to be impeached.
After all, I am the latest in a Labour MP’s queue to say no to you – just for speaking our minds.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, got the same treatment because she had taken a firm stand against hatred against the Jews.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn in the guilty verdict.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy on national security, Europe, these are unfortunately the same issues on which Jeremy had disagreements with previous leaders.
At a meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday, he said: "We want to be inclusive and productive in meetings."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, many meetings today do not have such an atmosphere and the promise of "more compassionate, civilised," politics has been forgotten only if, in fact, it began.
It is increasingly clear that opposing views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is being weighed on the basis of whether the party leadership would be acceptable.
It all started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, because I was surrounded by colleagues who had previously expressed similar political views and began to expect me to take a role that I would never have accepted otherwise – be it national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly and what I say is not really important I am told that I should not be in the Labour Party, that I should not be in the government.
And it's not just my experience.
Actually, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the reactions I get are political in nature.
I'm amazed at the professional and determined nature of friends who don't shy away from everyday sexual or racial abuse.
One of the biggest disappointments in this era of politics is the normalization of the level of abuse.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so liberal that with every "no-confidence" motion or change of rules of choice the party will shrink.
With a request to keep my head down and not speak more, I had received a lot of advice over the past two years as my "everything will be fine" after that.
But I didn't do that in politics.
Angered by the negligence of the Government of Thatcher, the entire class of my school virtually collapsed and since I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, as a local corporator or as a government minister, I have demanded better public service supplies for those who are in great need.
I have never shied away from politics in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be confused in any way about the state of my policies and the area of disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, all I can say is that I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader, the families, the businesses and your social services, the way the country is moving towards a Brexit.
But the fact is that I have a message not for the Nottingham movement, it is for the people of my constituency, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no degree of threat or political justification in office can stop me from my work, which I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is an MP from Nottingham East.
Iron 38 – 17 Melrose: Undefeated Iron reached the top
The delayed two trials may have had some adverse effect on the final result, but there is no doubt that Iyer deserved the day-night win in the amazing-entertaining Tenants Premiership.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end, his defense was as good as his excellent ability to take chances, which gave the local team and coach Peter Murchi the absolute right to be happy.
"We've been tested so much for our game and we're still unbeaten, so I'm happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "To the credit of this goes to Irene, they took advantage of opportunities in a better way than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute drive back by Frazier Clemo gave Ayre a lead, but a yellow card released by the Warriors for Scotland cap Rory Hughes earned Melrose points and Jason Baggett a misdemeanor draw.
Climo took the lead with a penalty before half-time, then returned the lead to Ireland 17-5 in a singles trial at the break.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's trial by Bagatt reduced the gap by five points.
The game was then halted for a long time due to a serious injury to Ruridh Knott, who was taken off the stretcher and from the restart went further by the reflection of Iyer Stafford McDowell's Trial Clemo.
The Iyer's interim captain, Blair McPherson, was then given a yellow card, and again, Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unchanged Bruce Colvin's try at the end of a very tense innings.
The local team then made a comeback, but, and while torturing Clemo without a ball from the penalty line-out, Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card, and McPherson beat the advancing Iyer to a touchdown.
After David Armstrong's box kick was caught by Kyle Rowe and sent away to flanker Gregor Henry for the local team's fifth try, Clemo converted it as he did during the restart.
Try your career in the steel game Star Hotel industry.
After learning that steel game star Ford Kirnon has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company, he stepped in to turn to the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old played Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he wrote and co-wrote with longtime comedian Greg Hemphile.
The pair have announced that the ninth series of the ongoing show will be the final one, and Kiernan is planning his life after work in Kreugling.
As per the official record listing, he is the Director of AdriftMorn Ltd.
A Scottish Sun source suggested that Kirron would join Glasgow's "explosive restaurant business," but the actor declined to comment.
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia’s hope of opening the way for the Court Pacific.
Sailors patrol the rigging-clad naval headquarters in Paz.
Flags of skyscrapers were hoisted on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the bottom of the ocean to the Amazon, the following motto appears: “We have a right to the sea.”
It's our job to get it."
The memories of the beach lost in the bloody conflict with Chile from the resources of the 19th century in the entire land-locked Bolivia are still alive as if there is still hope of sailing in the Pacific Ocean once again.
Those hopes are probably the highest in this decade, as Bolivia awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and courage, and of course is expecting a positive outcome from the outcome," said Bolivia's Ambassador Roberto Cazedila.
Many Bolivians will be watching the ICJ on the big screen across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will adjudicate Bolivia’s claim – after decades of ups and downs – that Chile has accepted responsibility for negotiating an autonomous route for the sea to Bolivia.
Bolivia’s charismatic local president Evo Morales — who faces a contentious battle for re-election next year — is also largely dependent on Monday’s election.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But according to some analysts, the chances of the court ruling in favor of Bolivia are very low – and even if it does, the situation will not change much.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no right to give Chile land, and they have contracted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The final dispute took place just six months after the ICJ was elected, suggesting that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And in moving forward for the cause of Bolivia, it may have pushed it back for the last four years.
"The issue of obtaining a sea route has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has ended Chile's reputation, he suggested.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will start talking, but it will be very difficult to negotiate after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Bolivia's representative in The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velez, has rejected the view that the court decision-making process is unusually dynamic.
"Monday will be a wonderful opportunity for Bolivia to begin a new era of relations with Chile," he said, adding that it will be an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits.
Morales is still Latin America's most popular leader, which Calhodilla denied and said he was using a maritime affair as a political gimmick.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to seek a path to the Pacific," he added.
"This judgment is an opportunity to see what the previous ought to have overcome."
North Korea says it will not denuclearize unless it trusts the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that if his country does not trust Washington, it will never disarm its nuclear weapons first.
He was speaking at a public meeting.
He urged them to abide by the commitments made by the United Nations during their meeting in Singapore during the course of the contest.
His opinion comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the verge of resuming his stalled nuclear policy after more than three months of meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "visionary delusion" that perpetuated sanctions and U.S. objections to such a declaration, which would end the Korean War and bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is aware of the acceptance of the Declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step towards significant disarmament.
Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump are expected to meet in the coming days.
But Pyongyang is very skeptical about being serious about leaving its scientific base, as the country considers this only as a guarantee for its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
At the Paris fashion show presented the latest range of giants to reach one of the main streets near you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or want full protection from the sun, don't look elsewhere.
Designers Valentino and Thom Brownie presented a range of large-scale unique hats for their SS19 collections, which made the Paris Fashion Week's Margin an eye-catching style
This summer, the most impractical hats made an appearance on Instagram and the designers sent their eye-catching creations to the catwalk.
A separate piece of Valentino was an over-the-top pinget-colored hat, decorated with a piece of pistachio-wide, beautifully decorated the heads of the models.
Other more-sized accessories included a collingad decorated with precious gems, a magic hat and a pineapple – but they weren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Thomas Browne also presented a range of extraordinary such masks - and that too in the time of Halloween.
Many of the masked lips were sewn, and they looked more like a Hannibal Lector than a superior fashion.
One design was like a scuba diving gear, which had huddles and goggles, while the other one looked like a dissolved ice cream cone.
And if you can use this great fashion statement - you'll be lucky.
Those who observed these styles were predicting that these hats could be found in huge quantities on the main road near you.
The ultra-large-sized hats were seen on La Lamba's heel, with two-feet-wide edge and straw hats, Rihanna to Emily Ratajowski.
The communal signage behind these highly impractical hats, which was named after social media, sent for yet another large design catwalk - a straw beach bag, like a swimsuit-wrapped young model might have picked up a little boy.
The black-orange Rafia bag with a white leather handle in the upper part, trimmed by Rafia Jhaler, was the best piece in the Jacques La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told Femme: “I was expecting big hats and beach bags to hit the main road next summer – the designer made such a huge impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for this oversized device.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to strive for academic excellence, and this has also been the case in 2018, with another set of unusual exam results added, attributed solely to individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
These schools, with more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which strives to deliver the best quality of service for their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen careers, and for their place as a global citizen.
As an education sector that can design and implement pre-school curriculum, we are looking at modern languages as a popular and desirable choice subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it will go straight to his head."
"If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it will go straight to his heart."
It is a very important thing to remember that we cannot rely solely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent exam, we can see that the language leagues with the highest passing rates among independent schools are topping the table.
68 per cent of students who had learnt a foreign language received a higher grade A.
Data collected from SCIS's 74 member schools showed that 72 per cent of students in Mandarin achieved higher grade A, while the number of German learners was 72 per cent, the number of French learners was 69 per cent, and the number of Spanish learners achieving A grade was 63 per cent.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills, which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a subject of choice is now being treated in independent school curricula and elsewhere like STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that a lack of language skills was responsible for 17 percent of the reasons given by employers to fill vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important for the youth to prepare for their future careers.
These skills have become essential in a globalized world, with more potential job opportunities requiring language.
Regardless of which career they chose, if they have learned another language, they can have a real advantage in the future because of the life skills they have in this way.
Due to the ability to interact directly with people from abroad, automatically the multilingual person will be placed at the forefront of this competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent were unable to speak a language fluently, and only 15 percent spoke French.
This is why it is so important for children to learn foreign languages.
Having multiple languages, especially those with a developing economy, will create better opportunities for children to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school teaches a different language.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what your child is interested in, there are plenty of languages to choose from in independent schools, and there are also teacher classes that specialize in teaching in related fields.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that will prepare students and equip them with the skills to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
This time in a global business environment, one cannot deny the fact that language is very important for the future of the country, so it is imperative to reflect this in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
Get rid of the bean.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait for LeBron James to play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers has come to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play against Denver Nugates in Sunday's pre-season opening game in San Diego.
It remains to be seen how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited-minute game.
James was asked earlier this week about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need a pre-season game to get ready," he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
US President Donald Trump kicks off his rally in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
It was the first of Trump's five scheduled rallies next week, with stops at locations that suit him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the Supreme Court holding back a vote of confirmation for his election to fill a vacancy, Trump is aiming to raise support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans fear losing control of Congress when the vote is due in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online through the live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, for this week's hearing, which has been marred by allegations of sexual misconduct, which has put the Senate's confirmation vote on hold for a week for an FBI investigation.
But the main goal of the rally is to help the Republicans gain some momentum in the run-up to the November election.
Thus, Trump's campaign said that the purpose of these next week's five rallies is to "encourage among volunteers and supporters, as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Congress control is so important to their agenda that as we move through this busy campaign season, the president will travel to as many states as possible," Trump's campaign spokesman told Reuters, without naming him.
Tonight's rally scheduled for Wesbonco Arena in Wheeling "can bring in a large number of supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage from the Pittsburgh media," West Virginia Metro News reported.
This will be the second visit to West Virginia in a month, from which it won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is seeking help from Republican Senator Patrick Morrissey, who is trailing in the West Virginia Senate.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come in to help him in these elections," said Simon Header, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States of America will fight to keep such a alive while going into Sunday singles.
After three consecutive sessions, on Saturday afternoon, the rider's cup was given a demonstration.
The oscillation of the impulse eating is a completely invented concept in sports, but it is one thing that the player is fully confident in, and never more so than such a competition.
So, where's the sense of urgency now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we're getting a little bit of momentum now," said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe is in a favorable position, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more left in the game.
Americans think so, says Spieth, that even though there is less wind in the way of their balls, and they have a lot to encourage, not just because of the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and scored three points out of four each.
Spieth has been aggressive from tee to green and his leadership is exemplary.
As soon as his round began, the shouts of celebration grew louder, when he and Thomas were two after two, taking an important putt and editing all four squares.
The screaming that was responsible for winning the match while at 15 was due to his putt, which would have made you realize that he believes the Americans are still standing in the competition.
"You've got to work hard and take care of yourself," he said.
Now it's up to each player to decide what's left.
There are 18 holes to make a mark.
The players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the controversial stories of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's mixed, but attractive pair got four out of four and there was nothing wrong with that.
"Mollywood" was the only pair who couldn't shoot a bogie on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and gave their support at nine o'clock on Friday morning.
That run, and the excitement that was pouring out from behind the crowd, seemed to indicate that the players were about to lose on Sunday, and as the sun began to set on Le Golf National, there would have been no other popular player there besides Fleetwood and Molinari to secure a possible European victory.
Both of them are at the same time better than the other.
However, the history of the European Union is short-lived.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson cut short the work of Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's foreballs, when he was paired with Alex Noreen.
A bogey on the front nine legs and two doubles earned the Spanish and Swedish never reached close to a hole.
On Sunday, though, there was no one in your room to help you.
Foreballs and Foursomes were very attractive to watch closely because of the harmony between the pair, the advice they gave and the advice they did not give, and the way a strategy could change in an instant.
As a team, Europe played well, so took a significant lead on the final day, but even in this Four Seasons session, Team USA showed a fighting attitude to it, especially the Stateside, where there was doubt.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a strong advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 lead over the United States after their exit from Saturday's Foreballs and Foursomes matches.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the match with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods and took their points tally to four points on the Le Golf National.
Two years ago, Thomas Journe's European team dominated the US team that played wrong in the morning foreballs in an attempt to maintain the trophy, winning the series 3-1.
In the Foursomes, Europe resisted more and won Dr. Matches, but they could not compensate for the loss.
Jim Farki's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European player to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were called "Mollywood," were the only pair to win all four points from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history after a thrilling weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reid in the Foreballs, they defeated the desperate Woods and the United States' Bryson Desbueier by 5 and 4 more in the swinger game.
Woods, who pulled himself out of two games on Saturday, would occasionally show a choice of excellence, but he was now defeated in 19 of his 29 matches in the Foreballs and Foursomes and seven in the row.
Justine Rose, who was rested in the morning for the Foreballs, returned to the Fours with partner Henrik Stansson and defeated world number three Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2 and 1.
There's nothing quite like a warm and sunny day in south-west Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They defeated Spain's John Rahm and Ian Polter in the Foreballs 2-1, and then returned to beat Polter and Rory McLorroy 4-3 after losing the opening two holes in the Foreballs.
Although former winner Furyk's team needs only one draw to keep the trophy, it has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team made a comeback from a four-point deficit when it went into singles.
After being second-best for two days, however, Sunday's counter-attack felt as if they were outside their doghouse.
North Korea has refused to allow a "unilateral arms race"
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions are fueling confidence in the United States and that it will not unilaterally give up nuclear weapons in such a situation.
At the annual general meeting of the Ri Yong Ho World Organization, North Korea said last year it had taken "remarkable willful measures" such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and pledging not to increase nuclear and nuclear technology.
"However, we did not find any relevant response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any trust in the U.S., we will not have confidence in our national security, and in such a situation, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first by any means."
While Renee reiterated North Korea's usual complaints about Washington's resistance to the "phases" of denuclearization, under which North Korea was to be rewarded for taking slow steps, his statement is notable, with Pyongyang refusing to stop unilateral denuclearization as it had done in the past.
In the first meeting held in Singapore on June 12, between the working U.S. president and North Korean leader, Rennie referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, in which Kim had promised to work towards "stopping the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump had promised North Korea's protection.
North Korea has been demanding a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must release its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed calls for the lifting of tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. is first pushing for "the cessation of denuclearization" and forcefully raising the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their objectives and also raising objections to a "declaration of an end to war," Ri said.
"It's a way of thinking about people who don't know us.
"The problem is that we are losing confidence."
Ri made no mention of plans for the second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leaders mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, saying: "If South Korea had been a party to the problem of denuclearization, and had the U.S. not, there would have been no such dilemma to end the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."
Still, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year, when he addressed the U.N. General Assembly that it was inevitable to target a major part of the U.S., including North Korea's rockets, when "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps for denuclearization, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and sanctions should continue until North Korea stops denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying “it didn’t matter if it took two years, three years, or five months.”
China and Russia argued in the UN on the issue. Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps taken by the Security Council.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and definitively until a complete, final and verifiable cessation of nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and explosive missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside and said at the U.N. General Assembly that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last visit was not good.
He left Pyongyang in July so that progress had been made, only for North Korea, within a few hours, to make the announcement that they were making "gun-like demands."
In a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea pledged that if the United States took relevant measures, it would destroy missile sites and, in addition, nuclear complexes.
He said Kim told him that the "relevant measures" he wanted would be the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course of adequate rest.
Harvard University is bringing a new curriculum to get more sleep for all its undergraduate students this year to cope with the increasingly masculine culture of ‘staying up all night’ with a caf<0xC3><0xA9>-service.
One educationist found that when it came to basic information about how to care for yourself at one of the worlds largest universities, they were often found to be unaware.
Charles Chizler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has designed a course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the US.
While giving lectures on the impact of sleep deprivation on education, he was inspired to start this course.
“At the end of it a girl came to me and said: ‘Why was I told this just now, when I am in my final year?’
She said she had not been told by anyone about the importance of sleep which surprised me.
The course, which was presented for the first time this year, explains how a good sleep habit is essential for students and athletes to perform and improve their general health.
Paul Berriera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, said the university has decided to start the course after finding students who have been severely deprived of sleep for weeks.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive goals.
One area is the image of a dorm room, in which students are drinking coffee, and there are curts, trainers, and books about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affected athletes' performance, and the importance of sleep timing regulation.
In the second part, participants were told how prolonged sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons then prompts participants to think about their routines.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just like you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking," said Professor Chizler.
A culture of pride still exists in waking up throughout the night, he said, adding that the emphasis on modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring good quality, adequate sleep should be a secret weapon to overcome the stress, fatigue and anxiety of the student, he said, adding - to avoid weight gain also, because if the brain is deprived of sleep, it keeps it hungry and constantly starves them.
Raymond Sone, a 19-year-old chemistry and physical biology student, helped Professor Chizler design the curriculum, which he took his classes during his first year at Harvard last year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote on-campus courses.
He hopes, in the next stage, all these postgraduate students will be told that they must complete a course like this before they are admitted to a competitive institution.
Professor Chizler recommended that students set alarms for when to go to sleep and when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which will disrupt the rhythm of your body clock, leading to sleep problems.
Livingstone 1 – 0 Rangers: Meng's goal showed the sky for Gerard's team
The Rangers suffered another setback when the Dolly Menga strike knocked out Steven Gerrard's dislocated team at Livingstone 1-0
The Ibrox team was looking for their first win on their way after a 4-1 win at St. Johnstone in February, but Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager was due to Gary Halt's team, which kept their team eight points away from Ladbrokes Premiership's leading Harts.
Menga struck seven minutes before half-time and never saw a team of under-motivated Rangers try to equalize.
With the Rangers now pushed to sixth place, Livingstone has moved to third place, behind only Hibernian at goal difference.
And there could be more problems for the Rangers as one item was thrown from the other end and Linsman had to be treated for a head injury to Callum Spence.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, surpassing Iyer's changes to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same Liv 11 guys, who had scored one point from the Hearts last week, and the way they cornered their rivals with their fine moves at every turn, he would have been very happy.
Although the Rangers had more control of the ball, Livingston made more use of the ball they had.
They could have scored in just two minutes when Meng's first-time take-off sent Scott Pitman into Ann McGregor's goal but the midfielder squandered his big opportunity.
Keegan Jacobs, who was on the deep, sent free-kick to captain Craig Holckett but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, got into the back post.
The Rangers regained control but showed a lack of confidence in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morales was adamant that he and Steven Lawless should have been awarded a penalty on the quarter-under-marque due to a collision, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers were able to hit only two first-half shots on target but it didn’t take much to stop former Ibrox goalkeeper, the head of Lasana Colbylie, and Avi Izaria’s lacklustre strike.
Lively's 34th-minute goal was against the flow of the game, but no one would argue that he earned it with hard work.
Rangers once again failed to counter Jacobs’ set-piece on the deep.
There was no response from Scott Arfield when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly picked up Meng for the easy completion.
Gerard showed efficiency by calling Colbylie in place of Ryan Kent in the break and that change was immediately noticeable. Morlos on the winger gave the pass but the forceful playmaker Kelly came from his line to block.
But, with Lithgow and Holckett hitting a long ball one after the other, Livingston continued to force the guests to play in their preferred manner.
In the final stages, Holt's team could have extended their lead, but McGregor stood firm to block Jacobs until Lithgow came from a distant corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton made a late second claim to Jacobs for a penalty, but Thomson never looked back.
Almanac: Explorer of the Geiger Counter
And now a page in our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: 136 years ago today, on September 30, 1882, and beyond... On this day in Germany, the future physicist Jonas William "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that further led to the discovery of the device, the Geiger counter.
Since then, in the mainstream of science, the geiger counter has also become a mainstream pop culture, as seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starring scientists like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans who appear to be cowboys:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: “This is the Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive alkalis like uranium.
When you put on this earphone, you can actually hear the sound of the effect of the molecules emitted by the radiation from the alkali."
Evans: "They might be popping up now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
His name, however, was immortalized.
The new cancer vaccine will teach the immune system to "see" the evil cells
The new cancer vaccine will teach the immune system to 'see' evil cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize evil cells as part of treatment
In this method, the immune cells of the patients are removed and replaced in the laboratory
They can then 'see' proteins that are common in many cancers and then re-integrate into the body.
This test shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman was diagnosed with ovarian cancer more than 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that taught her immune system to recognize evil cells.
In this method, the immune cells in the patients are removed and replaced in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein HER2, which is common in many cancers, and then re-integrated into the body.
J. Berzofsky, a professor at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of many types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
Similarly, the approach of "teaching" patients how to take out immune cells and attack cancer cells is useful in one form of blood cancer.
Kanye West wore a MAGA hat after his SNL appearance.
They didn't like it
After Kenny West's tumultuous performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and asked him to run for election in 2020, people blew his trumpet in the studio during Saturday Night Live.
At night, his ghost town, in which he wears the Make America Great cap, after singing the third song, he rose against the Democrats and once again expressed his support for Trump.
"How many times have I talked to a white man and he said: "How can you like Trump, they're racist?"
"If I had been born in the United States, I would have died a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a skit starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star spewed the tingle of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it hasn't been aired, West's buzzing footage was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It is not yet clear whether the West was trying to make fun of the Rocks after posting them.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had to suffer behind the platform due to a hat in his head.
"They put me in the back of the line.
He said, 'Don't put that hat on the stage.'
They've pissed me off!
And then he said I'm drowning," he told the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say: “Have you seen the sinking place?” So he said that he would “wear my Superman cap, because you can’t tell me what to do with it. Do you want the world to move on?
Try to love."
His comments were retweeted at least twice by viewers and appeared to be plagiarized by SNL cast members, many said, with one of them telling the publication: "There was a silence of death throughout the studio."
West was replaced by Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West presented the I Love It song in the costume of Perrier Bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group, TPUSA, Condense Turner, who tweeted: "For the most courageous person: Thank you for standing up for the crowd."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "just as it was and it's absolutely amazing."
"But I will not reward anyone who practices or spreads such ideology that is harmful to my community (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his "art").
Its free.
"We are free," he added.
Earlier on the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, which is now "formally known as Kenny West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, he followed Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy and P Daddy.
The fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was previously named Snoop Lion, and of course the former music emperor Prince, who changed his name to Prince, and he was previously known by the artist as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempt to murder after allegedly molesting a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has been infected with the virus
Kit Harington is best known for his role of John Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor criticised the portrayal of Mardaani Hero, saying such roles on screen often make young children feel that they should be a rakat to earn respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes in something is wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic vagrancy in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admits he has a "very strong" desire to solve the problem.
"I feel very strongly personally at the moment - what's wrong with our patriarchy?" he said.
‘What are we teaching them in terms of the problem we are seeing now as we grow up?’
Kit believes that due to the extremely masculine characters on television, they are partly responsible for the increase in toxic potency.
They say, "What is born and what is taught?"
Do you think that what is taught on TV and on the streets should have this particular aspect of being a man for young children?
I think that's one of the biggest questions of our time - how do we change that?
"There's something wrong with the kids."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones next summer after it ended, but that he was "tired of the battle and the horses."
From November onwards, Kit will be working on Sam Shepherd's revival of True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his stolen brother.
The actor recently revealed that the best outcome of Game of Thrones is the visit of his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on the show so in that sense she gave me my future family and life ahead," he said.
In the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Rose played the character of Kit's girlfriend, Jon Snow's girlfriend, Grit.
The couple got married in June 2018 at the family property grounds in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China's new cases increase by 14%
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials said more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were transmitted through intercourse, indicating changes in the past.
Traditionally, HIV was spreading rapidly in some parts of China with contaminated blood being given.
But Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province that the number of people infected with HIV had dropped to almost zero.
However, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 per year.
HIV infection through sexual intercourse is a major problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has increased everywhere.
Studies show that approximately 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women because of the country's conservative values.
Inadequate protection in such relationships leads to most of the diseases.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has been committed to the global availability of HIV drugs as part of its efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that the employee had breached the GOP senator's data and called it "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned the allegations that one of her employees posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislature's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat asserted that the claims were fueled by pundits and websites of the "jahal-right faction."
"Falseness, lies, and more hateful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published allegedly included residential addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
Isma, an unnamed person on Capitol Hill, appeared online on Thursday during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The three of them went to check on Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and Redstat reported that the IP address that identified the source of the post belonged to Waters' office and that an employee of Waters displayed the information, The Hill reported.
“These baseless allegations are completely false and baseless,” Waters said.
"A member of my staff - who was compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations of identity, personal information, and security - is not responsible for the breach of this information in any way.
These allegations are completely false and baseless.
Waters's statement was immediately criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Arie Fleischer.
“It’s sad,” Fletcher writes.
“This shows that her nature does not qualify her to be a Congress member.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they are not justified in getting angry.
They should not be disturbed.
They do not want to doubt the motives of the accused.
They need to be calm and happy."
The reaction of Flescher Waters was seen as comparing it to the criticism of Democrat Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being very angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who will contest against Waters in the midterm elections, also shared his views on Twitter.
"It's a really big thing," he said.
In his statement, Waters said his office had "informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent claims."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she added, "and they will be legally held accountable for all acts of violence that are destructive of them and dangerous to any or all members of my staff."
John English Strikes Again review - less effective Rowan Atkinson's intelligence irony
It has now become a tradition for British art to see the effects of Brexit in any new film, and this applies to the Johnny English action-comedy irony franchise - which began as Johnny English in 2003 and resurfaced as Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will we be happy self-admiration on the subject of how worthless we are as the country's new export opportunities?
In any case, the rubber faceless Johnny English has a second renewal of his cooking license - his name suggests that he has a huge comic creation design for those who watch movies in non-English areas.
He's definitely the dumbest secret agent who, despite being a ludicrous glamor's odd prodigy, looks a bit like Mr. Bean's Klauso (the stupid cop), and the man's goof contributes a note to the tune of the Chariots of Fire theme tune at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
The character Atkinson is based on a travelogue and mystery international man who once starred in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, adding to his confusion.
There are also a couple of good moments in this latest JE film.
I loved the fact that John dressed in a medieval English armor and went to the helicopter and hit his head with his wingspan.
The physical humor received from Atkins appears to be a gift, but the background to the fact that humor is far less effective and particularly "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now include humor as a component seems oddly unnecessary.
The humor seems to be designed not for adults but for children, and I don't think Johnny English's eccentric accident is as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent-film comedy in the form of Bean.
This is a common problem in Great Britain.
A cyber-hacker penetrates Britain's secretive super-secret web network and exposes the identities of agents on all of Britain's work, leaving the agent on the job puzzled - a very small role for Kevin Alden.
There is one last hope for the fiery and quarrelsome and one whose political popularity has already dwindled: Emma Thompson has cast a Terezha-May-like character, but there is not much room in the story for her to do more.
Her intelligence advisor informs her that she will have to bring in someone who has retired because of the disclosure of every active detective information.
And this means that the foolish Johnny English, who is now a school teacher in a luxurious colony, offers extra-curricular lessons on how to become an intelligence operative: there are some great jokes here because it makes the English school an academy of rock-type espionage.
English is called again for an emergency briefing at Whitehall in one stroke and again meets with his long-time colleague, Bo, who is portrayed by Bell Miller.
Bo is now married, married to a submarine commander, the Jolly-Hockey-Sticks role in which an artist like Vicky Pepperdine has wasted his potential.
Batman and Robin, who make terrible mistakes in the secret service of every magician, face off against the beautiful woman of Olga Kurilenko, Offelia Bulatova.
In the meantime, the charismatic tech billionaire who claims that the Prime Minister can solve Britain's computer problems is dangerously under the influence of: the terrible Jason Volta, perpetrated by Jake Lacy.
English and Bo embark on their ridiculous fun-filled journey: in the guise of a waiter they set fire to a flamboyant French restaurant; make a mess while smuggling themselves out of Volt's luxurious yacht; and English mocks the chaos by trying to wear a virtual reality headset to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volt's home.
All the events have been drawn up for the last occasion, but as fun and riotous as it is, it looks like a children's TV show.
Very little material.
And like so many other Johnny English films, this time I thought: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role to play in his talent?
The Labour Party rejected plans by the British to work four days a week and take a five-day salary
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a four-day work week and a five-day wage.
The party reportedly wants the company owners to transfer the money saved by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees by giving them one day extra leave.
This will give employees three days a week (weekend) but still there will be no reduction in salary.
According to the sources, the idea is a slur in the economic theatrics and policies of tilting the party's country towards the interests of the employees.
The trade union congress awarded workers a four-day week as a way to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "The policy change is expected to be announced later this year.
"This will not happen overnight but the four-day work week is an aspiration that matches the party's approach to revitalising the economy in the interest of the employees as well as the party's overall industrial policy."
The Labour Party is not the first party to endorse such an idea, with the Greens promising a four-day work week in their campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, this aspiration has not been fully rewarded by the Labour Party at present.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day work week is not the policy of the party and it has not been considered by the party.
Last week, Finance Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Conference to explain in more detail his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr MacDonald said he was determined to take power away from the "faceless directors" of service companies and "profits" in utility companies.
The Finance Minister's scheme also means that existing investors in water bodies cannot get back their entire share of investment as the labour government can make deductions on the basis of the misappropriation seen there.
They also reaffirmed plans to create a comprehensive ownership fund to fund up to 10 per cent of the shares of private sector entities for workers who are eligible to receive annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in the company's board of directors.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh has changed their minds
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and the Bureau's findings have raised questions about whether any Republican members could be swayed by his withdrawal of support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI had been able to find anything that could alter their views.
Kennedy spoke more freely than his colleagues in South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
“I have spoken to Justice Kavanaugh.
All of this happened, and then I called them up and asked, 'Why did you do that?'
He was unflinching, unassuming, and unassuming."
Graham's opinion, however, did not appear to be correct.
"I've made a decision about a strong voice and only a big accusation can change that," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has denied that charge with full force," Graham Kristin Blasey continued, referring to Ford.
And not every one of them knew her name.
It is 36 years old.
I don't think this will change anything."
Is there anything that can be done to reduce global poverty?
The annual music festival, the Global Citizen Festival, is being held in New York on Saturday, with huge stars taking part, and the goal of the event is equally as strong; eradicating global poverty.
In this seventh year of the Global Citizen Festival, thousands of people will gather at the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy the art of artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendis, but also to spread the true purpose of this social gathering. It aims to end the world’s poorest poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international campaign group that hopes to increase the number of people working to end poverty.
To get this easy-to-use free entry (if you don’t want to buy a VIP entry), the easy-to-view audience has to perform some tasks or a whole series of “acts” such as volunteering to promote their global eradication goal, emailing a world leader, making a telephone call, or following any other meaningful path.
But how successful is the Global Citizen after 12 years left to achieve its goals?
The idea of organizing free music gatherings for people is an honest way to persuade people to take action or just another form of so-called "cliquetivism"—which people think makes a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says they have recorded more than 19 million "acts" by their supporters for different purposes since 2011.
He says his actions have helped persuade world leaders to announce pledges and policies of $37 billion or more in funding, which is expected to impact more than 225 million people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group issued 390 pledges and declarations generated from its activities, of which at least USD 10 billion has already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that the funds made available have had a direct impact on the lives of around 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key pledges include Power of Nutrition. Power of Nutrition is the partnership of investors and organizers in the UK, which "helps young children progress to their full potential" and who, after receiving more than 4700 tweets from citizens around the world, have pledged to fund the country with $35 million to eradicate malnutrition in Rwanda.
With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make low-nutrition social injustice as insignificant as a footnote in history," Tracy Ulman, Goodwill Ambassador for Power of Nutrition, told an audience at a music social gathering in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to improve maternal and child nutrition in the UK, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 50 lakh women and children with nutrition assistance.
One of the most frequently asked questions on their website is, "How do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "This will be a big and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But we will succeed in the same way as the common rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, because our strength has grown by coming together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shaun Mendes, Cardi B and Janell Moone are some of the actors who will be performing at this year's SoHo in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Navy may use 'blockade' to block Russia's energy exports - U.S. Secretary of State
U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke has said Washington will use the Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from entering other markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke has alleged that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where Russia is acting at the invitation of its legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"They're in the Middle East because I think Eastern Europe, like the southern part of Europe, wants to broker energy," he said.
And according to officials, these are the ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the capability to block if necessary, while ensuring that sea lanes remain open to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinc Consumer Energy Alliance, a profit-making group that calls itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the U.S., was speaking to attendees at an event organised by the group.
He compared Washington's stances on Russia and Iran's transactions and noted that they were effectively similar.
"The most cost-effective option for Iran and Russia is to benefit from fuel and replace fuel," he said, calling Russia a "one-trick pony" and calling Russia's economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The remarks come as Trump's administration seeks to replace Russia with a cheaper alternative to European consumers by increasing its export of liquefied natural gas to Europe.
Accordingly, officials in Trump’s administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump has been “captured” by Moscow over Berlin because of that project.
Moscow has reiterated that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 11,000 cubic meters, is a fully affordable project.
The Kremlin argues that the opposition to the project from Washington is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we have a common view that energy cannot be a means of creating pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. has expressed strong support for the project, and Germany has expressed its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), a leading German industry body, has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"That's a big question for me when our energy supply is interfered with by a third country," said Dieter Kemp, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The Massachusetts House of Representatives said that Elizabeth Warren would "pay close attention" to the 2020 presidential election.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "pay close attention" to the upcoming presidential election after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed during a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, that she would consider contesting the election.
"Now it's time for women to go to Washington and rebuild their broken government, and that includes a woman sitting on top," she said.
"After November 6, I will carefully monitor the presidential election."
President Donald Trump "was leading this county in the wrong direction," Warren said, arguing with Trump during a town hall meeting.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been vocal in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We definitely need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday found that a majority of people in Warren's own constituency do not feel that they should contest the 2020 presidential election.
Eighty-eight percent of "potential" Massachusetts voters, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe Poll, said Warren should not contest the election.
Thirty-two percent of voters supported the measure.
The poll showed that former Governor Deval Patrick received 38 per cent support and 48 per cent opposition for a possible election.
Other key Democratic names in the debate with regard to the possible elections in 2020 included Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont MP Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin gave the example of Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally.
Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being listed in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"I can understand a little bit of the hurt of other families facing the map results of PTSD and the wounded soldiers who come back," he told an audience at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "an elephant locked in the closet" and said of her son and other warfighters, "When they come back, they're a little different, they get stiffer, they come back wondering if the respect that their soldiers and airmen and every member of the military have for the country is here."
Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett said Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and domestic violence with interfering with reports of domestic violence and possession of narcotics.
18 States, D.C. support the challenge to the New Asylum Policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have backed a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a friend-of-the-court brief in Washington on Friday to support a asylum-seeker who opposes the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace V. The details of the session suit which was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the consortium policy have not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and the children of his violent gang member" misbehaved with her but U.S. officials denied her request for a shelter facility on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers supporting Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as the countries facing the problem of gang and domestic violence, where the number of applicants for U.S. asylum is huge.
The U.S.’s new asylum policy reversed a decision taken by the Board of Immigration Appeals in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia's Attorney General Carl Resin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "has ignored state, federal, and international law for decades."
"All claims for asylum under federal law must be judged in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances of that claim, and such a ban violates that rule," the court brief said.
Lawyers in the brief further argued that migrants are more likely to become professionals and "provide essential workers," arguing that the denial of entry to migrants harms the U.S. economy.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June that victims of domestic violence and gang violence should no longer be allowed to enter shelters.
"As a member of a particular social group or political ideology or religion, there is a place for those who leave their country out of fear or persecution," Sessions said in a June 11 announcement.
Never expected to be able to find solutions to all the problems that people all over the world face every day, even the most serious ones.
Efforts are underway to rescue the victims as the death toll has doubled in search of survivors
The situation was much worse for the living.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said she felt "a lot of stress" when she saw her fever-stricken child in a detention centre in Palu, the consumed city.
"Every minute, an ambulance comes with a body.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen picking up their waterlogged belongings, trying to save anything they could find, returning to their destroyed homes.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were flooded.
Some of the injured, including the bi-harris of the back and shoulder, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where the patients were being treated outside due to persistent severe injuries.
His eyes were filled when he recalled that he had shaken the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was staying with his wife and daughter by a strong earthquake.
“I didn’t have time to defend myself.
I think I was buried under a pile of wall soil," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had moved to the city to get married.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she calmed down.
I don't know what happened to her and her family.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'spoiling' with 'vote-for-vote ads'
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. dailies detailing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused the U.S. press of using the U.S. to spread propaganda on Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump accused China of meddling in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections last Wednesday, which China rejected - citing the Chinese daily's paid supply in the Des Moines Register - the state's largest consumption newspaper.
Trump's accusation that China tried to interfere in the US elections is a new chapter in Washington's growing campaign to put pressure on China, as US officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to boost trade, Beijing and Washington appear to be waging a growing trade war, resulting in tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts say the retaliatory tariffs imposed by China at the start of the trade war were designed to affect exporters from states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, who has been a long-time governor of Iowa, which exports large amounts of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing caused damage to U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in Sunday's Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote, "China is now doubling down on its own free press propaganda propaganda and bigotry."
"In order to spread its own propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the tradition of free speech and free journalism in the United States by paying ads in Des Moines," Branstad writes.
"On the contrary, the anti-sorrow in newspapers placed for sale on the streets of Beijing appears to lack and does not reflect the true views of the Chinese people on China's problematic economic trajectory, as the media is under the strict control of the Communist Party of China," he writes.
He added that "a leading Chinese newspaper has turned down an offer to publish his article," but did not name the newspaper.
Analysts have warned that Republicans are polarising women voters by defeating the Cavanaughs before the midterms
Several top Republicans have stood by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defended him over allegations of sexual harassment, with analysts warning that they will be hit, especially by women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
This is a very serious issue, and the majority of Republicans are in favor of it.
Those things cannot be turned back," Grant Rieher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell College, said in an article published in The Hill on Saturday.
Rihar said there were doubts about whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)’s proposal for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, and they will not forget in November," said Carin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser as well as national spokesman for the progressive group Muvonne, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, after the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee supported Cavanaugh's nomination, protesters at the Senate Hallway chanted "November is coming!" Mick reported.
"Democrat's enthusiasm and motivation is overflowing," said the impartial political analyst, Stu Rodenberg, to the news site.
"People say it's already at the highest level; it's true.
But it can grow even more. Especially the volatile female voters in the suburbs, as well as the 18- to 29-year-old young voters, when the president doesn’t like it, they usually don’t vote.”
Even before public evidence by Ford detailing her sexual harassment allegations against a Supreme Court nominee, analysts had suggested she could be hit if Republicans agreed with it, with confirmation.
"It's a bit of a mess for the GOP now," former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee's opinion or the final vote or whether Cavanaugh will be elected, it's also about how Republicans handled the matter and how they treated her," Gay Cecil, director of the Privileges USA Group, who helped elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, in the background of the testimony of Ford and Cavanaugh, there appears to be a dilemma among Americans about who to trust, of which Cavanaugh's slightly more inclined to believe.
In a new poll conducted by Eug<0xC3><0xA8>ne, 41 per cent of respondents believed Ford's testimony definitively or potentially, while 35 per cent said they believed either definitively or prospectively in Cavanaugh.
Also, 38 percent of respondents said that if the Cavanaugh lied definitively or potentially during the testimony, only 30 percent said so in Ford's case.
The FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other accused, Deborah Ramirez, after Flake made the request, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified on oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that when he was 17 years old, Cavanaugh assaulted him in an inebriated state.
Ramirez alleged that a Supreme Court nominee at a party exposed his gender while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The fathers of the World Wide Web plan to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee is launching a startup that will compete with rivals like Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the well-known technology, 'Inrapt', is a company that is based on Berners-Lee's open source platform 'Solid'.
Solid allows users to choose where their data should be stored and what information to give people access to.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that Enrapt's previous goal was to "dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," he said.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can include contact lists, mailing lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
This means that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
The special thing about personal online data storage is that what kind of information is handled by someone will be completely in the hands of the user.
This is called "personal capacity through data."
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea is to bring resources, processes and the right skills to the company to make it available to everyone.
The company currently owns a security platform purchased from Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, which includes some of the developers' staff and volunteer coders' community contracted to work on the project.
From this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are "not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change that will cause all of their business models to collapse completely overnight."
"We're not asking for permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that Inerrupt’s “purpose is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help preserve the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has raised an effective voice in the Net Neutrality debate.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic for the next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vaughan: The First World War Celebrated by Victoria Cross Clark
100 years after its founding, the Church of England celebrated 100 years in honor of the only parish of the Church of England that won the Victoria Cross as a warrior in World War I.
Lt. Col. The Reverend Bernard Vaughan had won the prize in the attack on Belanglize and Lehcourt on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later, they were shot dead by a disguised soldier and never realized that they had received the highest honor of the British army.
At a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday, two of his grandsons unveiled a magnet built in his memory.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vaughan, said the unveiling of the javelin was "extremely symbolic" just 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Vaughan, under his leadership, led the battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through the heavy firing and machine gun fire from the very thick fog and from the battlefield."
They then proceeded to the firing line and single-handedly advanced the line "extremely bravely" before defeating the three Detachments, facing the artillery on the battlefield.
Lt. Col. Vaughan was killed by German snipers on October 4, 1918 - about a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vaughan, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I'll never be able to do but are humbling."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vaughan, also offered a bouquet of flowers after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said he was "very honoured to participate in the parade," adding that "the support offered by a whole host of people demonstrated the bravery of the genuine heroic man."
Fans of MMA woke up all night to see the Bellator 206, but instead they had to see the Peppa Pig
Imagine you've been up all night to watch a really full Bellator 206, but you've been refused the main show.
San Jose's Bill had 13 fights, including six on the main card and was to be shown live overnight on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m., while Gerard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face each other, he shocked viewers in the UK by broadcasting Peppa Pig instead of showing his coverage.
In particular, some people who had woken up early in the morning were disappointed.
One fan wrote on Twitter, "A kind of cruel joke on children's cartoons."
When asked about the broadcast, "as per government regulation, the content was not broadcastable at 6 a.m. so they had to have a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications at Billatar.
"Peppa the Pig," yes.
Scott Cocker, the chairman of the company, said he would reconsider his schedule to accommodate viewers in the UK in the future.
"I think when I thought about the replay, we thought we could do it," Cooker said.
"But it was six o'clock on Sunday morning and we couldn't do it until our Sunday, that is, their Monday.
But we are working on it.
Trust me, there were a lot of messages coming and going after that changed, and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
If it wasn't, it was a government job.
I can promise that this will not happen again.
"We're going to keep fighting five games instead of the six we've always kept - and we tried to give more to the fans, but we failed at that.
It was an unfortunate situation."
Dessert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'humiliated' from sex
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality - but that inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said, "I didn't realize that not everyone is like me until I went to secondary school."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about the rights of gay people to provide "hope" to others.
He also said that being a parent made him feel less appreciated for winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
Appearing as an outcast at Laverne's first event, the Daily said he felt "minority" when he was growing up, compared to everyone else, because "the likes of boys and girls were not accepted by society."
He said: "To date, feelings of inferiority and separation have been the key things that have given me the strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to show them that I was "someone," so that people wouldn't be disappointed when they actually find out about their sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist became a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more and more countries not to consider homosexuality a punishable crime.
He said it was because he considered himself lucky enough to live freely without fearing the adverse consequences of his actions and wanted to show "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said the man - who met in 2013, falling in love with U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black - "was amazing."
Daly married an Oscar winner 20 years older than him last year, but he said age difference was never a problem.
"When you've suffered so much at such a young age" - he competed in the Olympics for the first time when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find a person of this age who has seen such ups and downs.
The couple became parents to Robert Ray Black-Daly in June, and Daly said his "whole approach" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have said 'I want to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, the Olympics are more important than the gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medallist."
His son was named Robert after his father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daily said his father had not accepted that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether he had got tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I didn't have the courage to tell them, 'Dad, you can't sit in the first row,'" he said.
"When they took their last breath, I held their hands and didn't know for sure that they were invincible until their breathing really stopped and they died," he said.
The following year, Daly won a bronze medal by participating in the 2012 Olympics.
"I knew that there couldn't be a higher feeling than what I had dreamed of my whole life - diving into the Olympic Games in front of a home crowd," he said.
The inspiration for his first song was also the same - Proud by Heather Small - which blends with him in his preparation for the Olympics and still stands on his shoulders.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST on Sunday.
Michael Jackson, who was not in form, was picked as an extra player for the Ryder Cup
American Phil Michaelson will make a new record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to regain his form to avoid hurting this milestone.
Michaelson, who has played in this biennial event 12 times in a row, is being played by captain Jim Furyk as an additional player for Saturday's Foreballs and Foursomes.
Instead of participating in the actual game, as he has always done for the United States, this five-time major winner split the game into two with the hope of promoting his day and eliminating the factors that could have made his game worse.
Even without the most straightforward driver ever, the 48-year-old Michaelson is not ideal for a disciplined golf national course, where the long steeple never misses the wrong shot.
And if the course itself isn't as challenging, Michaelson will face the exact same British Open winner Francesco Molinari in Sunday's ninth match, who has teamed up with Rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans start 12 singles matches while trailing by four points, in the absence of a good start, Michaelson's match can be very important.
He had confidence in his players and couldn't say anything else.
"Today he fully understands his role, he put his hand on my back and put his hand around my neck and said he will be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He's the Hall of Fame and he's given a lot to these teams before and this week.
I had no idea he could play two games.
I was hoping for more, but I think that's the way to go.
He wants to be there for everyone."
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most appearances at the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may be the last match of his career that he will never be able to match the height of his personal records.
Michaelson won 18 matches, lost 20 and lost seven, Furyk said, adding that his presence gave the team an intangible value.
"He's funny, he's witty, he's witty, he likes to entertain people and he's a great person to be with the team," he explained.
"He's going to have a lot of fun with the young players, and that's what he's going to like to watch this week.
It's not just a game, it's more than that."
European captain Thomas Bourne believes that the big lead may disappear soon
The European captain, Thomas Bourne, knows from his experience that the adequate lead before the singles in the last-day Ryder Cup can easily be reversed in an uncomfortable ride.
Dane made his debut in a match at Valderrama in 1997, when a team led by Cev Ballesteror took a five-point lead over the Americans but when the matches ended, he was stifled and won by only the lowest margin of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and we won Valderrama, but only by a small margin," Bourne said while watching a class of 5-3 wins, both on Friday of 2018 and yesterday, which led to a 10-6 lead in the Lee Golf National.
History will show that this is not the end for me and everyone in the team.
You have to make a full recovery tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the things.
It doesn't end until you get to the top of the list.
Our goal is to win the trophy and that is what we will focus on.
I've said it all, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we know who is on our other side - the greatest players in the world."
Delighted with his players' performance on the difficult golf course, Bourne goes on to say: "I can never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow's challenge is different.
Tomorrow will be a different day and it will be different.
It’s always better to play with your partner when everything is going well, but when you go there alone, how does your ability as a golfer feel?
This is the message that you have to give to the players to give their best tomorrow.
Now, you want to leave your partner behind and he also wants to do his best."
Unlike Bourne, Furyk in the opposing group will focus on making his individual performances better than the ones performed by the pair, with the exception of Rodden Spieth and Justin Thomas who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself was a part of the victorious team on both sides of the big last-day turnovers, before that defeat, as Europe faced off with a "miracle of the day."
In 1999, when captain Crenshaw asked his players about how they went forward on the last day, Uttaradakhal said, "I remember every word of it."
"Tomorrow is our 12 important matches, but you have to start fast, as you've seen in Brooklyn, as you've seen in Medina.
When it moves in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle.
We'll set our line-up accordingly and put our players in that spot as if we were going to do some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was sent forward on a performance to try a fightback and was to face Rory McLaroy in the top match, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood at the top half of the other Europeans order.
"I put these players in this order because I thought they would cover all sides," Bourne said while talking about his single selections.
Germany's new warship has been postponed again
Germany's navy's latest warship was supposed to be operational in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships, but due to poor systems and high prices, it will not be operational until at least next year, local media reported.
According to a military spokesman, the implementation of the "Rhyland-Faiz," the main battleship of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>ttemberg-class warship, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was scheduled to be commissioned into the Navy in 2014, but the fate of the ambitious project was left behind due to concerns over post-distribution issues.
Four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships, which were sought by the Navy in 2007, will come to replace the Bremen-class combat frigate.
It is believed to have a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft squadron and anti-ship missile, as well as some hidden technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include a long maintenance period - the latest combat misadventures should make it possible to deploy away from home ports for up to two years.
However, the continued delay means the modern warship - allowing Germany to demonstrate power at sea - may have already expired when it enters service, Die Zeit noted.
The ill-fated F125 battle went viral last year, when German naval officers refused to operationalize the ship and returned it to the Loom and Foss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy had returned the ship to the shipbuilding company after delivery.
Not much is known about the reasons for the return, but German media said there were several important "software and hardware defects" and that it was not suitable for deploying warships on combat missions.
The software shortages were particularly significant, as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>ttemberg-class ship would be operated by 120 sailors - half of the manpower on the old Bremen-class combat ships.
Also, it was found that the vessel is very heavy which will reduce its performance and the Navy will not be able to upgrade it in the future.
The 7,000-tonne "Rhyland-Faiz" is believed to weigh twice as much as the same-class boats Germany used in World War II.
Along with faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - has also become a problem.
It has risen from an initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion - to an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The latest confrontations are of particular importance in the wake of warnings that Germany's naval power is dwindling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy had "really been running out of fast-developing boats."
The official said the problem is growing rapidly as time goes by as old boats are decommissioned, but new ships have not come in their place.
He regretted that any combat misadventures in the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class did not have the capability to enter the Navy.
National trusts hear thefts about the secret life of bats
New research was carried out in the Scottish mountainous region to reveal how bats use the terrain to search for food.
It is hoped that the invention will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation work.
A study by researchers from the National Trust of Scotland will trace the common and soprano pipestrels, as well as brown long-eared and douben bats, to the Inverive Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special acousticals will be placed at strategic locations on the property to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all soundprints will determine the frequency of bat calls and determine which species are doing what.
A map and report of the natural habitat will then be prepared to give a detailed picture of their behaviour on the land-scale.
Rob Daver, NTS's nature conservation consultant, hopes that the results will reveal which area of natural habitat is important for bats and how each species uses it.
This information will help in determining the benefits of management of natural habitats such as the creation of pastures and how best to maintain forest land for bats and other related species.
In the last century, the number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly.
They are at risk due to loss of habitat and natural habitat affected by construction and development works.
Air turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as well as some chemical processes of flypapers and construction materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their habit of hunting at night makes their ears more useful than their eyes to catch prey.
They use state-of-the-art eco-location techniques to detect pests and obstacles in their path.
The bats have been taken very seriously by the NTS, which is responsible for the care of 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspect habitats and sometimes even carry out rescue operations.
The Institute raised Scotland's first and only vassal reserve at Three Estates in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten species of Scotland.
The property's manager, David Thompson, said the estate is an ideal location for them.
"It's a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good natural habitat.
But, there are many things about bats that are not yet known, so the work we are doing here and on other assets will help us understand more and more about what is needed for them to thrive."
They emphasize the need to investigate bats before maintaining the property because it can lead to the inadvertence of a single maternal habitat, which can lead to the death of 400 females and babies, and the risk of the destruction of the local population as a whole.
The bats are protected and it is an offence under the law to kill, torture or harass them or destroy their habitat.
The Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, Elizabeth Ferrelly, encouraged people to help.
She said: "We have a lot to learn about our bats because we don't know what the population status of many of our species is."
Ronaldo has denied the rape allegations and the lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo dismissed the rape allegations against him as "false news" and said people wanted to "promote them" by using his name.
His lawyers were preparing to file a lawsuit against the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
An American woman named Catherine Myraga has been accused by Portugal and Juventus of raping her in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he was accused of giving her $375,000 to keep her mouth shut about the incident.
Speaking to his 142 million followers from Instagram live video hours after the news of the claim, the 33-year-old made the possibility of the news "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
"What he said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to use my name.
Its normal.
They're trying to get fame with my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm happy and everything is fine," he said, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the charges, which they say is an "unacceptable reporting of private sector suspicion."
Lawyer Christine Schertz said that the player "could seek compensation equivalent to the scope of the breach, which is potentially one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times, for moral damages."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting in the nightclub, Ronaldo and Myraga allegedly went back to the player's room, where he raped her anal.
Mayorga claimed that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo took to his knees and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and "by a percentage" disappointed her.
The documents claimed that Ronaldo accepted the sexual relationship, but said it was consensual.
Myraga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had photos of her wounds drawn in the hospital, but she then agreed to settle out of court because she felt "fear of needles" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now pushing the compromise because she would still be intimidated by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was preparing to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and this summer went to the Italian giant Juve for a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: The UK will have to 'permanently repent' of its carmakers
Greg Clark, the UK's business secretary, said he "will regret it forever" if the UK loses the status of a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He added that "a matter of concern" is that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, they will temporarily stop production at the factory in Bernstein, near their derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses due to border delays.
The Bernstein plant - where Toyota's Auris and Avensis were produced - produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the EU.
"I think we'll see our factory stop production if the UK leaves the EU by the end of March," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's Bernstein-based managing director.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed concerns about how cross-border trade would operate if they left the EU without a deal.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of manufacturers is that the supply chain will be at risk in case of no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "very timely" principle, where spare parts are delivered from suppliers in the UK and EU every 37 minutes for cars that are manufactured on demand.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal before March 29, there could be a reversal at the border, and there could be a delay for spare parts, according to the industry, and they could fall short.
It will be impossible for Toyota to withhold more than one day's worth of cargo at its Derbyshire plant, and the company says it will stop production.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's checkers plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
“We need to get a deal done for us. We want a best deal, as I said, for the time being, we don’t just want to be happy by making it a success, but we should take advantage of this opportunity,” he said on BBC 4’s Today programme.
"This evidence is not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, for whom you need to maintain this thing, by which the supply chain will be extremely successful."
Toyota did not say how long production would last, but warned in the long run that increased costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and, of course, affect jobs.
Peter Suvallarius, who worked at Burnstone for 24 years and is a Unite Union Convener at the plant, said that his members were extremely concerned: "In my experience, once their jobs are gone, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The White House said Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again.
The White House on Sunday said Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed "for another week" as a dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, which includes investigations into Russian election interference, links between Trump's allies and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumours have been circulating in Washington for months that Trump will not show the deputy attorney general the way out, and that Mueller's freedom could be in jeopardy.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had put up a wire to record talks with Trump, through which the 25th Amendment was likely to remove the president.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House to discuss his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would not "like" Rosenstein's ouster, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that would witness both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh, further delaying the entire Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "There's no date set for that, it could be this week, I think it could be pushed back another week, looking at other things going on with the Supreme Court."
"But we will see, and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists argued that this was certain: Sanders has not given details to the White House press since September 10.
Chrissy Teigen asked the reason.
Sanders said she was not hostile to the "performance" of TV journalists for the lack of reporting, adding: "I don't deny this reality is showing up."
He suggested later that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase."
"This president holds more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him," she said, and then said without giving evidence: "We've seen those numbers."
Sanders said the statement would continue, but “if journalists had the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it would be far better than talking to me.”
"We try to do that a lot, and over the past few weeks you've been doing that, and when you can talk to the president of the United States, it will take the place of giving statements to the press."
Trump regularly listens to questions while leaving the White House or attending a press conference with high-ranking officials in the open session or visiting the White House.
There are hardly any press conferences.
This week in New York, the president probably showed cause for carelessness and bizarre presentations to assembled journalists.
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff in NHS Scotland about the concerns of Brexit.
The Health Secretary wrote to EU employees working in the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and wish to remain post-Brexit.
Jean Freeman sent a letter to MSP less than six months after he was forced out of the UK EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to meeting the cost of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in public services with a responsibility on their shoulders.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: "Throughout the summer, negotiations continued on the exit between the UK and the EU, which are expected to be decided in the coming autumn.
However, the UK government is also preparing for a possible deal-less situation.
I know this is going to be a difficult time for all of you.
That is why I want to reiterate that irrespective of their nationality, I value the contribution of every member of the staff.
Co-workers in the EU and beyond bring invaluable skills and experience, which strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Kristen Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday’s 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reedy told reporters he was injured just before half-time.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed there," Reid said.
The coach and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before being put on the stretcher and taken for further diagnosis.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had exited after surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type or extent of the injury" and is trying to find out when the Tennessee State injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year redshirt student, was playing his first season for Tennessee State after migrating from Illinois.
Earlier on Saturday, he had earned a total of five tackles, taking his total to 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp duty to purchase property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp duty to purchase property in the UK and the additional money received will be used for the homeless under the New Tory scheme.
This step will go a long way in the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters.
This stamp duty will be levied for those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The fund is expected to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>12 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers are willing to pay more stamp duty to buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be considered as an attempt to overcome the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with a commitment to provide more affordable housing and target higher-income people.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and companies not paying taxes in the UK, and the extra money will boost the government's campaign to help people who sleep on the streets.
Surcharge – This will be in addition to the present stamp duty levied on other houses at higher rates than two years ago and can be expensive by up to three per cent for hire purchase.
The move is expected to cost the Treasury up to <0xC2><0xA3>12 million a year.
According to one estimate, 13 percent of newly built London property purchases are made by non-UK citizens, which increases their prices and makes it more difficult for first-time homebuyers to take steps to buy a home.
Many affluent areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost villages” due to foreign buyers, as they spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was announced just weeks after the stamp duty cut to help Boris Johnson's more young people buy their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of buying and keeping land but not using it, thus increasing property prices, and he urged Mrs May to remove reservations on affordable homes, so as to overcome the "housewreck" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced an ambitious series of proposed housing reforms, including controlling rent and ending evictions "without fault."
They also want to give more power to the councils to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my Prime Minister's post to restoring the dreams of a better life for the British people - for every new generation.
This means that there is a market for fixed-income housing.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a life here.
However, it will not be as easy for people who do not live in the UK and as well as British residents who work hard for companies abroad to buy houses.
For many people, the dream of owning a dream house has become a distant reality, and the disillusionment of those who sleep on the street has become a reality.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become the manager of Scotland"
Sunderland owner Jack Ross said his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager one day.
Scott, 42, is enjoying the challenges while reviving the North-East club, and is three points short of the top spot, finishing third in League One.
He's headed to the Stadium of Light this summer, guiding St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I got the B cap and that's all I got," Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsAudio.
"But when I was a kid, I grew up watching my father play for Scotland at Hampden, and that has always pulled me in.
It will only happen if I succeed in managing the club."
Ross was previously the manager of Sunderland, with Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo de Canio.
The owner of the former Alloa Athletic said he had no fear of being tracked by such well-established names at such a large club when his proposals were rejected by Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The measure of success for me at the moment is whether I will take this club to the Premier League or not.
With the structure and facilities in this club, this club is undoubtedly eligible to go to the Premier League," he added.
"It's not easy to take him there, but if I can take him back to the club, maybe I'll find myself successful."
After a 15-month period of assistant owners and training staff at Hearts in Dumbarton, Ross's management career has only lasted three years.
They later helped Aloya improve to the third tier from being knocked out and lead St. Mirren to the title of the winner from the possibility of being knocked out in the later season.
And Ross says he feels more than ever satisfied with his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Avoiding the burden of aloe means that he might have been really cross-eyed," he recalls.
"I really think the management was more suited to me, even more than the game itself."
It seems odd because I played well, made a decent living, and enjoyed some of the right top spots.
But it can be difficult to play.
You have to do a lot of things every week.
Even today, I go through the stress and pressure of work, but still the management seems to be right for me.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I'm most satisfied because I'm working to my own liking throughout my adult life."

According to the survey, the exact time of drinking alcohol is 5.30 pm on Saturday.
The summer heat has given a boost to Britain's struggling pubs, but there has been more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups posted a 2.7 per cent growth in July – but restaurant business declined 4.8 per cent, data showed.
Peter Martin of the CGA, who has compiled the data, said: "Continuous sunlight and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup, this also meant a repeat of the previous June format in July, with pubs trading up 2.8 percent, except for a further setback to restaurants.
The company's retail sales fell 1.8 percent in June.
Pubs and bars, which provided more drinks than the restaurant business, performed very strong.
Even the pubs that provided the food were not as dramatic as those that run the restaurant, but they were also weak in the heat.
It's like people just want to drink.
Sales of beverages in well-managed pubs and bars rose 6.6 per cent in the same month, while consumption of beverages declined by three per cent.
Paul Newman, of Comfort and Hospitality Analyst RSM, said: "We see these results as a trend that has been going on since late April.
When it comes to outdoor market sales, weather and important social or sporting events are the most effective factors.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are struggling, although a decline of 4.8 per cent over the previous year will be especially painful under the current spending pressure.
"The long hot summer should not have come at a time when it was a difficult time for the drivers selling the product, and only time can tell if the moderate temperatures we experienced in August can provide the much-needed relief," he said.
With the newly opened, the overall sales growth in July in pubs and restaurants was 2.7 percent, indicating a slowdown in brand roll-out.
The Coffer Pitch Tracker industry for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, with a combined turnover of more than 9 cents and established industry parameters, oversees the sales of 47 driving groups and collects and analyzes data on their performance.
One in five children has a secret social media account, which he hides from his parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – has a secret social media account, which he hides from his parents and teachers, the survey revealed.
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase of "fake Insta" pages.
The news has caused a lot of panic that sexual content is being posted in it.
Twenty percent of students say their “main” account is for parents to show up.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – is creating social media accounts, which are kept secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed that “fake Insta” accounts are growing exponentially – a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has caused a lot of panic that sexual content is being posted in it.
Twenty percent of students say that their cleaned “main” account is meant to show parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother fell in love with her 13-year-old daughter on a secret site when she was the first to request others to "rape me."
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Council of Heads and Heads of Independent Schools (HMC), found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two identities, and half of them admitted to maintaining a private account.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's so sad to see so many teenagers so eager to create online spaces that their parents and teachers won't be able to find."
Ilyich Doyle will be the "voice of the players" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Ilyich Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is one of Scotland's most famous track and field players and President Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those conducting the sport to benefit from his extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
Ailey has tremendous respect for the Scottish, UK and global players community and we are sure that bringing them on board will greatly benefit the players in Scotland," BT said.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to be a voice for the players and I hope I can contribute and guide the game in Scotland."
At the 1996 Games in Atlanta, which won two of its four Olympic gold medals in the 200 and 400 metres, the American has now become a regular BBC pundit, unable to walk after suffering a transit ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Only time will tell if I'm okay or not.
It was exhausting work, but I was completely healed, I learned how to walk again and today I do the agility exercises!
Thanks for the messages of encouragement!"
Online votes were divided on the advertisement of breast pumps comparing mothers with cows.
An online poll showed an advertisement comparing breast-feeding women to cows displayed by a breast pump company.
Launching the pump, considered the "world's first quiet usable breast pump," the consumer tech company Elvini displayed an anti-music video ad that showed the independence of the new pump for breastfeeding mothers.
The four real mothers dance to the rhythm of the song in a store full of cow dung: "Yes, I give milk, but you can't see my tail" and "If you don't notice, they're not clumsy, but my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pump it, pump it, I'm stuffing babies, pump it, pump it, I'm pouring out my women's milk."
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has sparked an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of enemies, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many suggesting that the dairy industry's "tragedy" had been taken too lightly.
"It's a very good idea to use this product."
With the exception of the fact that within a few days of giving birth, their baby is taken away from them, they, like us, become pregnant and give birth to a baby to give milk."

Another commented: "Naturally, it is distressing for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't they use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who keep their babies?"
Another wrote: "This is an unsubstantiated ad."
While others supported the ad, one woman accepted the song as "fun."
"I think that's a great idea.
If I'd had more milk, I'd have had one.
It made me feel like a pump.
This ad is a bit crazy but I think it's the right thing to do
It's an unusual product," one wrote.
Another commented: "This funny ad is for mothers who pump (usually in their workplaces or bathrooms) and make them feel like cows."
This advertisement is not an ad that praises or predicts the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women are seen dancing in their bras.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the vision of many women who feel like cows to women who use breast-pumps.
However, the Elvi pump is completely silent, does not have wires or nozzles and sits accurately in the nursing bra, which allows women freedom of movement, can hold children, and can even go out during pumping.
Anna Ballarin, Partner and ECD at Mother, expressed the view: Elvi Pump is a revolutionary product, which needs to be launched in an open and provocative manner.
We wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges by showing the similarities between lactating women and dairy cows, the amazing sense of freedom that new pumps offer us, in an interesting and relevant way.
This isn't the first time that Alvi has made headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two was seen using this product for designer Marta Jakobowski while catwalking.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved into a tent camp on the Texas border.
Although the monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, the number of detained migrant children increased in part, as the harsh language and policies presented by the Trump administration have made it difficult to keep children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants, and when coming forward to adopt a child, they are afraid to risk their own ability to sustain themselves in that country.
The risk increased in June when the federal authority announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household would have to give their fingerprints, and that data would be handed over to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested some people who had applied to sponsor minors who were not accompanying anyone.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
"About 80 percent of people who are sponsors or have domestic members of sponsors remain illegal, and a large part of them are involved in criminal acts.
"We're going to continue to support these people," said Albion.
In order to speed up the process of children, the authorities introduced new rules, according to the shelter workers, some of them will have to appear in court within a month, instead of the previous 60-day standard, since their detention.
Many will appear through video conferencing instead of appearing in person to present their pleas for legal status before the migration judge.
Those who refuse to help will be thrown out of the country.
According to income reports from shelter workers and the system in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more anxious or desperate they may become, leading to violent tendencies or attempts to flee.
Lawyers say that those problems are rampant in larger facilities like Torniello, where, due to the large number of children there, children who are being ignored are found to be struggling too much.
He added that the children being taken to Tent City are being given extra trauma by not giving them time to be emotionally ready or to say goodbye to their friends.
Syria called on the US, French and Turkish forces to leave immediately.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem said Syrian refugees should return home, even though the country's war has reached its eighth year.
Moulaym, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces on Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism were illegal, and "will be treated fairly."
"They should leave the country immediately and there should be no conditions for it," he said at the meeting.
Moulaym stressed that the "war on terror in Syria is now almost over", in which 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been rendered homeless.
He said that "all Syrian terrorists of the terrorist group" and "any foreign existence is not cleared up, Damascus will continue to fight this holy war".
The United States has more than 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Syrian Arabs who oppose the Kurdish army and President Bashar al-Assad.
There are more than 1,000 French troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the question of surrenders, Moulaym said that the situation was conducive for them to return, but he blamed "some foreign countries" for spreading "irrational fear", which led to the surrender being abandoned.
"We have requested the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"What should have been purely humanitarian is people doing politics."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive any reconstruction aid until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has given journalists an opportunity ahead of the political storm.
The Russian-Turkish deal has avoided a large-scale attack on the province by Syrian forces backed by Russia, where three million people live.
However, Moulaym stressed that there was a "clearly set deadline" for the deal and hoped that the army's action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to al-Qaeda, and root them out.
UN Ambassador Stephane de Mistura is hoping that the first meeting of a new committee, composed of government and opposition members, will be held soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moulaymani put forward conditions for the Syrian government's inclusion in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to a review of the current constitution's regulations and warned against any interference.
Trump will win a second term.
According to that logic, as many liberals would probably be hoping that impeachment and an unpleasant event would lead to his premature termination as president, but if not, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020.
There is no doubt that "it will be the most dramatic presidential final fight ever!"

I, for one, will never see Super Mario again as I did the first time.

When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss' home this week, there was a nice sun and 80 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he had recorded the CNN and had immersed himself in watching MSNBC.

In the mid-term elections, there is a lot of money in the house.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is seeing a flood of money, which is attributed to the redistricting of congressional districts that saw two candidates stand in the race for the same seat.
It recently re-raised Democratic Republican Connor Lamb in the suburban Pittsburgh district – who won his seat from another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb stood in front of the second candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which was heavily covered with the new 17-bedroom facility.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally created in favor of Republicans, the maps were redrawn.
The race for the new 17th marks the beginning of an economic struggle between the main party's economic side, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election in March, widely seen for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat was held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won that district by 20 points.
Yesterday, the Democrats took control of the Senate.
US decided to punish El Salvador over support for China, then changed the decision
Diplomats noted that after a slight withdrawal from Washington, the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing.
Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization management team's partner was evicted.
State Department officials recalled the U.S. Chief of Diplomatic Missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "from their recent decision not to recognize Taiwan," Department spokesman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
But the only consideration was to impose penalties on El Salvador, which received an estimated USD 140 million in US aid in 2017, including enforcement controls, developmental and financial assistance.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the country in Central America because of the high number of unemployment and killings in the country.
As the internal meeting progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to pursue a similar summit last year, which was seen as a step in the effort to stop migrants heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, the top administration made it clear that it wanted the council to move forward and effectively end the consideration of any penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now address the conference, which is now set to be held in the middle of October and in the middle of that conference, the diplomats said.
And without any new harsh message or punishment from Washington, all three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to one Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to give details of the discussions, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who had agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the terms of anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an external analyst, who was close to the administration and, likewise, spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next inevitable event could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report of Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which is now very much evidence in public records.
According to reports, Mr Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether there is a conspiracy of Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack on his election.
If Congress changes sides, Mr. Trump will see himself face to face with accountability at that institution, when he is ready to go before the voters once again, and perhaps eventually go before a jury of his peers.
There are a lot of them, and I don’t mean to say that Mr. Trump’s defeat is inevitable — or that his counterpart’s defeat in Europe is inevitable.

The study of history focused on the occurrence of such points of disagreement and accelerated or delayed the continuing march of democracy.
The U.S. is now dealing with a number of these issues.
What would you do if Mr. Trump fired Vice President General Rod Rosenstein, who is handling Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
He has been in trouble ever since the newspaper reported that Rosenstein had given the idea last year to secretly record the president and that he was not fit for office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, The Times account is incorrect.
How would we respond if the FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's new role is not complete or fair - or if it is decided to send him to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual misconduct and dishonesty?
Moreover, will we take the midterm election for Congress and hold Mr. Trump accountable for it?
If we fail to do so, democracy will suffer for a long time.

With a thrilling draw with Villarreal in Spain this month, he feels his chances of qualifying for Group G in the Europa League are too high.
Graham Dorans did not get off to a good start this season due to a knee injury, but he feels the Rangers should look at this match as the start of another brilliant performance with a 2-2 draw against Villarreal.
The 31-year-old said, "It was a good game for us because Villarreal is a strong team."
"We started the game thinking we'd do something good and get points.
"We could have done that in the end, but in the end, it was a fair decision.
It could have been better in the first half and we were in the latter half and we were on top.
It's another great day in Europe.
"Hopefully we get three points but it will be difficult to play because even though they are good in the last game, I am sure with the support of the people who we have, we will definitely get a positive result.
"The last year has been really tough, all the injuries and changes in the club, but it's still a good place to be.
The team is good and the kids are really enjoying it; the training is good.
Fortunately, we can try it now, put the past behind us and be successful.”
The fear of this retirement savings has woken up the women of the class
Despite having a clear idea of how to care for the participants in the survey, some people were talking to their family members.
In a nationwide study, nearly half of the respondents said they were talking about the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent of the people who spoke to the children said this.
“People want their family members to take care of them, but they’re not taking any steps to communicate,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance business nationwide.
Start from here.
Talk to your spouse and children about this: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you haven’t told them your wishes ahead of time.
Consult with your advisor about where and how to take care of it, and discuss with your family, so that choosing these things can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Talk to your financial advisor to find out how you can pay for these services.
Your fund choices for long-term supervision may include a traditional long-term maintenance insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or a self-insurance with your own assets.
Take away your legal documents: Complete legal matters ahead of time.
Get a health-care proxy so you can hire a trusted person to look after your medical care and make sure that the professionals have complied with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Think about the power of money for your business.
You have to choose a reliable person for you and make sure that your bills are paid when you are disabled.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parents are in a medical emergency and want to be taken to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and alcohol?
Keep all the details in writing so that you are prepared.

Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
A strong earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday killed at least 384 people, officials said, adding that the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the shock of the contact, relief officials could not get any information from the Dongla Regency, which falls in the northern part of Palu, which is the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
The important facts at Palu and Dongla on Sulawesi Island are as follows:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongla is a regency located 300 km (180 miles) from the northwestern coast of Sulawesi Island.
The province is an administrative region with a population of approximately 299,200 as of 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Dongla.
Nickel mining is also important in this region, but it is more and more concentrated in Morovali, which is on the opposite side of the Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's disaster management agency, there have been several tsunamis in Palu and Dongla in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami struck West Dongla, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is prone to earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake struck the western coast of the Aceh Prefecture in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, causing tsunamis in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a powerful earthquake struck the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude tsunami struck the south of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake strikes Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake strikes the Sumatra-based Mentawaibet, creating a 10-metre-high tsunami that devastated dozens of villages and killed nearly 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the PD Jaya Regency in Aachen, destroying much of it and creating an atmosphere of fear, which reminded people of the terrible 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunamis were reported, but more than 100 people were killed.
2018 - Indonesia's tourism island of Lombok is hit by a major earthquake, killing more than 500 people, mainly north of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed and thousands of tourists were stranded for hours.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old from Wasla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and for interfering with reports of domestic violence and opposing arrests, according to a report released by Alaska state officials.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the crime, he took the phone away from her.
Palin is being remanded to the Mart-Su pretrial facility and placed on a bail bond of $500, KTUU said in a report.
In a media report, he was produced in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty" when questioned.
Palin faces a third-degree felony, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was previously charged with second-degree murder and was sentenced to one day in prison and fined $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, had called the police to file a complaint about the attack.
The case is currently pending in a court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in a domestic violence crime report, and possession of narcotics in connection with the incident.
A friend of mine was accused of stabbing her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans after she was linked to a violent transaction with her son's PTSD that originated from service in Iraq in 2016.
Earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of thousands of people

New York terror attack suspect pleads for death penalty
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov. Suspected accused in the New York terror attack that killed eight people—the state has not issued such a strict sentence for federal crimes since 1953.
The 30-year-old had used a rented home depot truck to attack a two-wheeler on a road near the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October.
In order to be eligible for the death penalty for purposes of capital punishment filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight of those people and caused "intentional" serious bodily injury.
According to court documents, the death penalty is admissible in both cases.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts of murder, including eight counts of murder with the aid of racketeering. In a case of organized crime, federal prosecutors and motor vehicles were charged with destruction.
Describing what Saipov said was "heinous, cruel and outrageous", the lawyer said the attack required "significant planning and premeditation".
“Seflo Habibulwevic Saipov has caused injury, loss and damage to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlize, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Ferrucci, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damien Pagn<0xC3><0xA7>o.’
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has passed a decade-long trial of the death penalty.
Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, married in 1953, were sentenced to death in a New York federal trial two years ago on charges of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenberg couple were killed by an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saypov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days following the attack.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the charge sheet, Saipov told investigators that after seeing the video of Jesus on his mobile, he was inspired to attack.
Police said he also asked for the flag to be placed in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "completely disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
Patton said: "We believe that the death penalty should be fixed, accepting any demand for life imprisonment is to aggravate the suffering of all those involved in this incident.
Saipov's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to award the death penalty.
MP Tory says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
During the protest at the Tory Conference, Nigel Farage vowed to form an "army of the people."
The former U.K. leader said that politicians should have a flurry of Eurosceptics - as suggested by Theresa May's MP, they should have the formula for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Peter Bone told the crowd in Birmingham that if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary, by now the UK would have "got out of here."
However, with the supporters of the Remen Tories protesting against Brexit in the city, the barriers to Mrs May's grouping have become more apparent.
Even in a storm of criticism from Brexitors, the EU and the rest of the world, they have to learn to keep their checkers on their promises.
The Allies say that despite the opposition, they should try to establish relations with Brussels and put pressure on the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose one from their plan or "blur."
Mr. Bone made it clear before the Leave Mines Live Rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'end his relationship with the Checkers'.
He also suggested that Mr. Farage should have been accompanied and held responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
If they had, we would have been out by now," he said.
Wellingboro MP said: "I will stand by Brexit, but we have to get the checkers out."
Regarding his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not participate in the war to get a second place."
We need laws in our country.
Denying that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 election, Mr. Bonn said: "The idea that the British people have changed their views, their demands, and now they want to live in the system is wrong."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins was also present, telling reporters: "All I will say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
There is anger among the general public about the checkers, the opposition will not vote for them, our party and our workers who have designed this route to elect us to the highest position, there is also an atmosphere of opposition to the checkers.
Please continue to read and listen to the opinions of others.
In a clear message to Smt. May, she said: 'The Prime Minister can hold his office only if he keeps his words.
Addressing the rally, Mr Faraaz said that politicians who want to betray the 2016 general elections must face the consequences.
Now it has become a matter of trust between our people and our political class, he added.
They're going to betray Brexit and we're going to tell them right here, right now, that we're not going to let you do that.
Addressing an enthusiastic crowd gathered here, he said: "I think you should teach this lesson to our politicians who want to betray Brexit."
“We are building an army of the people of this country. It is this army that will lead us to victory in Brexit, and this army will not be healthy until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
The protesters marched for two hours in Birmingham before marching towards the city centre.
A group of activists set up a group to protest against the Tories against Brexit.
Lord Adonis, considered a friend of the Labour Party, took the Conservative Party to the edge over the security issues contained in the party's app as the conference began.
These are the same people who tell us that the IT system is working properly and all these technologies will lead to Canada plus plus, peace on the border, free trade without borders with Ireland, and so on," he said.
This is all creation.
There is no such thing as a fair Brexit,” he added.
Warren will be seriously considering contesting the presidential election.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November elections.
According to the Boston Globe, Democrats from Massachusetts were talking about their future plans during a townhall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has consistently defended President Donald Trump, is running for re-election against GOP State Representative G of DL in November. G of Trump was also co-chair of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There are already speculations that he will run against Trump in the 2020 election.
This was Trump's 36th meeting with voters following the townhall system in Holliday on Saturday.
A member of the audience asked him if he was going to run for president.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington to prove their disgruntled government, and that also means being a woman in the highest office."
One arrested in LSU sims murder case
The Baton Rouge, LA police announced on Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said the 20-year-old Deteon Simpson was arrested at an ET news conference at 11 a.m.
Police released a video of the shooting and urged people to identify the person seen in the video footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the University of Southern California campus on Friday morning.
"Yade Sims was shot in the head and died," Murphy J. Paul, police chief, told the media.
Wade fell in to save his friend and was shot by the Simpsons.
During the police interrogation, Simpson has admitted that he was at the spot at that time, had a weapon and that he had fired at the Wyde Sims.
Simpson was easily arrested by the police and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, where he played 32 games, 10 of which started last season. His average rate is 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds.
Lewis Hamilton beats Sebastian Vettel to win Russian Grand Prix
It was only on Saturday when the Valtteri Bottas qualified with more points than Lewis Hamilton that it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team will now be important in this tournament.
Bottas had a good start from the pole, taking Hamilton's place in the first two turns and he had almost taken Hamilton out, so it was time for Vettel to beat a player from his own team.
Wettel went into the pits first, leaving Hamilton in traffic at the end of the pack, and this action should have been decisive.
Mercedes then went on to win the race to the back of Vettel. However, after some very interesting moments, Hamilton went ahead and the Ferrari driver was forced to take the risk of a double move for the third place with an unwillingness to let himself in.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first leg of the competition, which was held on his 21st birthday.
After that, he took most of the competition further in his car, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally got into the pits in the 44th lap, but with Raikonen in fourth place, he was unable to increase his speed.
It was a really tough day. Valtteri did a great job and he is very gentlemanly.
The team has done well to get one-two,” Hamilton said.
This is really bad behaviour
Senator Dianne Feinstein has said she did not bring out a letter from Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President directly referred to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee without referring to the testimony given by Ford that what is going on in the Senate is clear from what is going on in the Senate that how many people have become 'selfish, irritable and liars'.
"What's going on in the Senate over the last few days is what's going on, what's going on out there... When you see the anger there, you see these people are angry, they're angry, they're selfish and they're liars."
"You look at the publicity sheets, leak it and then say, 'Oh... I'm not.'
I did not do it."
Do you remember?
"Dennis, did you do this?
He remembers his answer... Did you leak these documents... “What, what are you saying?”
Oh, no.
I didn't lock it up."
Oh, wait a minute.
Why did we leak it...no, we didn’t do it,” the president said in a Senator style.
In July, Ford sent a letter to Feinstein about the allegations against Kavango, which were leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the letter had been leaked from his office.
I have not concealed Dr Fords allegations, but I have not leaked his letter, Feinstein told the committee, The Hill Reporter reported.
They told me to keep it a secret and I kept it.
However, his refusal did not please the president. He said at a Saturday night meeting: "I tell you, this is very bad behavior."
Maybe they didn't, but that's the worst thing I've ever seen."
Appearing for the Supreme Court representative who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President said that these Democrats are using these allegations to their advantage.
They need to do something to regain power.
You see the selfishness, the dishonesty, they don't care who's hurting anyone, they don't even want to see who's fighting for power and dominance," he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars defeated the Belfast Giants 5-3 in an Elite League match on Saturday.
Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bolivar scored early to give the Giants a two-goal lead.
Before Dwyer took the lead again, the hosts were leveled by Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalised Dundee and then Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's goal led to the team's victory.
This was Adam Keefe's third defeat in the Elite League this season, having beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth encounter between the two teams this season. The Giants had won the last three matches.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the 3:35 minute, four minutes before the start of the game, with the help of Kendall McFaul. Four minutes later, Bovliar doubled the lead with the help of David Rutherford.
The start of the match was full of developments. Sullivan kept the hosts' challenge alive with a goal in the 13:10 minute, followed by Matt Markardt's help in the 15:16 minute.
Towards the end of the first session, Dwyer scored his second goal to give the Giants a lead in the first break.
"Jayman again strategized the team and in the 27:37 minute Bokard scored a power play goal to bring the team back into the tie."
Cooney and Charles Corcoran came together to help Nilsson score the goal and Dundee got the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second session.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will now face Milton Keynes at their home ground on Friday.
Air traffic controller who saved hundreds of passengers from earthquake dies
HYDERABAD: Indonesia's aviation regulator has confirmed that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers has landed safely.
At least 800 people have been killed and many more are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The entire area has been devastated by the devastating earthquake and many people have been trapped under the rubble in Palu city.
The control tower at the Mutiyara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu was shaken by the earthquake. The 21-year-old Ant<0xC3><0xB3>nio Gu<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xA1>n Ag<0xC3><0xB3>n refused to leave his position, even though the other co-passenger left the building for fear of life.
Batik Air Flight 6321 was on the runway at the time and did not move from its seat to allow the aircraft to fly safely.
He then jumped from there after he realised that the traffic control tower was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
His decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Serrat told ABC News in Australia.
We had arranged a helicopter at Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We were shocked to hear this,” he said.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could cross the 1,000 mark, saying it is difficult to reach all parts of the cities of Donggla, Singi and Botong, according to the emergency management agency.
"The death toll is likely to rise further, as many bodies are still buried under the debris and we have not been able to reach there," an agency spokesman said.
The city of Palu has been ravaged by waves reaching a height of up to six meters. On Sunday, mass burials will be held in the city of Palu.
Military and commercial aircraft are providing relief and essential supplies.
"Ressa Kusuma, a 35-year-old woman, told Sky News: ""Every minute, the carcasses are coming with the bodies."
Clean water is scarce.
There are small markets all over the world."
Jan Gelfand, head of Indonesia's International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what exactly they're going to do there."
The situation is already very sad, but it can be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete everything related to the deportation.
"Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Earlier this year, an earthquake in Lombok, Indonesia, killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after a plane crash in the Gulf.
The airline, which operates a plane that crashed in the Gulf of Micronesia, has now said that one passenger is missing after the crash and that 47 passengers and crew on board the plane have been safely evacuated.
According to a press release issued by Air Niugini, the airline has not received a single male passenger as of Saturday afternoon.
"We are working with local agencies, hospitals and investigative agencies to find the person,"" the airline said."
When asked for more details such as the passenger's age or nationality, the airline did not immediately respond.
While trying to land at the airport on the wrong island, the plane fell into the water and locals helped rescue the passengers and staff.
Seven people have been taken to hospital, officials said on Friday.
Six of the passengers were in hospital on Saturday and all of them are in stable condition, the airline said.
The cause of the crash and the exact cause of the accident are yet to be ascertained.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane landed before reaching the runway.
Some of them seem to have flown the plane.
U.S. passenger Bill Jensen said the plane went down too much.
Jones said: "It was a good thing.
Janice said she and the other passengers got out of the sinking plane by way of an emergency exit and walked through the waist-deep water.
He stated that the crew members of the aircraft were terrified and were shouting, they also stated that they had received minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said some sailors had been working to repair the damage, and that they had taken people from the inflatable boat to the shore before the plane sank. The plane then sank 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Aviation Safety Network has reported that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline crashes in the last two years.
The woman was burnt alive on the night of the incident.
The ruling party on Saturday concluded its arguments in a case involving a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, a US Justice Department analyst, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, who died the night before, explained to the jury how the cellphone records were checked to find out exactly what happened between her and the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis.
Rowlatt said they collected and examined location data of several cellphones to determine that Chambers was with her that evening when she died. Telus has previously claimed that he was not with her that evening. Clarion Ledger reported the news.
As per available data, his cellphone appears to have been near the cellphone of the chambers at that time, and Telus said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford at that time. The police then went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford appeared before the court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
The prosecutor asked Sanford about the fact that Telis was claiming to be in a Sanford truck that night. He said that Telis was lying on it. He said that his truck was in Nashville at the time.
Another difference is that Chambers had known her for two weeks before she died, Teles said.
From the records of cellphones, it appears that they had started knowing each other only a week ago.
After Chambers' death, Teles deleted her messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
"She saved my life," he said.
The defense will begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The case is expected to come up for hearing on the same day, the judge said.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
Filled with positive messages, Hip-Hop Trio wants to challenge the negative view of this genre of music.
High Breed in Bristol has claimed that Hip Hop is disconnected from its original purpose of handling political messages as well as social issues.
They want to get back to their roots and restore Conscious Hip Hop to popularity.
Artists from groups such as Fugis and Common have seen the rebellion in the UK through artists such as Akali and Loki.
Another black person?!
A nanny in New York pulled up a couple in court for dropping out of work on the basis of a "racist" message
"The message that she is ""another black person"" is being dragged to court by a New York-based nanny couple for being fired after her mother mistakenly sent her a racist message."
The couple has denied the allegation of discrimination, claiming that the case was a case of "fraud".
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, disliked the fact that she was black when she first came to work in 2016 to look after her children.
"Nassssssssssssssssssssssssss is another black man," Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending the message to the husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After noticing this confusion, the 'missing' Pasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, the former nanny of ours who was African-American and was doing a bad job.
Mrs. Morris was paid one day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Now Mrs. Morris is dragging the couple to court for a pay cut. They are demanding $350 a day for a six-month period. They were hired with a promise to stay full-time. However, no agreement has been reached.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he told the Post newspaper on Friday. "I know, it's racism," she added.
The concerned couple has dismissed the claim that they are racist. It is no longer possible to trust Mrs. Morris because of her injury. In such a situation, the couple has claimed that their dismissal is justified.
"My wife sent them what she didn't want to say."
It's not racism.
We are not racists," her husband, Joel Plasco, said.
"But, after you've been rude to someone, will you hand over the children to the same person? Then why should it be rude?"
Do you want to give your baby to that person?
It's not possible."
Alleging that the case was a "genocide" type, Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months ago and that she was currently in "a very difficult situation."
"Does anyone follow someone like that?"
"This is not a good thing," said Plasco, who is an investment banker by profession.
Although the case is still pending in court, the court of public opinion has left criticism on the couple through social media.
The concern that readers would not be able to accept the idea of a speaking bear was disturbing to Paddington publishers, a new paper has revealed.
Soon after the book was accepted, Bond's daughter Karen Yankel said of the letter: "It's hard to understand the state of mind of anyone reading it for the first time before it's published."
It's interesting to see what we can learn from the success of the program."
After working as a cameraman at the BBC, the father, who was inspired by a little bear to play with, would have been optimistic even if the book had been rejected, she says. The book’s 60th anniversary of its publication has been “mixed” with his death last year.
She described Paddington as "a very important member of our family". She also said that her father was very proud of the success he had achieved in the end.
"He was very calm. He never wanted to play his own team," she said.
"But Paddington was like a real existence for them, so if our son has had some success, we're really proud of that, even though we don't have that accomplishment.
I think that's the way they see the success of Paddington.
It was his creation and his imagination, yet he always attributed it to Paddington."
My daughter was on the last lap and I had to call her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was taken to the Lou Pasteur II Hospital, Nice, where the doctors tried to save her but in vain.
"Nad used to call me regularly and tell me that the situation is very bad. I don't think she will come out of it," said hundred.
"Then I got a call from Ned and he said she's going to die in the next two minutes and I want to say goodbye to her.
And I made it clear to her.
I said, "I love you, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
Im with you.
The effect of the drugs given to her by the doctor to continue pumping her heart was gradually decreasing and all her systems were shutting down.
He died a short time ago, and it was all gone.
I just wanted to sit and wait and see if everything was going to work out.
I could not cry, I could not cry, I could not cry, because there were so many families and people around me.
I really had to save myself."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Lapraus sat down with the other passengers in the plane, mourning the loss of their daughter, who had no idea what she was going through.
"Nobody knows," he said.
"I was down the neck and was constantly opening tears from my eyes.
It’s a bit difficult to explain, but I was feeling a sense of empathy for Ned when I was on the plane.
I wanted him to know my love.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women in distress post cards to avoid bridge suicides.
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide are now working to save the others.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries post cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers on the Welsh Bridge. People can get help by calling these phone numbers.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, had been depressed since he was 13 and ended up killing himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want my parents to have to deal with what I'm going through every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, lives in Lidney, an emerging chef with a smile on her face.
“Everyone knew him for his smugness.
He always had a smile on his face."
But he quit his job before he died, because he had "really lived in obscurity."
Tyler committed suicide in 2014, when his 11-year-old brother found him dead.
Mrs. David said: "I'm kind of worried it's going to have some indirect impact on him."
Mrs. David created the cards, "To make people aware that there are people you can go to, people you can talk to. They can be any of your friends.
You don’t have to be quiet—you have to be quiet.”
Mrs. Humphreys and Mrs. Davis have been friends for many years. Mrs. Humphreys lost their 15-year-old partner Mark. He also ended himself shortly after his mother's death.
"He never said he was disappointed, disappointed, said nothing," she said.
Over the course of the next couple of days, we noticed a slight change in his attitude.
He didn't have any money in his pocket on Christmas Day - when the kids were opening their presents he avoided prying eyes at them."
She said her death was a huge shock to her family, but we got out of it. "It created a rift in the family.
It broke up between us.
We just have to keep fighting and keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is a little bit left as the FBI begins an investigation
"I thought, if we really got something like what he was asking for - a certain period of time of investigation, a limited opportunity - then maybe we could bring in a little bit of unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared he was "broken" by getting used to the committee partyson gridlock.
Why does Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
It is only because of their lack of time.
With just six weeks to go for the midterm elections, that's on November 6 - if the Republicans' performance goes as bad as expected, their efforts to send a man elected to the nation's highest court will be much weaker.
Mr. Kavanaugh picked up the phone to call George W. Bushini Senators to build a plank of support for Mr. Kavanaugh. Mr. Kavanaugh was working for Mr. Bush in the White House, and it was through him that Mr. Kavanaugh met his wife, Ashley, when Ashley was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI releases a report?
Fifty-one Republicans and 49 Democrats will vote in the Senate.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, vice president, to equalize and retain him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un has "reduced" the number of infiltrators
South Korean lawmakers say the number of North Korean infiltrators has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Citing data from the South Unification Ministry, Park Byong-sung said there were 1,127 infiltrators last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and more money being taken from human traffickers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A large number of North Koreans have been granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that by the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans had illegally crossed the border.
Many people live in China, which has a large border with North Korea, and crossing the border is easier than crossing the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers infiltrators to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and sends them back forcibly.
Relations between the North and the South - although still technically at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss negotiations on the non-use of nuclear power.
This came after US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un held a historic meeting in Singapore in June to discuss a wide range of issues on the nuclear-weapon-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho slammed the US for the lack of progress since then.
“Without any faith in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such a situation, we will not be able to disarm ourselves unilaterally,” Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "unconscious" and says he is unable to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court-directed candidate Brett Kavanaugh "unconscious" and said he had been unable to serve on the Supreme Court for some time.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin on Saturday.
"I can't do anything about it, but it seems that if a woman did it, they would call her 'Bebhan'," Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh had become very fractious when he started talking about his family and his high school days.
He accused the Democrats of being "bizarre and a coordinated murder of character" when they came together to express their anger over Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's evidence proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, as it proved that he was biased in the case of the Democrat.
"I think they have disqualified themselves with their statements and following Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
She appeared reluctant when asked if Pelosi would question her legitimacy if Kavanaugh was appointed and if the Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives.
"All I will say is - if they don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then they don't deserve to be in the Supreme Court, not just the court they are in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is presently a Judge in the Appellate Circuit Court of D.C.
Pelosi said she, as a Democrat, was concerned about Kavanaugh's Affordable Care Act or Rowe V. Wade's handling of his possible claims against him, as Kavanaugh was considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh dropped questions about whether he would miss some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"This is not the time to expect an innocent, partisan man to go to court and hear from us, 'Oh, how wonderful!'" Pelosi said.
Women need to use their arms.
This right voice has been raised, months and years have passed and she had no choice but to cry.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me after 45 years.
"I don't think this is normal, what do you think?"
She continued, “Somewhere I was supported by a woman working as an executive, she said that she was so angry that she would cry, but she developed a technique that when she started to scream and cry, she would say to the person who was talking, ‘You think I’m crying because I’m sad.’
I was angry."
And then he continued.
And I thought it was outstanding."
Tears are allowed as a downer of anger because there are fundamental misconceptions about them.
One of my fondest memories of my early job was in a male-dominated office, where I once saw an elderly woman - a cold-blooded manager who I was always afraid of - grabbing my neck and dragging it to the wall of the zenith.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy for that."
Patricia Schroeder, a woman from the Democratic Congress in Colorado, worked with Gerry Hart for the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business, Mrs. Schroeder was very disappointed and wondered why she would not stand up for herself in the presidential election.
“It wasn’t an easy decision to make,” she said with a laugh.
"There are already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they want is one more candidate.
Some have called it "Snowwhite and the Seven Dorfs."
"They were behind in raising funds because of the delay in the campaign and so they decided that they would not get into this fight until they had collected $2 million."
It was a losing battle.
She found out that her supporters gave her $250 for the men who gave her $1,000.
"Do they think I'm relaxed?" she thought to herself.
They were so excited when they announced that they would not launch a formal campaign - their gratitude for the people who supported them, their enthusiasm for a system that made it difficult to raise money, and their anger about representation and sexuality - instead of targeting voters.
"You might have thought I was heartbroken," Mrs. Schroeder said of the symbols given to her by the newspapers.
"You might have thought that Kleinx was my corporate sponsor.
I wonder what he's going to write on my wall.
"Why did she cry?"
How the trade war between the U.S. and China could benefit China
Experts say the trade war between the U.S. and China, with no sign of an end to the war, could benefit Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
There has been a massive increase this week with new tariffs impacting the value of $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has resisted every time by imposing tariffs of 5-10 per cent on imports, compared to the most recent $60 billion in US goods.
China has vowed to follow in the footsteps of the United States and soon the world's largest economy will not be ignored.
Withdrawing from Washington would mean meeting demands, but publicly greeting the US would be very uncomfortable for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing is able to play its game properly, China will be able to provide positive long-term support by reducing the interdependence of the two economies under pressure from trade wars in the US.
In fact, the economic boom that will begin in either Washington or Beijing if a quick political decision is made is more dangerous than what people have previously accepted," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
The Syrian government says it is "prepared" for the return of the refugees.
Syria is ready to voluntarily return refugees and has asked for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, with the progress made in fighting terrorism, the situation in our region is more stable and secure," he said.
In order to improve the general situation, the Government has started rehabilitation of areas destroyed by terrorists.
The situation is now well-prepared for the voluntary repatriation of refugees who had to leave their country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people in the country still need philanthropy.
Al-Mulayem said the Syrian government would help rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from the countries that provide armed assistance.
The European Cup of Champions in Paris
At Le Golf National outside Paris, France, the European Union defeated the United States in the final of the 2018 Ryder Cup by 16.5 to 10.5 points.
The U.S. has lost six times in a row in the European country and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team defeated the United States by 14.5 points to win the European crown.
American star Phil Mickelson struggled in a number of tournaments, immersing his T-shot in the water with a par-3 16th hole to face Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari became the first of four players to shine in all four of his tournaments, taking a 5-0 lead since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
European champion Thorborn Olsen of Denmark knocked out American Jordan Spieth by a margin of 5-4.
The world's highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell behind England's Ian Poulter, who may have played for the final Ryder Cup, 2-1.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Sergio Garcia of Spain became the all-time European champion with a career score of 25.5.
"I don't usually cry, but there's nothing I can do today.
This is a tough year.
Thank you for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to have the cup back.
It’s about the team and I’m happy that I’m able to help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He handed over the torch to his countrymate John Rahm, who beat US golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a singles game on Sunday.
The 23-year-old said: "I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, the man I grew up watching."
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and is now 13-21-3 in his Ryder Cup career.
"A strange statistic was played by one of the greatest players of all time, Jack Nicklaus winning only 14 major titles."
With the exception of high-capacity golfers Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, the USA team travelled throughout the weekend to find a fairway.
US captain Jim Furyk commented on the disappointing performance of his team, saying, "I'm proud of these people, they fought."
This morning, we had the opportunity to visit the European Union.
We were fighting.
Greetings to Thomas.
He is a good captain.
All 12 teams played well.
"We will match the team again, I will work with the PGA and Ryder Cup Committee of America and we will move on.
I love these guys and I'm proud to be a part of them.
You have to praise them.
We went out.”
Red Tied Update: Significant decrease in concentrations of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarsota
According to the latest report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, there has been a general decline in red-tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, the condition of patchier blooms in Pinellas, Monte, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties is being reported - which reduces concentrations.
Red Tide has extended a 130-mile coastline from North Pinlas to Southern Lee Counties.
