Welsh Assembly members are worried about ‘mapping’ themselves
Several members of the House of Representatives have expressed concern about the change in their designation to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this fear is the proposal to change the name of the Assembly to the Wessex Parliament.
Members of the House of Representatives of various political parties are afraid to face ridicule over the name change.
A Labour party member said his party was "concerned that the new post resonated with the Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Welsh: In the Welsh language, Twp means fool and Pwp means feces.
A Plaid Assembly member said they were "not amused" as a team and suggested an alternative.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said the party saw the name change as "open-minded" but noted that there was little difference in pronunciation between the MWP and the maple.
In this sense, the pronunciation of the Wesh letter W is similar to the pronunciation of the U in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently making provisions for the start of the name change process, said: "The members must make the final decision about what will happen to the designation of the members of the Assembly."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 grants the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public vote in which a proposal to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament was widely supported.
Regarding the designation of Assembly members, the Commission is supported by the Welsh Parliament Member or WMP, but the MWP received the most support in the referendum.
Apparently, the members of the Assembly are suggesting different options, but it will be difficult for the presiding officer, Ellen Jones, to reach a consensus, which is supposed to submit a draft of the provisions within a few weeks.
This provision of reforms will have various changes in the procedure of the Assembly, including disqualification of the members of the Assembly and design of the committee system.
After the debate on this provision, the members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to vote on what their position should be.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was held to avoid a decades-long conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbor's name is a symbol of its claim to the region and has repeatedly objected to the country's application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Macedonia's president, Georg Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would reject the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, feel that the change of name is only a step needed to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's Falls Church is on fire
"The older people I spoke to said that historically there was a church and a bar in every corner," Adams said.
"There's none of that today."
He said that it is understandable that the barbecue is disappearing.
Today, people's lives are shaped in different ways.
“The barns are no longer the living room of the area where everyone goes on a regular basis.”
In the case of the church, he is worried that the money that the property sold will not last as long as the leaders think, “And today and tomorrow, they will go back to where they started.”
He added that apartment buildings and condominiums could be built in place of the church, where people would live who would not help the rest of the area's places of worship.
"The majority of those who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and so they will hasten the closure of these churches because the majority of the people who live in these condominiums are less likely to be members of the church."
Both churches were founded by white congregations before Harlem became a black-dominated metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white Methodist Church left the church in 1930.
A nearby church took possession of the building.
The Reverend John Howard took over St. Martin's, a black congregation under Johnson, who led a boycott against retailers on A Hundred and Twenty Fifth Street for refusing to hire and promote black workers - a major street for shopping in Harlem.
The building was badly damaged in a fire accident in 1939, but when the parish residents of Father Johnson's parish planned to restore it, they arranged for the carillon to be built.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's, proudly gave the Carillon the title of "Poor Man's Bell."
The expert who played Carillon last July, he called it something different: "a historical resource" and "an irreplaceable historical musical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Nyong of the University of Michigan, also said that it was a black orthodontic carillon served on Earth by Bajan Dionio A. Lind, who joined the Riverside church 18 years ago to play a larger carillon.
Mr. Marriott said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martins over the past few months is a complex affair between architects and contractors who are appointed by church leaders or episcopal dioceses.
Vestry – the parish’s governing body consisting of general leaders – reported their concerns in July last year that they thought Diocesan Vestry would “transfer close costs”, although Vestry was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by Diocese.
Some members of the parish have complained of a lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
In California, a 13-year-old was injured after being hit by a shark
A 13-year-old boy has been injured in a shark attack after he drowned to catch a molten shrimp on the first day of the molten shrimp season on Saturday, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. at Beacons Beach near Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told San Diego's KSWB TV that he heard the boy's cries for help while he was drowning with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning and helped a group of people to get him out of the water by pedaling there.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was shouting at the joy of holding a lump of shrimp, but then, "you know, the boy's been biting me!"
“It bites me!”
His voice was hoarse," said Hamel, as he reached for the boy.
"I scream for everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to the Raidy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark has not been identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told a news briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but that it was not a dangerous species.
Gilles said the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper part of his torso.
Officials have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swamey in Encinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons and investigations.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which are not dangerous.
SENSBERIS is planning to enter the UK market
Sensberis Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams are set to compete in the department store-like cosmetics aisles and shop businesses with expert support staff.
As part of the UK’s efforts to enter the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, these large beauty Isles will be launched in 11 stores nationwide and will be rolled out in other stores if proven successful. The UK’s beauty market continues to grow where the market for fashion and home decor essentials has fallen.
This investment in beauty is coming as supermarkets are once again looking for new ways to fill shelves filled with TVs, microwaves and home furnishings.
Sensberis said it would double the amount of its morphological content to 3,000 products, including Revlon, Easy, Tweezerman and Doctor P for the first time.
The already existing range of cosmetics such as L'Oreal, Mebelin and Barts Biz will have more space, including a separate space for brands such as Boots.
The supermarket is launching its boutique makeup range so that most of the products are vegan friendly – which has become very popular among young buyers.
In addition, perfume seller The Fragrance Shop will run product delivery tests at two Seinsberis stores, the first of which was launched last week in Croydon, South London, and the second one will be launched later this year at Sally Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping online and buying small amounts of food in local grocery stores means supermarkets are having to put in extra effort for buyer gatherings.
Mike Cooper, chief executive of Sevensburys, said the outlets should look like department stores as the supermarket chain is competing with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl, and that there will be more services and non-food products.
Sensbaris has been setting up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened a few Habitats since it bought two Argos and Habitats chains two years ago, which have increased sales of groceries and made the acquisition more profitable, the company claims.
Earlier attempts to decorate the supermarket's facade and pour out the pharmacy department had failed.
Sinesburys tested a joint project with the first Fike Boots of the 2000s but the project was shut down due to a conflict over how the profits from chemist shops in supermarkets would be shared.
Sinesbaris is adopting this new strategy after it sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Lloyds Pharmacy owner Celesio.
The company said that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding a luxury range of skincare brands, including La Roche Posey and Veshi in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sensberis’ commercial director, said: “We’ve changed the sails of our Isles to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in hiring specially trained staff who will be present to give advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet all kinds of needs and due to the attractive environment and convenient location, we have now become a reliable morphological destination that will challenge the old methods of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'fires' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
TV presenter Holly Willoughby has cancelled a deal with Dragon's Den star Peter Jones' lifestyle brand to focus on her new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
They don't have enough time for their home and pet peeves.
The business of this pair is compared to the Gineth Paltro's Goop brand.
The morning presenter, 37, announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute – aiming to focus on his new bumper deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones became a "firebrand" when in an interview with his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday, the TV's golden girl admitted that she had no time for home furnishings and accessory brand Trully because of her new deal - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The business was compared to Gineth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million net worth.
After Willoughby, 37, announced his departure from Truly on Instagram, Jones left Britain on a jet for his holiday residence.
A source said: "Truley has been at the top of Holly's priority list so far.
It was part of his long-term future plan that would meet his economic needs for the next few decades.
His decision came as a surprise to everyone involved.
No one could believe that the incident that took place on Tuesday, the project was supposed to be launched soon.
Marlowe's headquarters has a warehouse filled product that's ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, who is currently one of Britain's most reliable stars, could cost the firm millions of pounds because they have already invested heavily in products ranging from cushions to candles, clothing and household items, and the possible delay in its opening will add to the damage.
And this can lead to the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for over a decade.
Willoughby started with Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple are on vacation together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I Am Celebrity Show.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We won't comment on his business dealings."
It's called "And Then We Fall In Love."
He joked that after expressing a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader and making a comment that some people would consider "non-presidential."
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his "news presenter" voice.
"I didn't give up."
He said that Kim is looking forward to meeting for the second time since their initial meeting in Singapore in June. Trump claimed their first meeting was a huge step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
The nuclear disarmament talks have come to a halt.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the United States does not see any "relevant response" to North Korea's previous denuclearization move.
However, he said the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at imposing pressure.
During his speech at the rally, Trump expressed a more positive view.
"We're in a good position with North Korea," he said.
"We are at war with North Korea.
It could have killed millions of people.
We have a great relationship now."
He claims his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results — ending rocket testing, helping to free the prisoners and bring the rest of the American staff home.
And she supports the unusual way she talks about her relationship with Kim.
"The president is very easy to behave, but instead of trying to get in, there would be only 200 people in this crowded area," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
An island has been devastated by a tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign private companies were told that they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have very clearly stated that they are not requesting international cooperation, so the matter is challenging," Mr Sambang said.
Although a team is gathering to go to Save the Children's Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign workers will be able to work in the field.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palau to determine whether foreign companies would be allowed to participate in the relief efforts.
Despite the regular earthquake events in Indonesia, the country is woefully unprepared to deal with the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, other seaside shelters have seen fairs.
Despite the state of alert, a tsunami warning in Palu is clearly lacking in sirens, possibly affecting lives.
Even when the time is very good, many island trips in Indonesia are challenging.
Natural disasters make communication more difficult.
A ship is going to Palu Hospital in Lombok to take care of the victims, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the location of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo put the development of Indonesia's arid infrastructure at the center of his election campaign and he has invested huge sums of money in the construction of roads and railways.
But the lack of investment before next year's re-election has caught Mr. Joko's government off guard.
Joko is also under pressure from Indonesia's longstanding communal tensions, where the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative lifestyle of their religion.
Riots between Christians and Muslims have killed more than 1,000 people and left more than 10,000 homeless, with two groups fighting on the streets with swords, arrows and other rough weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Starz scored a beautiful equaliser in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Stars saved Liverpool from an 89-minute loss to Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Zardan Shaqiri's pass was received 30 meters away from the Stars Chelsea goalpost, while his team was 1-0 behind.
He first moved the ball to the left and then took a shot to the far post.
The shot goes over the top of the box to the right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball crossed the capa Arizabalaga and entered the net.
"It's important to get to the right position to catch the ball on time, because players like Shaq always push the ball as far ahead as possible, so I was trying to give myself as much time as possible," Starz told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I put a tap on Kent to see him come forward and there's no shot on goal without thinking too much."
Chelsea lead 1-0 in the half-time as Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute of the game.
The Blues striker passed Mateo Kovacic, then ran from midfield to enter Liverpool's half.
Kovacic went ahead with the ball in the midfield.
He then gave Hazerd a beautiful ball in the box at Liverpool's defence line.
Hazard lost the defensive players in the race and reached the goal with a shot to the left foot in the net of a distant post.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at the stadium in San Paulo, Italy, at 3pm on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people are reported to be trapped in the rubble of a building that collapsed after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck last Friday and caused a 20-foot high tidal surge, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Puro Nugro told a charter conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of 380,000, is filled with the ruins of the destroyed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of killing a woman in Churiyakaghat
A murder investigation was launched this morning after the body of a woman was found in the Barkenhead Merseyside area.
The body of a 44-year-old woman who was stabbed to death was found at John Street's Grayson Muse at 7:55 a.m. this morning, with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area to report if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would urge anyone who lives near John Street in Barkenhead to contact us if they see or hear anything suspicious."
I appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have some footage on dash cameras, to get in touch with us because they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman was a resident of Barkenhead and that her body was found inside a house.
This afternoon, friends, who believe the woman is known to them, reached the spot and asked where the woman's body was found this morning.
An investigation is underway and police said they are trying to contact the woman's relatives.
When a taxi driver in Grayson Meuse tried to enter his flat, police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was shocked to hear about the incident.
Residents were told it would take several hours to get inside.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
He said: “It’s a very sad thing.
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the barricade and another van was outside the barricade.
Inside the barricade, a group of police officers were monitoring the block of flats.
If anyone has any information, they are requested to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC or call 101 or anonymously call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 11 Log 247 of September 30.
New victim of Parliament’s Chromawell statue ‘rewriting history’
The statue will be removed by poetic justice after the Taliban destroyed many of England's cultural and religious landmarks at the hands of its fanatic followers.
But the Cromwell Society has referred to Mr. Crick's advice as "innocence" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
President of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said: "It was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's statue would become the target set up outside the Palace of Westminster in the current dislocation of the statue.
The destruction of the iconoclasm or artifacts during the English Civil War was not carried out by or under the command of Cromwell.
In the previous century, the statue of the wrong Cromwell would be discarded in the work of his predecessor Thomas.
The iconic statue of Cromwell, created by Sir William Hamo Thorncroft, is a 19th-century icon of opinion and part of a historical character that many people consider worthy of celebration.
Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph, Mr Goldsmith said: “Many people consider Cromwell to be the protector of Parliament under external pressure, in his case, against the pressure of the monarchy – which is now the opinion of fewer people but was the opinion of many in the 19th century.
But whether or not this is a completely accurate picture of the time is part of the ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the next development of our nation, and that Cromwell was a well-known character who represented a side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
A pig has killed a Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, a pig attacked a farmer in a market in southwest China and killed him.
The man, who has only been identified by his surname "Yuan," was found near a pig stable in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province of southern China in an arterial leak and blood clot, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Shining, Qinghai Province, China, was preparing to vaccinate pigs on a pig farm.
According to the report, he along with his brother Fupato came to the market on Wednesday from nearby Yunnan province for the sale of 15 pigs.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and found the door of a nearby pig stable open.
He said that there was a large male pig in the stable with blood on its face.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig had attacked and killed the farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and bruised," said Fupato Bhai, who has been identified by his surname as "U," quoted Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man is not the man or his brother.
A market manager told Evening News that police were collecting evidence at the scene and that the pig had been kept in isolation to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
Yuan's family and market authorities are in talks to determine the amount of compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been cases of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig Exxon Welsh pushed the farmer into his tractor until his wife came and drove him away in fear.
In 2012, after a farmer in Oregon ate his pig, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs were not usually aggressive but could act as "triggers or stimulants" to taste blood.
"They're just doing evil.
They bite small, very interested animals... but don't try to hurt anyone.
But you have to have enough of them," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rains across the Southwest United States
According to forecasts, the strength of the cyclone is weakening as Hurricane Rosa flows over the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, there will be heavy rains causing flooding in the northern part of Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States due to Rosa.
Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. on Sunday, with a speed of 85 miles per hour, and 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
We're heading north on Sunday.
In this direction, a strait is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean and moving eastwards towards the U.S. West Coast. On Monday Rosa Baha will hit the California Peninsula as a seasonal storm and it will push deep tropical moisture northward to the southwestern United States.
On Monday, there will be up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico due to the rosacea.
Thereafter, the system moving towards deep tropical humidity will cause heavy rainfall in the coming days across the south-west.
Locally heavy rainfall of up to 1 to 4 inches will cause dangerous flash flooding or sudden floods, torrential downpours and possible landslides in the desert.
Due to deep tropical humidity, rainfall rates can range from 2 to 3 inches per hour in many places, especially in southern Nevada and parts of Arizona.
Rainfall is likely to be between 2 and 4 inches in some parts of the Southwest, especially in most parts of Arizona.
Due to the scattered speed of the tropical rain, flash flooding and very rapid deterioration of the situation is possible.
It would be foolish to go out into the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Due to heavy rains, the canyons can become dangerous rivers and there will be strong winds, including dust, due to thunderstorms.
The storm system will cause local heavy rains in parts of the southern California coast.
The amount of rainfall can be up to half an inch, which can lead to small debris flows on shiny roads.
This will be the region's first rainy season.
There may be some scattered tropical rains in Arizona from Sunday night and Monday morning, after which the rains will increase and spread over the entire area from Monday night to Tuesday.
The heavy rain is expected to reach the fore-corners on Tuesday and continue till Wednesday.
A number of extreme temperature changes can be seen in different parts of the United States in October as the Arctic is cooling, but tropical temperatures are still quite warm.
This sometimes results in dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of a dramatic change in temperature in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa is about 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to rise and spread again.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to warm in early October, with temperatures ranging from about 80 degrees Celsius in the southern plains to the northeast.
On Tuesday, the temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees higher than the average temperature.
Our long-term climate forecasts suggest that temperatures in the eastern U.S. are likely to be much higher than average in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's voice has been heard by more than 20 million people.
The tense testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavana and Christine Blasey Ford accusing her of sexual assault, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, drew more than 20 million viewers from six television networks on Thursday.
In this direction, political disputes continue, broadcasters suspend regular shows due to the surprise of Friday's last minute: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that will give the FBI one week to investigate the complaint.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that Cavanaugh had been drinking at a high school party when he tried to open his clothes.
In an emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said he was 100 sure the incident didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, mentioned in Nielsen's report, saw Friday's event.
The company used to calculate the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other networks, which broadcast the program, were not immediately available with the number of visitors, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually faces problems in the quality of the audience seen in the office.
The number of spectators was equal to the number of the Football Playoffs or the Academy Awards.
The Fox News channel, whose opinion show's presenters strongly supported Cavan's nomination, attracted the highest number of viewers across all networks broadcasting day-long hearings with an average of 5.69 million, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS saw 3.1 million, NBC saw 2.94 million, MSNBC saw 2.89 million, and CNN saw 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Even after the hearing, there was interest.
Fleck was the central character in today's play.
After the moderate Republican's office said he would vote for Cavanaugh, he was caught on camera by CNN and CBS on Friday morning as he boarded the elevator to reach the hearings of the Judiciary Committee and protesters shouted for him.
He stood down for a few minutes in the face of the outrage of the protesters, which was broadcast live by CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think Kavanaugh is telling the truth to the country?"
She says, "You have the power, when a lot of women are helpless."
Flake said his office made a statement and said he had more to say at the committee's hearing before the lift was closed.
Later, when the Judiciary Committee votes to advance Cavan's nomination to the full Senate vote, all of the cable and broadcast networks broadcast live.
But Flake said he would vote on the condition that the FBI investigate charges against the nominee next week, which were requested by minority Democrats.
His talks with fellow Democratic Senator Chris Coon have partly influenced Fleck's decision.
After speaking with Kuhn, Fleck spoke with several other senators and reached his decision.
Flake's decision was suffocating, as it was clear that the Republicans didn't have a vote to approve Cavanaugh except for the investigation that was at hand.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation based on allegations against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing ‘politics game’ over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing a “political game” over Britain’s future and ignoring the nation’s interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview printed next to his interview on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to criticize May's so-called Checkers Plan for Brexit, saying it was "completely irrational" for Britain and the European Union to offer to collect each other's revenues.
Wade Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dayton Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities have released a video of the feud between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fighting.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said that Simpson's DNA was found in the glasses, CBS affiliate WAFB said in a report.
After his arrest, police said he had confessed to shooting and killing Wade.
According to a report by The Advocate, his bail has been fixed at $350,000.
The office of the post-mortem investigator in the East Baton Rouge area released a preliminary report on Friday, citing gunshot wounds to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The department is crediting the Louisiana State Police's Fugitive Detention Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and residents of the area for assisting in the investigation, which resulted in the arrest of the accused.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alva thanked the area's law enforcement agency for its "unremitting efforts and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-six-inch forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father played basketball for Wayne and LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"It's always a matter of concern," Wade said.
Volcano erupts in Mexico City
Volcanic eruptions from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Management Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the volcano's mouth activity increased and gas and vapor levels reached 183 on the scale within 24 hours.
The center was observing a number of roars and shakings.
Images posted on social media showed the car's windshield collapsing in areas like Mexico City's Joachimilco.
Geophysicists among them noticed an increase in volcanic eruption activity since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook Mexico in September 2017, just 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital.
The volcano known as "Don Goo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday in clashes with Riot police with pro-independence protesters as they joined opposition protesters to celebrate the first year of the vote, focusing on Catalonia's independence.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and colour powder at them in the face of police barricades, creating black clouds on the streets, usually filled with tourist gatherings.
Later in the day, clashes broke out which police used batons to stop them.
For hours, protesters chanting "Don't forget, don't forgive" faced unity supporters who chanted "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries caused by the protests, local media reported.
Tensions have been high in the independence-loving region since Madrid outlawed the October 1 referendum, which was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority of voters voted in favor of independence, although the number of voters was small because the majority of the public opposed secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were killed in violent clashes with police last year as they were prevented from voting during the region's general election.
Protesters were on the streets all night on Friday to block the march.
The protesters continued their activities but were forced to walk on different roads.
68-year-old Narcissus Termis, a power worker who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's independence.
Last year was one of the best years of our lives.
"I've seen my parents get water in their eyes, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite important but narrow victories in provincial elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain their momentum where many of their well-known leaders are awaiting trial by voluntary exile or detention for their organisation's role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is recording the protest in support of the police on her phone, said it was caused by politicians on both sides.
He added, “Instability is increasing day by day.”
Oriol Junckerus, one of the nine Catalan leaders who are not in pre-trial detention, announced late last year that he would participate in next year's European Parliament elections.
"The best way to prevent the suppression and oppression of democratic values from the Spanish government is to stand as a candidate in the European elections," he said.
LondonDerry: Man arrested after car collision with home.
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after being repeatedly hit by a car at a home in Londonderry.
The incident took place at the Ballyguard Crescent in Bangladesh at 19:30 hours on Thursday.
Deputy Inspector Bob Blimings said the gates and the building were damaged.
At some point, the car was hit and destroyed.
Menger scored a 1-0 victory over Rangers in Livingston.
Dolly Manger scored the first goal for Livingston.
Stunning the promoted Livingston Rangers, Steven Gerrard was given his second defeat in 18 games as director of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Manger made the difference as Gary Holt's team equalized with the Hibernians in the second goal.
As a result, Gerard's team remained without an away win in the Premiership this season, and on Sunday they will face the top-ranked Harts, who are eight points ahead of them.
On Thursday, Rangers Rapid will host Vienna in the Europa League.
Livingston, having already extended their unbeaten run in the division to six games, head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has yet to taste defeat.
Livingston missed a number of opportunities against his undefeated opponents.
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, as their aggressive attitude caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers!
Scott Robinson went on to break through the defense but failed to fructify his own efforts, when Alan Lithgow could only drive his effort into the wides after sliding to join Craig Halket's header.
The hosts were allowing the Rangers to play in front of themselves, knowing that guests could have trouble in set pieces.
And that was the important goal.
Rangers concocted a free-kick and opened Livingston's account of the goal. Declan Gallagher and Robinson gathered to set up Menga, who scored from the center of a touch box.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the ball possession but they considered the hosts' defense as impregnable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly spent most of the time e nirvanazhut.
This trend continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morlos blocked a shot from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was defeated at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and won another set of pieces for Livingston from Lithgow Wide.
Crosses were constantly coming into the Livingston box and were also constantly being cleared, although two penalties demands - the alternative Glenn Middleton - were dropped after Hallett's challenge and for handball.
“ The Incredible Life of Livingston
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont Tony McCarney Arena
A remarkable performance and result for Livingston.
To some people, they were great, continuing to exceed everyone's expectations in their own upward momentum.
Their playing style and players have rarely changed since their return to the top tier, but the credit goes to Holt for the way he has unified the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Hulkett was outstanding, creating a well-organized defense, and Meng Connor kept Goldson and Joe Warl always on the sidelines.
The Rangers, however, were less motivated.
They were as good under Gerard as they were under him.
They lacked the final ball - only once did they open the hosts - and that's a warning for the Rangers, who are now in the middle table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed reception in Cologne
The situation was very pleasant as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for Brexit on Saturday (29 September).
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is held with the aim of repairing relations between NATO allies.
They discussed human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then traveled to Cologne to inaugurate a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police put up a protective shield to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - were heard denouncing both Erdogan's policy and his decision to welcome him home in Germany.
This conflict demonstration proves that one visitor is hailed as a hero by the German Turks and condemned as a dictator by the others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist has been killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the link between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10 a.m.
The driver stopped the car and the cyclist was given first aid, but the man died on the spot.
The accident happened again a few months after another bicycle accident on Children's Street, which occurred about 1 mile from Saturday's crash site.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and inform his next-of-kin.
The road has been closed and bus services have been suspended and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in chaos.
Six prison officers were injured in the chaos at the high security male prison, the prison office said.
At 9.30am on Sunday, chaos broke out in HMP Long Lartin, Worcestershire, and it continues.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been brought in to deal with the chaos, which includes eight prisoners who belong to a branch.
Officers at the scene were treated for facial injuries.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the guilty will be taken under the law and they will spend longer time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals
In June it was reported that the prison administrator had gone to the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officers were called to prison to deal with a serious disturbance where staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening sudden flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City. (Although drought prone areas may benefit)
Tropical depressions are rare in Arizona, but that seems to be exactly what will happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa sweeps across the southwestern desert with the risk of flash floods with its remaining strength.
The National Meteorological Department has already issued flash flood watches for Monday and Tuesday in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, including southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, in western Arizona.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and with rain by the end of Monday.
The National Meteorological Department of Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure conditions within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!"
Katrina (1967) which was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border. "
The latest National Hurricane Center model predicts up to 2 to 4 inches of rain, in Arizona's Moglon Rim, which can be up to 6 inches in isolated amounts.
Other areas in the southwestern desert, including Central Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to receive roughly 1 to 2 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 4 inches.
The rainy season can be a blessing for people who are out of the flood risk as the areas are in a drought
Although the flooding is a very serious concern, it is likely that some of the rainfall will be beneficial as the southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to U.S. drought monitoring, more than 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme droughts, making it the second-highest category, according to Weather.com.
First, the hurricane's path will cause landslides across Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, still a strong hurricane, made a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, moving 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and 12 miles per hour north.
The storm is strengthening as it faces cold water in the Pacific Ocean.
So, it is expected to land in Mexico with the strength of tropical storms on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rains are likely to occur across parts of Mexico, which poses a significant flood risk.
"There is a possibility of up to 10 inches of rain from Baja California to northwestern Sonora"
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical depression before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning, and it will enter southern Utah via Arizona on Tuesday night.
"The major danger expected from Rosa or its remains is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwestern deserts of the United States," according to the National Hurricane Center.
These rains can cause deadly flash floods and destructive currents to flow into the desert and cause landslides in mountainous areas.
The attack on Norton in Midsummer: Four men arrested for attempted murder.
A three-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man have been arrested in Somerset on charges of attempting to murder a 16-year-old boy after he was found stabbed to death.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Axlcere Terrace area of Midsummer Norton around 4pm on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he is now in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Officers have appealed to anyone who may have mobile phone footage to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh was the victim of the Democratic Party's "cruelty, anger"
"A vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a vote to reject the brutal and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Cavanaugh had been a victim of the Democratic Party's "cruelty, anger" throughout his nomination process.
Cavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and passionately denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that she was sexually abused at her hands decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his allegations.
The President said on Saturday that “the American people saw the extraordinary and qualities and courage of Kavanaugh that day.”
He told supporters in West Virginia that a vote on behalf of Judge Cavanaugh would be a vote to protect one of the most successful legal entities of our time, a lawyer with a sterling record of public service.”
While talking about the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections, the president vaguely acknowledged Cavanaugh's nomination.
"We are just five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"Even though I'm not participating, I'm really participating," he said.
“That’s why I’m always striving to fight for great candidates.”
Trump argued that Democrats were on a mission to "prevent and impede."
The Senate's first major procedural vote on Cavan's nomination is not expected to take place on Friday, a senior associate of the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
At least 384 people have been killed and many others have been swept away by a massive wave after a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Thousands of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday for a festival when a six-metre (18-foot) high wave broke through the coast in the evening, driving many people to their deaths and destroying everything along the way.”
The tsunami came after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"Even when there was a tsunami threat yesterday, people were continuing their activities on the beach and those who could not run immediately and became victims of it," said Sutopo Puro Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses all over, it hit everything above the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled at a speed of 800 kilometers (497 miles) an hour in the open sea before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed trees to survive the tsunami, and they survived.
Around 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photos from the sky released by the disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges overturned and collapsed, and a mosque submerged in water.
On Saturday, aftershocks continued to hit the coastal city.
The quake was felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the nuclear bomb capacity of Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, could further increase the size of the tsunami
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing. "
Nugroho said the casualties and damage were likely to be higher in Dangala, an area near the epicenter of the earthquake, along the coastline 300 kilometres (190 miles) north of Palu.
The communication system was "completely crippled without any information," Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people are living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers are moving to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be worse."
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not providing information that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves came when the warning was issued.
Footage shared on social media showed a man on the top floor of the building yelling at people on the street below and warning them of a tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the shore and flooded the building and the car.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages that cut off communication around Palu and made the rescue efforts of the authorities inconvenient.
The military has started sending cargo planes to Jakarta and other cities, with authorities saying rescuers are now in great need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has only been reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed for the general public until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the Palau shelters on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's terrible.
According to Mr. Dosseba, when employees of the World Organization were safely heading to the city of Palu from Dongla, where employees were taking shelter in their office premises, they saw images of destruction on the way.
"They saw a lot of houses destroyed," Doseba added.
That's sad.
Even when aid teams were going to start disaster relief operations, some were complaining that foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu with many skills.
According to Indonesian law, foreign funding, food supplies and staff can only come when the site of a disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
But it hasn't been announced yet.
"It's still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government says yes, it's a national disaster," he said, "we can start international aid, but we haven't made any announcement yet."
Friends and family of those who went missing on the second night of Friday's tsunami in Palu are hoping for miracles that will bring hope of finding them at the end of a brutal chapter of natural disaster.
A young boy was pulled out of the rubble on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been rocking for two days next to her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, Jendon Subandono, trained two paragliders at the Asian Games, is now missing, which took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mendagi also mentioned that those who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
He added, "As a pioneer in the paragliding field, I have a responsibility to my own emotions."
Mr. Jendon recalled how the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse spread to the paragliding community hours later, he backtracked and spread it through WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors, who took part in a festival on the beach.
His message, however, was unread instead of being read.
He said, "That means the message was not sent."
The thieves stole $26,750 when they re-entered the ATM machine at Newport, Liv.
A Newport Police Department press release said the thieves stole $26,750 in the early hours of Friday while staff at Brinks kept the money at an ATM.
The driver was evacuating ATM money at the entertainment complex and was ready to pay more, Detective Denis McCarthy said at a press conference.
While he was working, another "a Brinks ran from behind the worker" and ran away with a bag full of money that was ready for handing over.
Witnesses said they saw several suspects fleeing, but police have not yet determined the number of people involved in the incident.
If anyone can identify these individuals, they are asked to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3380.
Kevin West: This rapper has changed his name to Yee.
Rapper Kane West is changing his name to Yee.
Announcing the change, he wrote on Twitter on Saturday: "Officially known as Ken West."
West, 41, was also known as Yee for some time and used the name as his surname.
The name change was announced ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he hoped to release his new album Yandy.
The show's producer said he was replacing singer Ariana Grande who canceled the show for "emotional reasons."
West had previously said the term had religious significance to him, as well as a shortened form of his current professional name.
West, while discussing the album's title with radio host Big Boy earlier in the year, said, "I believe that 'yee' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'.
"It's me, it's you, it's us, it's you.
Kane is quoted as saying that the only person, which reflects the good, the bad, our confusion, everything.
This album reflects more of our identity."
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, PDD, or DD, but this year he announced the name Love and Brothers Love.
J-G, a former West associate, has worked with Hyphen, without Hyphen, and with Capital.
Mexico's AMLO has vowed not to use military force against civilians.
Mexico's President-elect Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use military force against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday at Tolatelloco Plaza that “do not use military force to oppress the people of Mexico.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on peaceful protests that killed 300 people while the leftist student movement in Latin America was making a strong position of its own.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has apologized to young Mexicans with a monthly education allowance and support to build more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education opportunities are attracting young people to crime syndicates.
The U.S. should double its artificial intelligence funding.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should also double its spending on research in this area, said Kai-Fu Li, an artificial intelligence researcher and investor who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This quote comes from various parts of the government, declaring that the United States has a formal strategic deficit in artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China launched its new plan last year: it aims to be No. 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“The doubling of budgets in artificial intelligence research will be a good new start where most countries are far behind in this area and we are looking for the next step to advance in artificial intelligence,” Lee added.
Double funding could double the chances of the U.S. acquiring the next big artificial intelligence, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book "All Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, has invested in Face<0x2B>, one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies.
In the 1980s, Carnegie worked at Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that defeated the highest-ranked American player and was the executive of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged the previous U.S. government's technology competition, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, to determine the next steps.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee says.
"China is not evacuating academic leaders; it's giving corporates," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited luminous from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said the changes in immigration policy could help further the AI efforts in the United States.
“I think the green card should be offered automatically to PhDs in artificial intelligence,” he said. SI’s AI efforts are further enhanced.
China's State Council issued its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies spend money on U.S. researchers, but the academic work standard in China is low, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center, which means engaging industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of a selection committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DRPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF currently invests more than $100 million per year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law attempting to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen progress in months.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians on Sunday voted in a referendum on whether to change its name to the "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece that blocked attempts to gain membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is a province called Macedonia, has its northern neighbour's name representing a claim to its territory and vetoes the entry of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments reached a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Georg Ivanov said he would not vote in a referendum and cast doubt on whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid in a boycott campaign.
The question on the referendum ballot was: “You are for NATO and EU membership with the recognition of the agreement with Greece.”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, have argued for paying the price for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to join the European Union and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us," Olivier Georgijevska Skopje, 79, said in a statement.
While not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will abide by the outcome of the vote by decision-making.
A two-thirds majority is needed to change the name.
The State Election Commission said that there were no reports of irregularities till 1 pm.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the 2016 parliamentary elections, while 66 per cent of registered voters cast their votes.
"I came to vote because of my children, we have a place in Europe," said Jose Tenevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorika and his son Dushko voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which will open the way for NATO and the European Union to join in Macedonia's Strumica on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage in front of parliament in Skopje and pulling chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are on the side of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join by raising our heads, not by the door of service," Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asia solidarity.”
Prime Minister Zaev said the NATO membership would bring in the necessary investment in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after casting his ballot.
He said that a "yes" result would be our "confirmation of the future."
A survey published by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia on Monday said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum below the required turnout for the turn out.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
More than 50 percent of the vote is needed for the referendum to be successful.
The failure of the referendum will represent the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since taking power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City enter full Brighton defense for Sergio Aguero goal
England's Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday.
Aguero made it extra easy to see his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defenders before going into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He turned to a defender before overtaking several others on the edge of the Brighton box.
He then pushed a pass to the left, which found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to give the shot on the right side of the net, defeating Brighton defender Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems at his feet," city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about his game for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky that he scored a goal at that moment."
However, Sterling gave the Sky Blues the primary advantage in the Premier League battle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero found the ball deep in the Brighton area in that game.
He sent the ball to Leroy Sen through a beautiful path on the left side edge.
Sen took a few touchdowns before taking Sterling to a distant post.
Sky Blues tapped the ball in the net just before the forward crossed the boundary.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Raine-Naker-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Roger Federer wants to play in the Champions League
There was not much reason to force the Nationals to make another start after they were removed from the playoffs controversy.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the mound against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the play-offs have an impact for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the NL West.
Rockys won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night to secure at least a wild card spot, but they are still looking to earn their first-division title.
"While we're not playing for anything, at least we can step foot in the rubber knowing the atmosphere that Denver's visitors and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point I've faced this year."
Why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but there are reportedly plans to let Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start his 34th time, threw a bullpen session on Thursday and pitch in his usual rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-handed 18–7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
Speaking of the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections, the president sharply referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court-selected Brett Kavanaugh.
"Everything we've done is at risk in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"It's a big, big -- I'm not running but I'm really running so I'm all over the place to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back the energy by any means necessary, you see this lowness, ugliness.
It doesn't matter who they're hitting, who they're crushing to get power and control, they just want power and control, we don't give it to them."
He said Democrats are on a mission to "prevent and deter."
"And you've seen that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "infuriating and vile and untrustworthy."
He named Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which received loud criticism from the audience.
"Do you remember the answer?
Did you find the paper?
Uh, uh, what.
No, ah no, I wait - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labor is no longer a free enterprise.
People are not allowed to say what they think.
It's no surprise that my party's members voted for me.
Because I was the last Labour MP on the list to say that you won't be welcomed here.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan got a similar treatment because she stood firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was found guilty of disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on Europe and national security, and on similar issues, on which Jeremy did not even agree with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that “we want to make the meetings inclusive and productive.”
For the first time in my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night's GC meeting was exactly the same.
But sadly, today, this is not the tone of that meeting and the promise of "kind, gentle" politics has long been forgotten, if indeed it ever began.
It has been increasingly evident that dissent is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged as to whether it is acceptable to party leadership.
It all started immediately after Jeremy became leader, with colleagues I thought I would share a similar political view as they started expecting me to take a U-turn and take a position that I would not have agreed to under any circumstances – be it national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public — and although it doesn’t matter what I say — there are calls for me to be removed from social media, condemned to center politics, and told that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are also political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a storm of discriminatory or racist abuse on a daily basis on the basis of gender but never shy away from it.
The most disappointing aspect of this era of politics is how the scale of abuse has become normalized
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should build a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a free-thinking organization, and every "disturbed" vote or change of election rules narrows the party.
For the last two years, many people have been advising me to keep my head down, not be so vocal, and that I will be "okay."
I'm not in politics to do that.
When I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, we were provoked by thatcher government’s neglect that literally destroyed our extensive school classrooms, and I tried to provide the necessary public services to those who needed it most – whether as local councillors or government ministers.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was in any way confused about my policy position and the areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
"To those who campaigned for this movement on Friday, I will only say that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I cannot understand the willingness to waste my time and energy by showing loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I don’t really have a message for Nottingham Momentum, it’s to my constituents, to Labour members or not: I’m proud to serve you, and I promise that any threat of stalemate or political activity won’t prevent me from doing what I believe is in the best interest for all of you.
Chris Leslie is an MP from Nottingham East.
Income 38-17 Melrose: rise to the top of the unearned income
The two late attempts may have narrowed the gap a bit to the final result, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved to win the premiership match of this day's extraordinarily entertaining Tenant.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end, it was their best defense, just as good was their ability to take chances, which helped the home team win and was the perfect reason to cheer for coach Peter Murchi.
"We've been tested in every game so far and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy."
Robin Christie of Melrose says: “Iyer has to give credit, they’ve put their prospects to work better than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, converted by Frazier Clemo, put Ayre ahead, however, was a yellow card from Scotland player Rory Hughes, who expelled him for the game by the Warriors, giving Melrose a majority and Jason Baggot an unsuccessful attempt.
Climo extended Ayre's lead by scoring the penalty, just before, during the halftime, he scored in a single attempt to make the break 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's effort, converted by Bagot, reduced the gap to five points.
The game was then halted for a long time due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had been stretchered and after the restart of the game, Ayre went a lot further with the Stifford McDowell effort, which transformed Clemo.
Acting captain Blair McPherson then received a yellow card and once again punished the extra player in Melrose's Bruce Colvin attempt, after a spell of severe pressure.
Although the hosts are right back, and when Strauwen Hutchinson saw a yellow card to tackle Clemo without the ball, McPherson took a touchdown from the penalty line-out to advance to the revenue mall.
Clemo was again converted by Kyle Rowe when David Armstrong's box kick hit the ball and Flanker sent Gregor Henry out on the home side's fifth try.
Steel Game Star Restaurants Are Ready for a New Career in the Industry
Steel game star Ford Kieran has said he is ready to enter the hospitality industry after being named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star played Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he wrote himself and co-starred with longtime comedian Greg Hemphile.
Both have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the show's last series and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life after Kriegelang.
As per the list of official records, he is the Director of Adriftmore Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although Scottish Sun sources indicated that Kiernan was looking to get involved in Glasgow's "rich restaurant business."
'The sea is ours': Bolivia's landlocked country hopes the court will re-open the way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol a rigging clad naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings are flying an ocean-blue flag.
Marine bases in the Amazon from Lake Titicaca are decorated with this motto: "The sea is our right"
It's a matter of restoring it."
Everywhere in land-locked Bolivia, the memories of the coast of Harran near Chile in a bloody resource conflict of the 19th century are still vivid – just as much as the urge to sail once more into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court ruling on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has that speed, unity and serene spirit and of course we look forward to results with a positive outlook," said Bolivia's diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ ruling on the big screen across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will go in favor of Bolivia's claim that - after decades of suitable negotiations - Chile is obliged to negotiate on giving Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who will face a controversial run-off for re-election next year - also relies heavily on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts feel that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia - and even if it does, that will change little.
The Netherlands-based UN agency does not have the power to grant the territory to Chile and said it would not determine the outcome of the potential talks.
The ICJ ruling that comes just six months after hearing the final arguments indicates that the case was "not complicated," Chilean international law expert Paz Zerett said.
And instead of taking Bolivia's cause further, it may have gone backwards in the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zeret said.
Morales' anti-war speech raised any surplus goodwill in Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile may continue to talk for a while, but it will be extremely difficult to negotiate after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The Hague's Bolivian representative, former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, rejected the court's decision being unusually fast.
On Monday Bolivia will bring "an extraordinary opportunity for a new era in relations with Chile" and "to bring an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the issue of maritime as a political pole.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to enter the Pacific," he added.
"It's an opportunity to let go of the past."
North Korea has said that denuclearization will not come until it trusts the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his nation will not denuclearize first if it does not trust Washington.
He made the remarks at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to abide by the commitments made by rival leaders during a summit in Singapore.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on track to restart Singapore's stalled nuclear diplomacy with North Korea's Kim Jong Un after more than three months.
Ri said it was a "pipe dream" that continued sanctions and that the U.S.'s objections to the declaration of the end of the Korean War would devastate North Korea.
Washington cautions that Pyongyang may agree to the declaration without first undergoing a significant disarmament process.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread suspicion that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveals the Last Line of Huge Headwear on the Way to a High Street Near You
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun, there's no need to watch anymore.
Designer Valentino and Thom Brown have unveiled a series of oversized head gear for their SS19 collection on the runway that rocked the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, a very unwieldy hat has gone viral on Instagram and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations to Katowice.
One of Valentino's creations was an over-the-top beige hat decorated with wide feather-like stems that covered the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories include decorative watermelons, a wizard's hat, or even a pineapple - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown has also released a selection of bizarre masks - and just in time for Halloween.
The lips of many colored masks were similar to those of Hannibal Lector in stitching and terrifyingly funny.
One creation resembles snorkels and goggles with full scuba diving gear, the other looks like molten ice cream cones.
And if you're going to continue the huge fashion statement - then you're in luck.
Style observers have predicted that the giant bonnets could move to the high street near you.
Outsized hats compete with La Bomba, a two-foot wide-brimmed straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly impregnable hat, which has spread across social media, has sent Katwa into yet another great creation - a straw-beach bag that's almost as big as a swimsuit model.
The burnt orange Raffia bag, trimmed with Raffia fringes and a white leather handle at the top, was one of the highlights of the Paris Fashion Week at Jacquimus's La Rivera SS19 collection.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told Female: ‘I hope that next summer big hats and beach bags will arrive on High Street – since the designer has had such a big impact, the demand for oversized accessories will be hard to ignore.’
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence, and it continues to produce another outstanding test result in 2018, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for more and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as global citizens.
As an educational field that a particular school can design and implement curriculum, we continue to see modern language as a popular and preferred subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.”
If you talk to her in her own language it goes to her heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's most recent test, we can see that languages top the league tables with the highest pass rate among independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages have achieved higher grade A.
Data collected from the school of 74 members of the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent studied German, 69 percent studied French and 63 percent studied Spanish.
This proves that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now, as a matter of choice, being held in the same way as individual school curricula and elsewhere in STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17% of employers attributed a lack of language skills to the reasons employers struggled to fill vacancies.
So more and more, language skills are becoming indispensable to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are needed in a globalized world for more potential job opportunities that require language.
No matter what career they choose, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage with their lifetime skills in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people abroad automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 study by YouGov of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well during the conversation, and French was the only language in the decade-old percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important for children to invest in language education.
Having multiple languages, especially the language of the developing economy, will provide better opportunities for children to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different in their taught languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while looking ahead to 2020 will see others teach languages that are considered most important to the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, there will always be many languages to choose from at individual schools, including specialist teaching staff in this area.
Scottish Independent Schools is dedicated to providing an education environment that will prepare children and prepare them with the skills they need to succeed no matter what the future holds.
In the global business environment it cannot be denied at the moment that languages play an important role for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in the field of education.
In fact, modern languages really should be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will provide this choice, diversity, and encouragement for Scotland's young people.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make his debut at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Fans are eagerly waiting for LeBron James to make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a limited-minute game.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need a preseason game to be ready at this stage of my career," he said.
During Trump's West Virginia rally, the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump stormed a campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled rallies next week, including a stop in friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote for his election to fill the Supreme Court vacancy remains on hold, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming mid-term election, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
What time did Trump's rally in West Virginia take place tonight and how do you look online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally below via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak this week about the hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh, which has been sparked by allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected Senate confirmation vote during an FBI investigation.
But the primary goal of the inauguration of these rallies is to help Republicans gain some momentum in the face of the November election.
In this way, President Trump's campaign said that the purpose of these five rallies next week is to "emphasize volunteers and supporters, as Republicans seek to protect and expand their majority under the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters reported.
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter a busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled for Wesbenko Arena at Wheeling, today's rally could "bring back supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and bring coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
This is Trump's second visit to West Virginia since last month, winning the state by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in the polls, ahead of the election.
"It's not a very good sign for Morrissey that the president has to try to encourage him in the election," said Simon Heder, a West Virginia University politician, according to Reuters.
World Cup 2018: Team USA is struggling to keep their hopes alive in Sunday's singles
The first round of the tournament was held on Saturday afternoon after three one-sided sessions.
The swing of the pendulum of the Momentum is a completely invented sports concept but in it the players really believe, and most of all in such competitions.
Where are they going to put the mozzarella?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we have a little momentum now," Jordan Spieth said.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with 12 more games remaining, leading by four points.
As Spieth said, Americans think they have some help along the way and they can be encouraged by a lot of things, especially the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and they both took four to three points.
Smith has been brilliant from start to finish and has been leading from the front.
As his round went on, the shouts of celebration were getting louder, as he and Thomas were still two points behind after scoring two, making important strides to grab the full four-point square match.
His jug that won them the match at 15 got the same kind of shouts, which tells you a lot that he believes the American team is not out of it.
"You have to really go deep and think about your own game," he said.
That's all the players have now.
There are 18 holes for one mark.
The player who got more points in the last two days than Speedh and Thomas is just the indiscriminate story of Francisco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but adorable pair can't make four to four and no mistakes.
"Mollywood" was the only pair that didn't shoot any bogeys on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bogeys at the back nine on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy was flowing towards and from this enthusiastic crowd, seemed like they were the players who were defeated on Sunday, and as the sun set on Le Golf National there was no other potentially popular player to seal a European victory without Fleetwood or Molinary.
It would be better if both were in different positions at the same time.
However, the glory of Europe is in the air.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson had some problems for morning foreball hero Sergio Garcia when they teamed up with Alex Norren.
The first nine had a bogey and two double spaniards and dropped the Swedes into a hole from which they had never been able to get up.
On Sundays, though, there's no one to get you out of your hole.
It is very interesting to see the closeness of Foreball and Foursome due to the mutual interaction between the pair, the advice that they give, the advice that they do not give, and the strategy that can be changed immediately.
Europe played relatively well as a team so far and took an important lead on the final day but this foursome session further proved that Team USA's hunger for the fight was something that, in particular, Stateside suspected.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will take a healthy advantage by taking a 10-6 lead against the United States from Saturday's Foreball and Foursome matches.
Encouraged pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari have now taken their tally to four points in the golf national, leading to two wins against two washed-out Tiger Woods.
Thomas Journe's European team, bidding to recover the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, won the series 3-1 by blowing up the flawed American side in the morning foreballs.
The U.S. offered more resistance in Foursome, winning two matches, but they could not fill the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to recover the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari, together "Milwaukee" are only the second pair to score four points from the first four matches in Ryder Cup history after an extraordinary weekend.
Grinding Woods and Patrick Reid into a four-ball, they then went on to beat Woods at a loss and American Rookie Bryson Deckambue by a much more emphatically 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled himself out of both games on Saturday, sometimes took the brunt of the heat, but now lost 19 of his 29 Foreball and Foursome games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting for the morning foreplay, returns to Foursome partner Henrik Stenson for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka's 2 and 1 defeats - the world's No. 1 and No. 3.
On a lovely, windy day on the south-west side of Paris though it wasn't on its own in Europe.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They had a strong 2 and 1 win over Spain's Jon Ram and Ian Polter in the 4th round, and were back to beat Polter and Rory McLorry in the 4th and 3rd, losing the opening two holes in the 4th.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team returned from a four-point deficit in a singles event, although as of now only a draw is needed to recover the trophy on Furyk's side.
After being second best for two days, however, Sunday's counter-attack looks like it will surpass them.
North Korea has said it will not unilaterally denuclearize without "belief in any way."
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that existing sanctions deepen the distrust of the United States and that in such a situation, there is no chance for the country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea last year took "significant salutary steps" such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear laboratories, and pledging not to increase the proliferation of nuclear technology and nuclear weapons.
“But we didn’t see any similar reaction in the United States,” he said.
“If there is no trust in the United States, we will have no confidence in our national security, and in such a situation, there is no way for us to unilaterally disarm.”
Although Ri was describing North Korea's accusations against Washington's "levelling" approach to nuclear disarmament that it would be rewarded for its slow moves, his remarks appeared significant because he did not unilaterally exclude nuclear disarmament altogether, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri noted a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" and when Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. has insisted on “disarmament-first” and has raised the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their objectives with impunity, even objecting to the declaration of “the end of the war,” Ri says.
"The idea that restrictions can plunge us into the ground is an ominous dream for those of us who don't know."
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our distrust.”
There was no comment on plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US head of state highlighted at the United Nations earlier in the week.
The minister instead referred to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months: “If this disarmament issue had been South Korea without the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have been so stalled.”
Yet, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korean rockets was inevitable when "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" by suicide.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to denuclearize, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said on Wednesday that there was no time limit for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months to do it - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded for actions taken by the UN Security Council
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Americans on Thursday that the Security Council should “continue to effectively enforce the Security Council’s sanctions until we fully realize the ultimate verifiable disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously extended sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rie at the United Nations General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not gone well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said some progress had been made, only hours before North Korea condemned him for making "goons-like claims"!
North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex at a meeting with Moon this month if the United States takes "similar measures."
He said the "actions" that Kim was looking for were the security guarantees that Trump had given in Singapore and the security guarantees that he had set out to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking the course of getting enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year is helping all its graduates get more sleep to cope with the growing culture of “nightmares” that are caffeine-fueled.
An educator has discovered that students at the number one university in the world are often confused about the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
This course was developed by Charles Szilar, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, which he believes is the first in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture about the impact that lack of sleep had on education.
‘At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I told this all this time, my senior year?’
"Nobody ever told him about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he said.
This course, launched for the first time this year, explains how good sleep habits help students achieve academic and athletic performance, as well as what they need to improve their general well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's Department of Health Services, said the university had made the decision to launch the course this week after students were severely deprived of sleep.
The one-hour-long course has some subsequent related tasks.
One section contains images of a dormitory room, where students will learn about the effects of caffeine and light by clicking on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books, and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and realize the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants were asked how long-term sleep deprivation could increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons, then encouraging participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of the students immediately.
"But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know if you decide to smoke a cigarette but also have a right to know its effects on health."
The culture of "staying awake all night" pride still exists, he said, adding that sleep deprivation is a growing problem due to modern technology and increasing pressure on students.
Ensuring you get enough good quality sleep should be a student's 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said - even the lack of sleep makes the brain starve, making them constantly hungry."
Raymond Soe, 19, studying chemical and physical biology in California, helped Professor Szilar design the course, also taking a class during his first year at Harvard last year.
She said the course opened her eyes and inspired her to pursue a campus-wide course.
In the next step, he hopes that all post-graduate students will be requested to complete such a study program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Szilar recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed as well as when to wake up, and should be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which may destroy your circadian rhythm, resulting in problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The defeat of the masters of Manga's Golgo Gerard.
The Rangers lost another away game to Steven Gerrard's random team of Dolly Menger's goal after losing 1-0 to Livingston.
Ibrox's team was looking forward to another win after a 4–1 win in St. Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerard's second defeat as manager in 18 matches, which took him eight points away from Leedsbrook's Premiership top-ranked Harts.
Menga was injured seven minutes before half-time but the battered Rangers line-up never hit them.
Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston has risen to third place and trails Hibernian in goal difference.
And rangers may have more problems because Linsman Callum Spence had to be treated for a head injury for an object thrown from an avenue edge.
Gerard has made eight changes to the team that have lifted Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livvy 11 that took a point from the Hearts last week and should have been proud of the way his well-armed team smothered the opponent.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball possession, but Livingston did more with his ball.
Menger should have scored in just two minutes if he had sent Scott Pitman to the first-ever take-off by Alan McGregor, but the midfielder squandered his big opportunity.
Keghan got Craig Halket, a tall free-kick captain of the Jacobs, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to hit the ball in the back post.
The Rangers regained control, but there was more hope than belief in their play in the final third.
Alfredo Morlos must have felt that he should have been awarded a penalty in the quarter-hour due to the clash between him and Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's application.
Rangers could only target two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely bothered by Lasana Kulili's head and OV Azaria's shot.
Levy's 34th-minute opening goal may have been against the flow of the game, but no one can deny that they alone are entitled to their own design.
Again, the Rangers failed to handle Jacobs' deep set-piece.
Scott Arfield didn't react as Deccan Gallagher slotted Scott Robinson's ball, he kept his head cool to pick Menga for a simple finish.
Gerard took action at the break to replace Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the change was almost immediately going to be useful as the winger was in Morales, but the extraordinary Kelly moved him from line to block.
But as Livingston visitors began to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, Lithgow and Halket were sending long balls after a long ball.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the final stages, but McGregor was determined to thwart Jacobs' attempts before he was able to head from Lithgow Corner.
As Jacobs stumbled on, Thomson once again turned his back on Glen Middleton, the Rangers' subsidiary, who demanded a late penalty.
Almanac: The inventor of the guitar counter.
And now our "Sunday Morning" is a page from Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Guyger was born in Germany.
Guyger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually became known as the Guyger Counter.
Since then, one of the cornerstones of science, the Guyger Counter has also become the cornerstone of a pop culture, in the 1950 film "Balls of Coronado," starring seemingly promising cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "It is used to detect radioactive minerals such as a gaigar counter, uranium.
When you give these earphones to the bride, you can hear the effects of the atoms given by radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "Does it make a lot of noise?"
"Hans" Guyger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
His invention is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect rogue cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect and kill rogue cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to detect rogue cells as part of the treatment.
The procedure involves extracting the immune cells from the patient and changing them in the lab.
They can then 'see' a protein common to many cancers and are then re-introduced.
An experimental vaccine has shown promising results with cancer patients of different levels.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to detect rogue cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the common protein of many cancers called HER2, and then re-inserting the cells.
J. Barzofsky, a professor at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "causes the growth of a wide variety of cancers, including breast, ovary, lung, and colorectal cancers," explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach has also worked to treat leukemia to "teach" patients how to eliminate immune cells and "target cancer cells."
Kanye West has been embroiled in a pro-Trump controversy after wearing a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio after a string of performances during Saturday Night Live where he praised US President Donald Trump, saying he would remain in his position in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night called Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great Cap, he denounced the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“A lot of times when I talk to a white person, they say: “How can you like Trump, he’s a racist!”
Well, if I had been concerned about racism, I would have come out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a skit starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Cavanaugh's testimony at the Senate Judicial Committee on claims of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it hasn't been broadcast, West's humorous footage has been uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It's not clear if the West is trying to make fun of the West with the post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he also had problems with backstage wear on his head.
They put me in the backseat.
He said, "Don't wear a hat."
They've pissed me off!
And then they said I'm in a sinking place," according to a Washington Examiner source.
West added: “Do you want to see the place?” Saying that he would read his own “Superman Cape, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Do you want to see the world moving forward?
Try it with love."
His comments were booed at least twice from the audience, and SNL cast members felt embarrassed, Variety reported, where one person told the publication: "There was a deafening silence throughout the studio."
West was brought in as a substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West I Love It performed a song that confused many people by decorating it like a periyar bottle.
West has received support from conservative group TPUSA head Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing up against the miscreants.”
But talkshow presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West "was what it was and he's absolutely awesome."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who is embracing and spreading the ideology that is harmful to my community."
He is independent.
And so are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he is now "officially known as Kanye West."
She is not the first artist to change her name and follow in the footsteps of DD, known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy and P Diddy.
Another contemporary rapper, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol formerly known as Prince.
A man has been charged with attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhakamor.
Assange is due to appear in federal court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacked toxic masculinity or toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his combative role as Jon Snow in HBO's Invasive Medieval Fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor, however, spoke about the stereotype of the Macho hero, saying having such a role on screen means giving young boys the idea that they have to be tough to get respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something was wrong" and questioned how to deal with the issue of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, her Game of Thrones co-star, at the age of 31, has admitted that she feels strongly about the problem.
“I personally feel quite strongly, at the moment – where are we going wrong in masculinity?” he said.
"What have we taught men as they grow up, that we are facing this problem now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its overly masculine characters.
He said: "What are we learning?
What is taught on TV and on the street that boys feel that they have to follow this particular path if they want to be men?
I think that's a really big question of this time - how do we change that?
Because obviously young people have made a big mistake.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series is renewed next summer, saying he has ended his life of "battlegrounds and horses."
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's remake of True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his robbed brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers his wife Rose as the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so it gave my future family the gift of my life."
In the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Egrit, Kitt's character played John Snow's lover.
The couple got married in June 2018 in Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has reported a 14% increase in new cases.
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 infected people in the country, health officials said.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were due to sexual transmission, a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection spread rapidly to various parts of China for blood circulation.
But the number of people infected with HIV on this route has been brought down to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still thought to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men later marry women.
Many of these infections are caused by inadequate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking GOP senators' data, 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat asserted that these claims were being propagated by "ultra-right wing" scholars and websites.
"Lies, lies, and even more hateful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released includes the home address and phone numbers of United States senators. Senators. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both of Utter.
An unidentified man posted on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavana.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Scholar and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the post's source was linked to the "Waters" office and revealed information about which members of the Waters staff, Hill reported.
"These baseless allegations are completely false and a blatant lie," Waters continued.
"Members of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these frauds and false allegations - were in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless allegation is completely false and a blatant lie."
Waters' statement quickly received online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is infuriating," wrote Fleischer.
"It shows that he has no inclination to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they don't get angry.
They will not be disputed.
They must not question the intention of the complainant.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer was comparing Waters' response to the criticism of the Democrats about Judge Cavanaugh, who he was considered too angry by critics during Thursday's hearing.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is seeking to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's really big," he said.
In his statement, Waters said his office had "warned the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent claims."
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed,” he continued, “and that they will be legally held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any member of my staff and all members of my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again Review – Weak Rowan Atkinson Spying
It is now traditional to see the significance of Brexit in any new film, including the British diagonal, and this seems to apply to the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which started with Johnny English in 2003 and returned to Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Is there any way we can make sure that we're going to be able to export the same amount of waste?
At any rate, pop-eyed, rubber-faced disabled Johnny English has a license to create new things for the second time - more than anything else his name indicates that he is a broad comic creation designed for the cinema world in a language other than English.
He's certainly the dumbest secret agent who's a bit tied in despite the flamboyant trend of smooth splendor, a dash of Mr. Bean and a dollop of chaps contributed a note to the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony in London, the Chariots of Fire theme tune.
He was originally based on Traveler and starred in international mystery man Atkinson's once-forgotten Barclays TV commercials, sparking chaos.
There are one or two great moments in this last JEE outing.
I'd love to see Johnny English approaching a helicopter while the rotor blades are hanging with a little helmet, dressed in medieval armor.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy seems obvious, but the joke has been quite subversive and strangely overstated, especially with "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offering the joke as an element of self-confidence.
The joke seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me, the awkward accidents of Johnny English are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's silent-cinema jokes in Bean's personality.
Over the years, Great Britain has been in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated Britain's most secretive web network of espionage, revealing the identities of all Britain's agents in the field, to frustrate the agent responsible - sadly a small role for Kevin Aldon.
This is the last confidence of a prime minister who is already suffering a complete collapse of the political opposition, he is a dull and bound personality: Emma Thompson has done her best with this semi-theresa-me character but there is not much to work on in the script.
His intelligence advisors told him that every active spy had been compromised, so he had to get someone out of retirement.
And that means collapsing Johnny English, who is now employed as a school teacher in some posh institutions, but teaches out-of-the-record about how to be a camouflage worker: there are some good jokes here, since English offers a rock-type academy school of detectives here.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and again reunited with his former long-suffering sidekick Bau, starring Ben Miller.
Bowe is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, the role of a jolly-hockey-stick in which Vicky Pepperdine has been somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who made a fatal mistake in the Her Majesty's Secret Service, returned to action and faced Olga Kurelenko's insurance lady Ophelia Boulitova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling dangerously short of the magic of a billionaire with caricatures, who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinful Jason Volta, starring Jack Lacy.
English and Bau begin to sound their far-reaching high-jinks: in the guise of a waiter, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they start a fight by smuggling themselves into Volta’s luxury boat; and try to familiarize themselves with the interior of the English Volta’s home by using a virtual reality headset to create pure adventure.
All the stops are certainly drawn for the last order, but as elusive and exhilarating as it is, the whole thing has quite a bit of kid TV feel to it.
Very middle-aged staff.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t have imagined it: the British film industry couldn’t give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
Labour denies it's making plans for Britons to work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a core plan that will see Britons work four days a week - but get paid for five days.
The team wants the company's owners to share the money they've saved with employees with an extra day off through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.
This will allow employees to enjoy a three-day holiday - but still take home the same salary.
According to sources, the idea will be "fit" with the party's economic program and there are plans to move the country on behalf of the workers.
The Trades Union Congress has approved the relocation of workers to a four-day week as a way to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight but a four-day working day is an aspiration that adapts to the party’s approach to balancing the economy in favour of workers as well as the overall industrialisation of the party.”
Not the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working day during their 2017 general election campaign.
The ambition is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole, however.
A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘A four-day working day is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.’
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to express his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to return power to utility companies from "unrecognised directors" and "beneficiaries."
The shadow chancellor's plan means that current shareholders of water companies may not get their entire share back as the Labour government may give up some due to perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to hire staff on the company board and create an inclusive ownership fund to justify 10 percent of employees in private-sector companies, whose annual dividend stands at $500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether Kavanaugh's FBI investigation could change their minds
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and the Bureau's findings have raised questions about whether a Republican senator could turn their support around.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators if the FBI could discover something that led them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I asked to go to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, the accusation came out, I said, 'Did you do this?'
He was determined, unambiguous."
Graham's vote, of course, appears to be irreversible.
“My mind has been made up about Brett Kavanaugh and a big pretty important complaint will need to be made to change that,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know it: Brett strongly denies it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And those whose names he said could not be verified."
It is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be the Global Citizen Festival in New York, an annual music event that stars a great line-up of performances and an equally impressive mission; an end to world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shaun Mendes not only to celebrate, but to raise awareness of the event's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, described in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group aiming to alleviate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it internationally.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (if you are not willing to pay for VIP tickets), concertgoers had to work in multiple jobs or "activities" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful has the global citizenry been in achieving its goal for 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people through a free concert a real move to persuade people to take action, or another case of so-called "cliquetism" - where people feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, moving towards achieving various goals.
It says the measures have helped world leaders announce more than $37 billion in commitments and policies that will affect the lives of 2.22 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the team cited 390 commitments and announcements that have started from its operations, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or funded.
The group estimates that the protected fund has so far had a direct impact on about 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments are the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers "to help children grow to their full potential," with a commitment to provide Rwanda with $35 million to end malnutrition problems in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a landmark in history," Tracey Ullman, the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a power concert in London in April 2018.
The team also said that after more than 5,000 steps were taken in the United States to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children in nutritional interventions.
One of the most frequently asked questions asked on its website is “What do you think we can do to end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, just like the great civil rights and anti-racism movement before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shaun Mendes, Cardi B, Gene Moni are among those who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be performed by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy to "block" Russia's energy exports
Washington may "necessarily" seek refuge in its navy to prevent Russian fuels from coming into Middle East countries, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Jink alleges that Russia's annexation of Syria - significantly, where it is acting at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to visit the new energy market.
"I believe that the reason they are located in the Middle East is because they want to broker power in Eastern Europe, like the southern center of Europe," he said.
And according to officials, there are ways and means to take action against it.
"With our navy, the United States has the ability to keep sea routes free and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their fuel does not go to the market," he said.
Zinc was speaking to participants at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that identifies the U.S. as the "voice of energy consumers."
He compared the use of Washington to Russia and Iran in real terms.
"Referring to Russia as a "retained card" with a fossil-fuel-based economy, he said "the financial options of Iran and Russia are related to receiving and replacing benefits from less energy."
The statement came as the Trump administration sought to boost the export of cheaply liquefied natural gas to Europe instead of Russia.
Under the influence of this, US President Donald Trump himself is trying to get Germany out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, according to Trump, it is held in the hands of Berlin Moscow."
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the USD 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline, is ready to take it to 110 billion cubic meters - a fully financially-saving project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is nothing more than financial, and that it is an example of unequal competition.
"In my belief, we agree that energy cannot be used as a pressing tool and consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after an interview with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has resulted in a negative response from Germany, with Germany reaffirming its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), Germany's leading industry body, has asked the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"After a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) Dieter Kampf said, 'We have a big problem with the interference of a third country in our energy supply.
Elizabeth Warren will "look out" for 2020 presidential candidacy, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "cut off" her candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections.
In a town hall in Holleyock, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was in competition.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes women in top positions," she said.
"After November 6, I will be strongly opposed to the presidency."
During his speech at Warren Town Hall, President Donald Trump said Trump was "leading the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has faced criticism from Trump and Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
"Of course we need an FBI investigation before we can vote," Warren said in a tweet on Friday.
A study published on Thursday found that a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe he should run for president in 2020.
The political research center at Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll found that 85 percent of Massachusetts "potential" voters said they should not contest the senator's vote.
Twenty-three percent supported the fight.
The survey found that former governor Deval Patrick's support for the fight was higher, with 38% supporting a possible fight and 48% not.
Other high-profile Democratic names likely to be discussed in the 2020 race include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has said that he will make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Paulin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
26-year-old Trac Palin spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"I can understand other families who have PTSD and the consequences of what our soldiers are going through," he said at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the house" and told his son and other war veterans that "they came back a little changed, they came back hard, they came back wondering if they had any respect for their colleagues in the military and in the air force and other members of the military who gave the country what they had."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and according to Dan Bennett, a police department spokesman, he was accused of domestic violence, carrying weapons and drugging a woman.
18 states, DC supports the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are backing legal challenges to the new U.S. policy that refuses to shelter victims of gang or family violence.
In a bid to support a asylum seeker who challenged the policy, representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court brief in court in Washington on Friday, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been released.
He said his accomplices "and his violent gang member boys" had abused him, but U.S. officials refused his asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys for states supporting Grace cite the example of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence, from which a large number of applicants for asylum come to the United States.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeal Board that allowed undocumented immigrants who fled domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Ressin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "has ignored state, federal and international law for decades."
The Friend-of-the-Court Brief states that “the application of all refugees under this federal law must be judged according to certain facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates the original purpose.”
In the statement, attorneys also argued that the policy denying immigrants entry is hurting the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and that they “provide essential labor.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Refugees who have had to leave their own country due to persecution or fear for membership or political opinion in a race, religion, nationality or certain social group can be sheltered," Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Shelter is never meant to be the solution to all the problems - even all the deadly problems - that people face every day around the world.
The death toll has doubled in the rescue efforts.
The situation was terrible for the survivors.
"Ressa Kusuma, 35, at a shelter in Palu city, asked her to comfort her fever-stricken child, saying, "It was very worrying."
"An ambulance is arriving every minute.
We don't have clean water."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes in an attempt to find what they found in the water.
Hundreds of people were injured and 7.5 magnitude tremors were felt in the affected hospitals.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, whose back and shoulder bones were broken, have been kept out of the Palu Army Hospital, undergoing treatment under the skies due to the subsequent tremors.
He cried to talk about the feeling of a terrible earthquake when he was in a five-storey hotel room with his wife and daughter.
"I didn't have time to save them.
I was stuck in the middle of a broken wall, I think," Harris told reporters, adding that they had come to the city for a wedding ceremony.
"I heard my wife's scream for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to him or his family.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. envoy accuses China of "misusing" the country through "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily citing the mutual benefit of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused the American press of using propaganda against Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited a paid supplement to the Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest Chinese daily, and accused China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional election, a charge China denies.
Trump accused Beijing of trying to meddle in the US election, which U.S. officials said was a new attempt by Washington to pressure China.
It is natural that foreign governments would advertise to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are currently waging a trade war that has led to them increasing tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to harm exporters in states such as Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad said in an article in Sunday's Des Mines Register that China "has now doubled that barbarism with purposeful advertising in our own free press."
"The Chinese government is taking unethical advantage of the unbridled history of America's freedom of speech and the cherished freedom of the press in this propaganda campaign through paid advertising on the Des Mines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in the newsstands along the streets of Beijing, you will find limited opposition voices and you will not see the true reflection of the Chinese people's differences about China's worrying economic path, because the media here runs at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that his writing "has refused to print a major newspaper in China", although he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans are trying to keep female voters away before the midterms in the Kavanaugh debate, analysts warn
In the face of multiple allegations of sexual harassment by several leading Republicans, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has stood by and covered up, with analysts warning that they will see an adverse reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment around the issue has grown wildly, and it appears that most Republicans are already seeking to move ahead with the vote in public.
In an article published on Saturday, Grant Rieher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill, "They can't come back at all."
Rihar said there was doubt whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s pressure for an FBI investigation would calm angry voters at the last minute.
“Women should not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget tomorrow and even November,” said Karen Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser to the progressive MoveOn group and national women’s spokesman, according to the Washington DC newspaper.
Despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a demonstration on the Senate hallway on Friday morning as Republicans decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination. Mike reported.
"There will be a past of democratic enthusiasm and inspiration," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
"People say there's too much already; it's true.
But it could be even more so, especially among the ominous female voters in the suburbs and among young voters aged 18 to 29, who often do not vote because they do not like the president.”
Even before Ford publicly testified about allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that there could be adverse repercussions if Republicans proceed with the endorsement.
"It's been a complicated issue for the GOP," Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just a committee vote or a final vote or whether Kafanf will be left behind, it's also about how Republicans took the issue and used it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA Group, which supports Democrats in the vote, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be a bit hesitant about who to trust in the wake of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, with the latter being heavily opinionated.
A new survey by YouGov found that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford's testimony definitively or likelyly, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh.
It was also found that 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or must have lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After being pressured by Fleck, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reports the Guardian.
Ford testified before the Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh molested him at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleges that Supreme Court Justice Nomini showed him her genitals at a party while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventors of the World Wide Web are planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
This technology is the latest project in the legend, Inrapt, a company that will build the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solid gives users the right to choose where their data will be stored and what information people will be allowed to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the real purpose of Inrap was "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
This app allows everyone to create a P&D or "personal online data store" using Solid's technology.
This can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like getting Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all in the same browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data stores is that it completely depends on the user - which type of information can be accessed.
The company has called it "personal empowerment through data."
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrap will help bring wealth, process, and appropriate skills to everyone's solids.
The company currently consists of a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, a team of some contracted on-staff developers and volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the existing tools on InRapt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are "not talking about whether to launch a full change with Facebook and Google where all their business models will be changed completely overnight."
"We don't ask permission from them."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrap's "aim is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has emerged as a strong voice in the net neutrality debate.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the future of the web," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Van: Victoria Cross Clarique Celebration of the First World War
The city celebrates its centennial as the only church in England to have won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend Bernard Van won the award on September 29, 1918, during the invasions of Belanglis and Lehancott.
However, he was killed four days later by an assassin and he never knew that he had received the highest British military honor.
His two grandsons unveiled his memorial at a parade in Rusden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "extraordinary" that the monument would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's death.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van "led his battalion through dense fog and heavy shelling of field and machine guns" during the de Saint-Quentin Canal Perona.
He then rushed to the firing line and led the line with "maximum courage", with just one field song, and knocked out three enemies.
On October 4, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German assassin - just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather’s works were “something I could never have done and which is a great honor.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vane, presented the wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he was "extremely honored to participate in the parade" and added that "a true hero's heroism is being displayed in support of a lot of people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the 206 Bellotto, but instead they got the Pepa Pig.
Imagine that you woke up all night to see a great belter 206 and the main event was not shown.
The original card from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six, and was shown live on Channel 5 in the UK.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Moussaoui and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the coverage changed to Pepa Piaget and shocked the UK audience.
They were up early in the morning for this fight, so some people were angry.
A fan on Twitter described the children's cartoon swapping as "some kind of dirty joke."
"They were forced to change the children's cartoons because it was not appropriate to show such shows at 6 a.m. in accordance with government rules," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellatto, in response to a question about the broadcast.
"Papa the Pig," "Yes"
Scott Cocker, president of Bellatto's company, said he would work on a timetable for future visitors to the UK.
"Maybe we'll be able to solve it during the replay," Cooker said.
"But now it's six in the morning on Sunday and ours on Sunday, they can't do it until Monday."
But we are working on it.
Trust me, when it was switched on a lot of messages came in successively and they weren't very friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it might be a technical error.
No, it was a government thing.
I promise that won't happen next time.
We're going to cut it down to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - in an attempt to give fans more.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Dessert Island Disc: Tom Daley suffers from "humiliation" due to sex.
Olympic diver Tom Daley said that while growing up, he suffered from low self-esteem because of sex - but it inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand "not everyone is like me" until he went to secondary school.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disc presented by Lauren Laverne, she stated that she spoke about gay rights in giving others "hope."
He also said that after the birth of the child, his thinking about winning the Olympics has decreased.
Christie Young, the regular host of the long-running show, has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a disgruntled on LaVarne's first show, Daly said he felt "smaller" than everyone else, because "the choice of boys and girls was not socially acceptable."
He said: "To this day, it remains real to feel that small and separate that gave me the strength and determination to succeed."
He said that he wanted to prove himself as "something" so that everyone would know about his sexuality so that they would not be disappointed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and has used her presence to appeal to more countries to recognize homosexuality at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia.
She said she opened her mouth, because she considers herself lucky to live openly without complications and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion talked about falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "surprised me."
Daly married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him. He said the age gap was not a problem.
"When you face so much at such a young age" - he first went to the Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who has seen so much downhill in his life.
The couple gave birth to a son, Robert Ray Black-Daly, in June, and Daly said his "whole outlook" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would say 'I want to win a gold medal'.
"There's a lot more to the Olympics than winning a gold medal.
"Rose is my hero."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daly said his father never admitted that he was going to die and he finally asked if their ticket to London 2012 was confirmed - because he wanted to stay in the first row.
“I never even said that ‘you won’t be sitting in the first row anymore,’” he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and he breathed his last and died and I didn't admit that he was undefeated," he said.
The following year, Daly competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"It's been my dream all my life - to dive into the Olympics in front of my audience, there's no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired her choice of her first song - Heather Small's Pride - which resonated with her in preparation for the Olympics and which still resonates with her.
Dessert Island on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Michael Jackson will sit on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to return to his form if he doesn't want to make it an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who has played in this biennial event a record 12 times, has had to sit on the bench on Saturday's Foreball and Foursome instead of Captain Jim Furyk.
Instead of being at the center of the hustle, which he used to play in the United States, the five-time major winner has spent the day working on cheerleaders and getting his game back on the range.
Not always comfortable among drivers, even at the top of their careers, this 48-year-old tight Le Golf is not suitable for the national course, where the long rough often gets in the way of a long shot.
And if the course itself isn't bad enough, Mickelson, in the No. 9, is facing British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with Rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points down at the start of 12 singles matches, can get off to a good start, the match of Mickelson could prove crucial.
Fitzgerald had confidence in him, but he didn't have much to say.
"He's fully aware of his role today, placing his hand on my shoulder and saying he's ready for tomorrow," Furick said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's been a big part of the team over the last year and a big part of the team this year.
I don't think he's going to play two games.
I was hoping for more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought of going forward.
He wants to get on the field, like everybody else."
In Sunday's match, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches.
It could end up in a Ryder Cup career that doesn't even go through his personal records.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven half-centuries to his name, although Furyk says his presence gives the team a boost.
"He's a funny guy, he's smart, he likes to annoy people, he likes to be in the team room and he's a great guy," he said.
"I think the new players enjoyed playing with him a lot, this week as well, which is great to see.
He gives so much more than just a game."
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big lead may also disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that even if the rider goes down to the singles on the last day of the Ryder Cup with a major lead, an uncomfortable situation can arise.
Dane made his debut in 1997 in a match held in Valdarama, where the Savi Ballesteros-led side gained five points to the Americans, but only won 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 in the narrowest margin.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only by a nominal margin," said Bosner, appearing in the picture, on Friday and yesterday, two days before Le Golf National won 5-3 in its 2018 class at 10-6 lead.
"History will show me and the team that it's not over yet.
Get ready for tomorrow with great enthusiasm.
Get on the field and do the right thing.
It doesn't end until the point is reached.
We have one goal, that is to try and win the trophy, and that will be the eyes of our bird.
I've always said that I look at 12 players in my team, but I'm also very aware of who we are on the other side - the best player in the world."
Bjorn added: "I'm pleased with the way our players have done in the tough golf course. "I'll never be over-confident about that.
Tomorrow is a different battle.
Tomorrow is a new day, and it will be different.
When all goes well, it’s great to be with a partner, but when you’re alone on the field, your abilities as a golfer are thoroughly tested.
This message needs to reach all the players, who will give their best tomorrow.
Now, you have to leave your partner and move on and make the best of it."
In contrast to Bjorn, rival Jim Furyk will have his eye on what the players have played as a team to play better personally, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have picked up three points out of four.
In the "Miracle of the Day" in Europe and as part of the team that won in Brooklyn, Furick himself experienced dramatic changes on the last day.
Asked about how captain Ben Crenshaw had inspired his players before he landed on the last day in 1999, he said, "I remember every word."
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to get rid of the fast starters like Brooklyn and Medina.
When the game swings to one side, there is a lot of pressure in the middle-side matches.
We're going to create a line-up and we're going to put the boys down the way we thought, we're going to do some magic tomorrow."
Top order Europeans with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter have been tasked with leading the resistance against Thomas, who will face Rory McLaroy in the opening match.
"I have arranged this team in this order, because I think it will cover everything," Bojorn said of the selection of his singles.
Germany's new warship to be re-launched
According to local media reports, the T was supposed to be launched in 2014 with the newest team from the German Navy to replace the previous Cold War-era warships, but due to faulty systems and snowballing costs, it will not happen until at least next year.
The launch of the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigate's first ship "Rhineland-Falz" has been postponed until the first half of 2019, the military spokesman was quoted as saying by the Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project has been hampered by post-delivery problems.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is reported that they will have powerful cannons, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signaling.
Other important features include long maintenance periods - it will be possible to deploy new frigates for a maximum of two years away from the country's ports.
However, the continued delay means that the state-of-the-art warships - which are supposed to help Germany demonstrate power abroad - will become outdated by the time they land in the water, Die Zeit reported.
The ill-fated F-125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy refused to launch the official Vosges ship and sent it back to Hamburg's Bloom and Voss shipyard.
This is the first time a ship has been sent back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cites several important "software and hardware errors" that would render the ship useless in war.
The software's hulls are particularly important, as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - half the manpower of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was over-heavy which would reduce its performance and hamper the Navy's path to adding future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Fulz" is thought to be twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
From the initial level of <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion, it has reached a staggering <0xC2><0xA3>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The new frigates have become even more important in the wake of Germany's recent warning of a naval power shrinkage.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bertels, head of the German Parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was "running out of the appropriate ship for deployment."
The official said the problem has been huge over time, as no replacement ships of the old ones that were scrapped were brought in.
He regretted that no Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships were able to join the navy.
Listen to The Secret Life of Pets
A new study is being conducted on an estate in the Scottish mountains to find out how bats use landforms in search of food.
The findings are expected to shed new light on the behavior of this unique flying mammal and help with conservation activities in the future.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will continue to research common and soprano pipers and Dobenton bats at the Inverau Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important places around the area to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct ongoing surveys using portable detectors.
The expert will analyze the sound of all recordings and determine the frequency of the bat post and take a look at what the species is doing.
A landscape map and report will then be created to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behavior.
NTS's Nature Conservation Consultant Rob hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and how forests can be protected for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the last century.
They are in danger for building and developmental work that harms their sleeping place and habitat.
Wind-based turbines and lighting can also pose hazards, such as from some chemicals in flypapers and building materials, as well as attacks on pets.
The mouse is not blind.
However, their ears are more effective than their eyes when it comes to hunting due to night hunting habits.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to identify hazards and obstacles along the flight path.
The NTS, whose responsibility is to maintain more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, has given importance to bats.
They have ten trained specialists who conduct regular surveys, visit sleeping areas and sometimes carry out rescue operations.
The company also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat conservation site on the Three Estates of Damfries and Gallo, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the property manager, said: "This is an ideal place for bats.
"It's a good area for three-wheelers," he said.
"There are old buildings, there are many old trees, and there are all good dwellings.
But much more about bats is still unknown, so the work we do here and in other places will help us understand more about what they need to survive.”
He stressed the importance of knowing the presence of bats before maintaining the property, as it could inexplicably destroy 400 female and child bats due to the destruction of a maternal home, and wipe out the entire local bat population.
Bats are protected animals and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know much about how many species live.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape and lawyers are going to bring a lawsuit against the German newspaper
Describing the rape allegations against him as "fake news", she said that people "want to increase their acquaintance with his name."
His lawyers are set to file a lawsuit against German news magazine Der Spiegel, who made the allegation public.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mazurga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is accused of giving her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, according to Der Spiegel's report on Friday.
Hours after the claim came to light, 33-year-old Ronaldo, speaking to his 142 million followers on his Instagram live video, described the report as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no.
"What they said today is false news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
"They want to use my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous, but it's part of life.
I'm a happy guy and everything is going well," the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an inadmissible report to be taken as suspicious of privacy."
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the player must seek compensation "for moral damages of importance to the offense, which is probably one of the gravest violations of personal rights in recent times".
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the player's house after meeting at a nightclub where he sexually assaulted her.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo pleaded guilty and told her that he was "99 percent" frustrated for "good people," "one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to the police and was photographed in the hospital, but she later agreed to settle out of court, as she was "horrified by the fear of retribution" and feared being "humiliated in public."
The 34-year-old said she now wants to raise the settlement again, as she is mentally disturbed by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was in the middle of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the crime and joined Italian club Juve on a $100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret forever’ losing its position as car maker
Commerce Minister Greg Clark said the UK would "forever regret" losing its position as the world's first car maker after Brexit.
He added that it was "worrying" that UK Toyota told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnston near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker has said that if a no-deal Brexit happens, people may lose their jobs due to border delays.
Bernstein's factory - which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which about 90 percent are exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I’m of the opinion that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory could stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s managing director at Bernstein.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concern about leaving the European Union without an agreement on how to conduct cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has said it will close its mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns that car manufacturers are talking about is the risk of supply chains in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with shipments coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for ordered cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border that could lead to a delay in supplies and a crisis in the bloc, according to trade circles.
The company has said that it is not possible to keep an inventory of more than one day's worth at the Toyota Derbyshire plant, due to which production can be stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's checkers plan for future EU relations was "prepared to avoid such checks at the border."
“We need a deal. We want to make the best deal that will not only sustain success, but also make it possible to enjoy the potential for future improvement,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today show.
“Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers are proving that it is very important to continue the successful arrangement of the supply chain.”
Toyota is unable to say how long production will be stopped, but they have warned that in the long run the additional cost will reduce the factory's competitiveness and could result in many jobs being lost.
Peter Suvalris, who has worked at Burnston for 24 years and is the plant's Unite Union convener, said his members were increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these things are gone, they don't come back.
A government spokesman said: "We need to have a definite and credible plan for our future relationship with the E.U."
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed.
Amid tensions over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday that a high-level meeting with Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week."
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, the connection between Trump's associates and Russia, and possible obstructions to the president's trial.
In recent months, Washington has been debating whether or not to fire Trump's deputy attorney general and question Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of using a secret mic to record conversations with Trump and removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he was reported to have gone to the White House on Monday in the wake of reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, while Trump was in the UN office in New York.
Trump said he would “not like” Rosestein being fired, but that Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified, that the meeting was postponed to avoid a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, for which the full Senate vote has been further delayed.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Regarding the meeting with Rosestein, he said: "There is no date set, it could be this week, it could be one week later for all other matters on the Supreme Court."
"I'm always looking for information"
Some journalists will oppose the statement, as Sanders has not held any more press briefings at the White House since September 10.
Chrissy Teigen asked the reason.
Sanders said the reason for not holding a briefing was not to "show people" to journalists, although he said: "I don't deny that they did the thing that people showed."
He then suggested increasing direct communication between Trump and the press.
"The current president holds more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president," he said without citing any evidence: "We've judged that number."
"But if the media gets a chance to question the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me," Sanders said.
We try very hard to do that, and over the last few weeks, you've seen us do that, and instead of a press briefing, it's going to take place by talking directly to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly takes questions when he leaves the White House or attends opening sessions or a press conference with prominent guests.
There was very little press conference.
In New York this week, the president probably showed why he was doing unplanned work and sometimes had a bizarre appearance in front of a group of journalists.
Health Minister NHS Scotland writes a letter to EU workers over Brexit fears
The health minister thanked the country's EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland and expressed their desire to remain in the post-Brexit period.
Jean Freeman sent a letter to MSP less than six months before leaving the UK.
The Scottish government has already promised to pay the settled status application costs for EU citizens to work in the country's government services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: Negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit continue throughout the summer, which is expected to have consequences this fall.
However, the UK government is also preparing for a possible no-deal situation.
I know you are all going through a difficult time.
That is why I would like to remind you again how valuable each member of staff is to me regardless of their nationality.
From all over the European Union and beyond, colleagues have brought valuable experience and expertise that has strengthened and improved health care and benefited patients and our community.
Scotland is your own country and we want you to stay here."
Christie's surgery after a head injury
Tennessee's Mike Organ said Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Ackerman underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and somehow became unconscious," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave the oxygen to this patient on the sideline and he was brought back for further tests.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that this time around, Vanderbilt was out of surgery at the medical center.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/type of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
The second-year student, wearing a red shirt, is playing his first season with Ibarakrambi, Tennessee State, after being transferred from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before coming out of the game, with a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK.
Under the Tory plan, when foreign buyers buy new property in the UK, they will have to pay higher stamp duty and the extra money will be spent on helping the homeless.
The move will mitigate the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury hopes to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay more stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK - and the extra money will be spent on helping the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move will mitigate the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract younger voters, with more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The stamp duty increase will apply to individuals and organizations that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional money will be used by the government to help the homeless.
Surcharge - which, in addition to the current stamp duty, was levied at a higher rate than the second house and rental house two years ago - could be more than three per cent.
The Treasury hopes to increase revenue by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of London's newly created total assets are bought by residents outside the UK, for which prices have risen and the situation has made it even more difficult for first-time home buyers.
Most of the country's elite areas - especially the capital - are becoming "unrecognised cities" in the crowd of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help the younger generation buy their first home.
She accused large construction companies of increasing property prices by not buying land and using it, and called on Mrs. Make to abolish the quota for affordable housing to solve Britain's "responsibility problem."
Mr Corbyn announced an interesting series of proposals for housing reform, including rent control and an end to "no-fault" evictions.
He wants to give the council more power to build new homes.
"Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to the restoration of the British dream - which is that life should be better for everyone in the new generation," she said.
This means that there is a market for broken homes.
"Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and make a life here."
However, it may also not be right that foreign and foreign private companies that do not live in the UK will buy property as easily as hard-working British residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a house is far from reality, and the problem of homelessness remains very real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate dream is to take charge of Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross has said that his "final ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland someday in the future.
This 42-year-old Scotland resident is currently enjoying the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, who are now third in League One, three points behind the first team.
St. Mary's returned to the Scottish Premiership last season and moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's it so far," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsground.
"But I grew up watching Scotland's game at Hampden with my father as a child and it always pulls me back.
This opportunity can only come if I succeed in running the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kane, Gus Poyet and Paulo de Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he did not feel disappointed by the rejection of offers from big clubs such as Burnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The measure of success for me at the moment will be 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
It is undoubtedly worthy of the Premier League because of the structure and facilities at this club," he said.
"It's not that easy to get there, but I'll probably see myself as a success if I can get the club back there."
Ross' manager life is currently only three years old after having 15 months as assistant boss and Harts' coaching staff at Dumbarton.
He then helped Alaya recover from the downhill to the third level and convert Saint Mirren from the downhill to the championship title winner in the next season.
And Ross says he's more comfortable here now than it was in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton's academic playing career.
"It was probably a real milestone," he recalled taking over from Alaa.
"I really believed that management was better for me than sports.
It sounds strange because I did the right thing, lived a rough life from it and enjoyed some success.
But the game is hard.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel the same way about work pressure, but the management seems to be right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, it's the most comforting thing on my own skin in my entire adult life."

According to the study, 5.30 pm on Saturday is the ideal time for pints.
Summer heatwaves have increased congestion on Britain's smoky pubs, but have put pressure on the restaurant chain.
Sales of pubs and bars rose 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant money collection fell 4.8 percent, according to figures published.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultant company, who compiled the figures, said: "Continuous sunshine and England's unexpected long-term participation in the World Cup will mean that the same trend will continue in July as in the previous month, when sales of pubs increased by 2.8 percent and restaurant sales declined.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant business in June was even worse in July.
The drinks major pubs and bars have done very well so far, and restaurant sales have been as bad as ever.
The main food pubs are also suffering from the heat, but did not sell them down like restaurants.
It's like people are just going out for a drink.
Sales of drinks in all pubs and bars rose 6.6 percent this month, with food sales falling three percent.”
Paul Newman of RSM, a retirement and hospitality analyst, said: “The trend towards the end of April is still continuing.
Weather and major social or sporting events have the greatest impact when it comes to selling on the outdoor market.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups will be in a difficult situation, but this 4.8 percent drop on sales per year will be particularly painful.
Time will tell whether the long and hot summers for food major operators can come at a bad time, and whether the soft weather in August will bring some relief.”
In July, the total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including the new opening, was 2.7 percent, reflecting a decline in sales in brand roll-outs.
Coffer Pitch Tracker Industry Sales Monitor from the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collected and analyzed performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 million, and established industry standards.
One in five children have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The study revealed that one in five children - some 11-year-olds - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the "fake Insta" page
There have been reports that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students say they have a "major" account to show their parents.
One in five children - some just 11 years old - is creating a social media account hiding from adults.
Among the 20,000 secondary school students surveyed "fake insta" - picture-sharing site Instagram is relevant, with the account showing a trend of rapid growth.
There have been reports that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty-two percent of students said they had a transparent "head" account to show their parents, along with a hidden one.
A mother, who saw her 13-year-old daughter's hidden site, saw a teenager calling on others to "rape me."
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistress Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, half of whom admit to having a secret account.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create places online that parents and teachers can’t find.”
Elidha Doyle to be named on Scottish Athletics Board's 'Voice for Athletes'
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Elidh Doyle has been elected a member of the Scottish Athletics Board as an executive director.
Doyle Scotland's most successful track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for sports managers to benefit from his extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Elidh has a great reputation across the Scottish, UK and global athletics community and we are sure she will benefit greatly from being brought on the Scottish athletics board," Bty said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be working as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really help support Scotland’s sport and take it forward.”

The Internet Is Differing From Mothers And Cows In Breast Pump Advertising
A breast pump company has split the internet's opinion with an ad that compares baby's mothers to cow's milk.
To mark the launch of what has been called the "world's first noiseless breast pump," consumer technology company LV has released a fun music video ad that showcases the freedom that modern mothers enjoy.
Four real mothers are dancing to a song with a straw-filled cow running, the lyrics of which include: "Yes, I do milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If no one sees, it's not an animal bat, it's my breast."
The chorus continues: "Pump it, pump it, pump it, feed the kids, pump it, milk my girlfriends."
However, the ad, which was released on the company's Facebook page, created controversy online.
The video, with 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, received mixed reactions from viewers. Many have said it sheds light on the "fear" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cattle in advertising of this product is a very bad decision.
They, like us, need to get pregnant and give birth to babies in order to produce milk, the difference being that their babies are stolen from them within a few days of birth," one wrote.

Another commented: "This is obviously disappointing for both the mother and the child.
But why shouldn't they be used for breast pump advertising for mothers who bring their babies?"
Another said: "Very uncomfortable advertising."
Others have stood by the ad, with one woman admitting that she liked the song "pleasant."
"I think that's a great idea.
If I had a baby, I'd have a baby.
I feel like a cow when I'm pumping.
It's a little crazy, but I'm doing it well.
"It's an innovative product," he said.
Another commented: "This is a hilarious ad aimed at mothers who pump (often in their workplaces or toilets) and think of themselves as "cows."
This ad does not praise or criticize the dairy industry at all."
At the end of the video, a group of women tell that they all danced with the pump hidden in their bra.
The ad is based on the idea that many women feel like a cow when they pump breast.
Although the LV pump is completely noiseless, it does not have his or her tube and fits neatly into the nursing bra, which allows women the freedom to walk, put on baby gloves, and even get outside while pumping.
Anna Ballarin, Mother’s Partner and ECD says: “The LV pump is a revolutionary product that should start off bold and exciting.
Drawing parallels between women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight, revealing the incredible sense of release that the new pump will bring in in an entertaining and related way.
LV pump is not the first time in the news.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two used this product to walk the catwalk for designer Marta Zakuboski.
Hundreds of migrant children have been taken to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has risen, though the monthly border crossing remains relatively unchanged, as the Trump administration's harsh rules and policies introduced make it more difficult for children to be held by their sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are afraid of losing the chance to live in the country themselves, claiming to be immigrants and children without papers.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints, and the information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor orphaned children.
The agency later said that 70 percent of those arrested had no past criminal history.
"About 80 percent of the sponsor's family members are in the country illegally and a large number of them are criminals.
"We're looking for them," said Albion.
In an effort to get the children back into society more quickly, officials introduced some new rules that include having to appear in court within a month of being detained, which was 60 days ago, asylum seekers said.
Many will appear before the immigration judge via video conference calls instead of in person during their cases for legal status.
Those who are deemed unfit for relief will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports published from the system in recent months, the more days children remain in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent incidents or attempts to flee.
Supporters say the concerns are more intense in larger centres like Torniello, where children are more concerned are more likely to be ignored, because of their size.
They also said that moving to the center without allowing children to be mentally prepared or having enough time to not say goodbye to friends could increase the trauma many are already suffering from.
The U.S., French and Turkish "occupational forces" have been ordered to leave Syria immediately.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouallem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Moallem, who is also the country's deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on the ground in the country on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "we will take appropriate measures."
"They have to leave immediately," he told the council.
Moallem stressed that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to fight "until we clear all Syrian territory" against both terrorists and "illegal foreign presence."
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the question of refugees, Moallem said the situation was conducive for their return and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading undue fear" that has prompted refugees to stay away.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with this return," he said.
"They're dealing with a human rights issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction assistance will be provided to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel base provides an opportunity for political talks to move forward.
The Russia-Turkey deal has prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the area, where three million people live.
Moallem, however, stressed that the deal has a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that the military action would work against jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be eliminated."
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura is expected to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moulayem said the Syrian government's participation in the committee should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against unwarranted interference.
Why Trump won in the second round.
In this argument, Trump will win the 2020 re-election, as a number of liberals likely expect his presidency to end prematurely due to impeachment and scandal.
That would be "the most dramatic end of any president!"
So far, there has been no change in the opinion of the public.
Since 2014, the prime-time rating on CNN has more than doubled to about 1.05 million, and for MSNBC, it has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
The average prime-time viewership of Fox News increased from 1.7 million last year to about 2.4 million, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped the ratings with about 3.5 million viewers on the big news night.
About a cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol was destroyed in an attack, Neil Behr, director of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," said, "It's a fire that's attracting people, because it's beyond our understanding."
There is another theory behind the work of veteran comedy writer Neil Scoville and author of "Just the Funny Parts: Some Hidden Hard Truths in the Hollywood Boys Club."
He recalled a taxi trip before the 2016 election.
The driver asked him if he was voting for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asks.
"It's because she's funny," said Miss Scoville.
There is also some entertainment value to this chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, things emanating from Washington can determine the future of Row Five. Wait to see if immigrant families can regroup and what the state of the global economy is.
Turning around is a luxury that only the most privileged audience can afford.
And in spite of that, a conscious citizen would be out of the loop when you see a panel of experts arguing for six hours over Bob Woodward's use of a "deep background" for a "fairy" book, and the $15,000 Otpakhri-skin bomber jacket used by Paul Manafort (the Washington Post says "bullying with hubris"), and about Mr. Trump, Uhm, Usher's description.
I don't think I'll ever see Super Mario again.
Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pon Stars", said, "Part of what he's doing is like reality shows, he's doing something funny every night."

When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, there were 80 sunny weather outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was still sitting at home watching MSNBC.
He could not get himself out of the face-off with Brett Kavanaugh's Senate Judiciary Committee and the future hanging in the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we used to do great shows in the sign days and people would say, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was going to be a joke, but it's real."

In the mid-term elections, the money went into flood waters.
It is not surprising that money is flying in Pennsylvania's 17th vote, as the two candidates are fighting for a single seat, courtesy of a congressional district redistricting.
The recently re-constituted city of Pittsburgh district pits Democrat Representative Connor Lamb - who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is fighting Republican Keith Rothfuss, who is currently representing the 12th District of Old Pennsylvania, much of which is part of the new 17th District.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were constitutionally unfairly structured in favor of Republicans, which led to the redrawing of the map.
The new 17th District's electoral battle has sparked a contest between the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), the money-making body of the main parties.
Lamb became known in March after winning a narrow victory in the widely-publicized special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits are keeping the Democrats a little ahead.
U.S. sentences El Salvador for supporting China, later withdraws
Diplomats have noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, moving a little back from Washington.
Mr Trump held a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and also had a hotel in Panama, but later the partners removed the Trump Organization's director team.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that the department's officials had made the decision to bring back the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
But the sentence was announced only against El Salvador, who received nearly $140 million as American aid in 2017 in the narcotics control, development and economic assistance sectors.
The proposed penalties, which included cutting financial aid and certain visa restrictions, could have been painful for the Central American country due to its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials in North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity as a measure to prevent migrants from crowding into the United States like last year.
But by mid-September, top administration officials had made it clear that they wanted to hold the conference, effectively ending the possibility of El Salvador's execution.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence would address the summit, scheduled for mid-October, to send a message to the administration about imports.
And American envoys from the three countries quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strong message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the statements made by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs on condition of anonymity.
His statement was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration and he also declined to be named.

The next inevitable event could be Robert Mueller's special report on the possible obstruction of justice, which now has enough evidence in the public record.
Mr Mueller's investigation into whether Mr Trump had ties to Russia during the election is reportedly moving in that direction.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to take responsibility, just as he is preparing to go before voters again, and eventually possibly go before a jury with his colleagues.
There are many if-then-else things, and I don't mean that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable - or his European complement.
The two sides of the Atlantic will have a choice as to how long this dispute will last.
In 1938, German officials might have staged a "coup" against Hitler, unless the West stopped him and stood by the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and we have missed the opportunity to avoid many years of assassination.
The course of history often takes such a turn, and it sometimes speeds up, sometimes delays, the overwhelming pace of democracy.
There have been similar developments in U.S. history.
What should we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who will determine the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in danger ever since it was published on paper last year, suggesting he secretly recorded the president's words and speculating about his own inability to hold office.
Mr Rosenstein said the Times story was false.
"What if the FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is proven innocent in the Supreme Court, despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?"
"The big question is, will we have a Congress that can blame Mr. Trump in the midterm elections?"
If we fail this test, democracy will go dormant for a long time.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because we've learned from Prague.

Graham Dornans of Rangers hopeful before fighting Rapid Vienna
Rangers will play their own Rapid Vienna on Thursday, winning against the Austrians after a great draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, giving them a good chance of qualifying for Group G of the Europa League.
Midfielder Graham Dorans played in the first match of the season due to a knee injury, in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes they will be able to get to a better place by relying on this result.
"This point is very important because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went out on the field with confidence and got a point.
I could have won in the end, but overall, the draw tie seems to be a fair result.
They played well in the first half and our team played well in the second half.
It's another big night in Europe.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but it will be a tough game, because they had a good result in their last game, but I am sure with the support of the audience we can get positive results.
Last year was not very good, because of the changes that have taken place in my injury and the club, there are elements of good feeling in the current position.
Our team is also very good and the boys are also having great fun; great training is going on.
"I hope that we can move forward and succeed, leaving the last season behind."
Women are losing sleep over the idea of saving for retirement.
Despite the study participants having an idea of how to handle it, very few individuals have talked about it with their family members.
Half of the nationwide survey respondents said they spoke to their spouse about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they spoke to their children about it.
"People want a family member to think about them, but they're not taking action for the conversation," said Holly Schneider, Nationwide's vice president of life insurance business.
You know where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you don’t express your desires well enough ahead of time, you won’t be able to prepare your family for your ministry.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you want to receive care, as determining the cost of your choice is also very important.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your advisor can look for solutions to handle these costs.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, if you have money—a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy or self-insurance with your own assets to help with these expenses.
Try to avoid legal battles: Try to stay away from legal fights.
Take an appropriate health care proxy so that you can designate a trusted person to oversee your medical care and so that if you are unable to contact a professional, you can comply with your wishes.
And, keep in mind a power of attorney regarding your property.
Choose a reliable person to make your financial decisions and make sure that your bill is paid correctly when you are disabled.
Don’t forget the small things: Imagine that your elderly parents need urgent medical attention and are being taken to the hospital.
Do you know anything about the drug and its effects?
Keep these things in writing so that you can be prepared.

Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the death toll could rise further.
As communications were cut off, relief officials were unable to provide any information about the Dongla Regency area north of Palu, which is close to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been rescued after the disaster.
Some important facts about Palu and Dongla on the island of Sulawesi:
The capital of the state of Central Sulawesi is Palu, which is located at the end of a narrow creek on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongla is a regency that spans around 300 km (180 mi) northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The state has an estimated population of 299,200 as of 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main sources of economy in the Central Sulawesi state, especially in the coastal region of Dongla.
Nickel mines are also important in the state, but most of them are located in Morovali, on the opposite side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to Indonesia's disaster management agency, Palu and Dongla have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed nearly 200 people in Dongla and destroyed more than 100 homes.
In 1996, a tsunami struck Dongla, killing nine people.
Indonesia is frequently hit by earthquakes as it is located in the Pacific Ocean.
Some of the recent earthquakes and tsunamis:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake struck off the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, killing more than 226,000 people in coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.

More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude quake hits one of the Mentawai Islands, just off Sumatra, causing the 10-meter-high tsunami to hit dozens of villages, killing nearly 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hits the Aceh PD Zaya Regency, inciting destruction and triggering panic by inflating the horrific memories of the 2004 tsunami.
There was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed.
2018 - A major earthquake hits Indonesia's tourist island of Lombo, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of homes were destroyed and thousands of tourists were stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin's eldest son has been charged with assault.
According to a report published by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Pauline, from Alaska, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence and attempting to avoid arrest.
According to the police report, when a known woman went to call the police in connection with the incident, he took the phone away from her.
Palin has been placed on an unsecured $500 bond in the custody of Matt-Su Prattial Facility, the KTUU said.
He was produced in court on Saturday, where he claimed to be "confirmed innocent."
He has been charged with a class A offence, meaning he could face up to a year in jail and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with Class B offences, which could result in a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time a criminal complaint has been filed against Pauline.
He was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Phillips, in December 2017.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police for the attack.
The case is currently being heard in the Veteran's Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, and the report alleged domestic violence and the use of weapons while intoxicated.
His wife accused him of cheating on her.
The Veterans Group criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to her PSTD service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication systems have been disrupted and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake was felt in central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
A video of the incident has gone viral on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people had gathered to take part in the beach festival in Palu city.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for suspects in the New York terror attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, the suspect involved in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. This rare punishment has not been awarded to anyone since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is alleged to have attacked a West Side Highway bicycle in Lower Manhattan in October, using a home depot rental truck to smother cyclists and pedestrians.
According to a notice filed with the New York South District seeking the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov was "deliberately" killing eight people and "deliberately" causing serious injury.
According to court documents, both of them are sufficient to execute the death sentence.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, usually involving organized crime, including violence and car wrecks.
Citing the manner in which Saipov carried out the "horrific, brutal and distorted" attack, prosecutors said it required "substantial planning and premeditation."
“Cyfolo Habibullahevich Saipov whose family and friends have been hurt, harmed and damaged by them are Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Anne-Lora Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlize, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Mendoza.”
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York executed the last execution over a decade ago.
Khalid Burns was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in a federal case in New York was in 1953 against a married couple named Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were accused of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenbergs were sentenced to death on June 19, 1953, in an electric chair.
Saipov, a resident of Uzbekistan, did not express any remorse, the court report said.
Police said they were happy with the outcome of the case.
Saipov told officials that he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone at home.
Police said he had also requested that the ISIS flag be put up in his hospital room.
He pleaded guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We think that this event will prolong the trauma in everyone involved in deciding to seek the death penalty rather than grant a life sentence application,” Patton said.
Saipov's legal team had previously called for the death penalty to be abolished.
Tori said Nigel Farage should be given the responsibility of negotiating Brexit ups and downs.
Nigel Farage promised to “integrate the people’s forces” at today’s Tory conference.
The former pro-Kurdish leader said politicians were "touched by the heat" from Eurosceptics - while Theresa May, a Conservative MP, said she should be given the responsibility of negotiating with the EU.
The Conservative leader, Peter Bonn, said at a rally in Birmingham that if Mr Farage had been the Brexit secretary, the UK would have already "moved out" of the EU.
But Ms May’s quest to keep her deeply divided officeholders in one place was once again made clear when she took part in another anti-Brexit protest in the city of Tories.
One of the most pro-Brexit and anti-Brexit checkers is trying to keep the deal in the right direction amid the EU's attack.
His allies have insisted that, despite opposition, they will force Europesceptics and Labour to make a deal with Brussels - and to choose between its package and chaos.
Ms Solihale said at the Live Mint rally that she wanted "Chuck Checkers."
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made a colleague and put in charge of negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we would have come out of it,” he said.
Wellinboro MP added: ‘I will support Brexit, but Chuck Checkers is needed.’
He told his opponents in the EU: “We did not fight a war to live as a follower.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bonn has ruled out the possibility of changing public opinion after the 2016 vote. “The idea that the British people want to change their opinion and stay in the EU is completely false.”
Tory Brexit supporter Andr<0xC3><0xA9> Jenkins was also at the rally, telling reporters: “All I want to say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Checkers don’t like the general public, the opposition won’t vote for it, it’s disliked by the people and activists of our party who have brought us here.
Hurry up and listen to the checkers."
“The Prime Minister is thinking of his office where he should keep his promise,” she added.
Mr Farage said at the rally that if the 2016 referendum decision was betrayed, politicians should be forced to realise the “disappointing situation”.
“It’s a matter of trust between people and politicians,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re going to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with it.’ ”
He added: “I want politicians who are trying to betray Brexit to come face to face with the worst of the worst.
“We are driving the mass forces that have won our Brexit and will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud UK.”
Anti-Brexit protesters held a two-hour march through the city centre in Birmingham.
A group of workers staged a demonstration against the Tories this weekend.
Adonis, the leader of the Labour Party, ridiculed the Conservatives at the conference after suffering security problems on a party app.
“Some people are telling us that they can keep the border free, free trade on the border with Ireland, Canada’s plus plus plus and the IT system healthy,” he added.
“This is a full-scale operation.
"There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren is considering a "hard look" at the possibility of running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would be "deeply concerned" about her running for president after the November vote.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat said this on Saturday about his future during a town hall in the city of West Massachusetts.
Warren, who often criticizes President Trump, is running against G&P state candidate Geoff Diel in the November re-election campaign, who was vice president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There has been a debate around whether he can compete with Trump in the 2020 election.
It was the 36th meeting with his organizers at the Town Hall in Holloway on Saturday evening after Trump took office.
One of the participants asked him if he could run for president.
"It's time for a woman-led government to take over our broken government," Warren said.
Man arrested for shooting at LSU's Sims
Baton Rouge, LA Police said on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Deton Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m., according to the Baton Rouge Police Department. ET News Conference.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting, asking the man to identify the person in the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead on the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media that "Wood Sims was shot in the head and killed," according to 247 Sports.
Wade was attacked by Simpson while trying to save his friend.
Simpson has been charged and admitted to being at the scene, has found a weapon, and has admitted to shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, has played 10 matches since the beginning and played a total of 32 matches last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton moved closer to the world title by relying on the victory of fellow teammate Sebastian Vettel
It became clear on Saturday when Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton and said the Mercedes team's order would play a key role in the race.
Butts started well from the pole, ignoring Hamilton almost exclusively, holding his position in the first two balls and inviting Vettel to attack his own teammate.
Vettel left Hamilton behind in the crowd, which could have been decisive.
The Mercedes driver was beaten in the next lap and followed Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after the Tantan fight, leaving the Ferrari driver with a double-movable, risk of unintentionally missing the opportunity.
Max Verstappen started from the back row on his 21st birthday and was number seven after the first lap.
He then remained in the race for most of the first place, then overtaking Kimi Raikkonen with a bad tire to finish fourth.
He pitched in lap 44, but the remaining eight laps could no longer accelerate, leaving Raikonen in fourth place.
It was a tough day, because Valtteri fought hard all weekend and acted like a real gentleman.
"The team is doing a great job of getting to the starting position," Hamilton said.
It was a bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Finstein at a rally on Saturday for claiming that she did not leak a letter written by Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the issue, but instead said what was going on in the Senate reflected the "low and nasty and false" mentality of the people.
"It's one of the things that could have happened and the beautiful thing that's been going on in the Senate over the last few weeks, you're going to see anger, when you're going to see vile and nasty and lying people," he said.
"When they see the information leak, they will say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.'
Oh, I didn't do that."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, what have you been up to?
Do you remember the answer to your question, "Oh, what?"
Oh, no.
I didn't catch it."
Hey, wait a minute.
"We didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't, we
The letter was sent to Ford Finestein in July, describing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the letter was leaked in September—but Finestein denied that the letter had been leaked from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak anything," Finstein told The Hill's report.
"He asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as he said."
But he was not digested by the president, he said at a rally on Saturday night: "I say what happened, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen a worse body language."
Speaking in favor of the Supreme Court nominee, who is accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said Democrats were using the allegations to their own ends.
They want to regain power at any cost.
Look at the low mentality, look at the rudeness, don't allow anyone to hurt them, don't allow anyone to step in to gain power and control," he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars beat the Belfast Giants in Friday's Elite League game, winning the match back to Dundee on Saturday by 5-3.
The Giants quickly took the lead with the help of Patrick Dyer and Francis Bevelia.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kony equalised for the home team and the Giants went ahead again with Dyer's goal.
For Dundee, Francois Bouchard equalised and then Lucas Landwalt Nielsen scored two goals.
This is the third loss for Adam Kief's team in the Elite League, who came from behind in Belfast on Friday night and defeated Dundee 2-1.
The two teams have met four times this season, of which the Giants have won the previous three matches.
Dyer's first goal came in the fourth minute of the game with the help of Kendall McFly, who doubled Bevilla's lead four minutes later with David Rutherford.
At the start of the game, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10 and then at 15:16 with Matt Markert's help.
At the end of the first half, Dior scored his second goal to make sure the Giants went ahead.
The home side returned to the game and Bouchard returned to parity with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen put Dundee ahead for the first time in the game at the end of the second half and finally hold the lead to ensure a win in the game.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next game on home soil against the Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controllers saved hundreds of lives from an earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been awarded the title of hero after he died while trying to help the plane with more than 100 passengers.
More than 800 people were killed on the island of Sulawesi on Friday after a massive earthquake caused a tsunami that left many people missing.
The area is shaking repeatedly and people are trapped in the ruins of Palu.
But despite all of his colleagues fleeing in fear, 21-year-old Ant<0xC3><0xB3>nio Guan<0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xA1>n Palu's Mut<0xC3><0xAD>ara did not escape from the terrifying swinging control tower of Sis al-J<0xC3><0xBA>f<0xC3><0xAD>r<0xC3><0xAD> Airport.
He went on to confirm that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could fly safely.
Then he jumped down for fear of breaking the control tower.
He later died in hospital.
Johannes Sirite, a spokesman for Indonesia Air Navigation, said her decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News in Australia reported.
We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands, with the disaster management agency saying communications to Dongla, Sigi and Butong cities have been cut off.
"It is assumed that the death toll is increasing as many bodies are trapped under the debris that has yet to be reached," said Sutopo Puro Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
A six-metre-high wave ravages Palu, where mass graves will be arranged on Sunday.
Relief and assistance is being brought by military and commercial aircraft.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “The body is coming in the ambulance every minute. “The body is coming in the ambulance every minute.
Clean water is not available.
Small markets have been looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is quickly taking help to the survivors, but we don't know what we'll see there.
It's already sad, but the situation could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo told Indonesian troops in Palu on Sunday: "I urge you to continue the rescue efforts day and night.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Earlier this year, an earthquake in Lombok, Indonesia, killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air New Guinea says one missing in Legun plane crash
One of the airline's planes crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, where it had earlier reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea reported on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger could not be found.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find him.
The airline declined to provide details of the passenger's age and nationality.
Some local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chak Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and they are all in stable condition.
It is not yet clear what caused the accident.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane went down into the water before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses said the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jensen said the plane went down.
"It's a good thing," Jens said.
Jens said that he and the others crossed the waistwater and reached the emergency door of the sinking plane.
He said the pilots were screaming in terror and suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working on a nearby jetty assisted in the rescue effort by bringing the plane to shore by a boat filled with air before it sank 30 meters (100 feet) into the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the PNG-registered airline over the past two decades, but there have been no air New Guinea accidents.
A woman's body was found in the burning
The prosecution put the case on Saturday to trial again for the man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. judicial analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert on intelligence analysis.
He describes how the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Teles and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers created the night-time episode of his death using cellphone records.
Rowlett said he recovered information from several cellphones that indicated that Teles and Chambers were together on the evening of the death, which was contrary to Teles' previous testimony, the Clarion Laser report.
According to the information, he was with his cellphone chambers at the time, although he claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, who police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that night.
When prosecutors asked if Teles was telling the truth that he was in his truck in Sanford that night, Sanford replied that "False, because his truck was in Nashville that day."
Another discrepancy is that Teles said he had known Chambers two weeks before his death.
According to reports, the couple had known each other for just over a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers's death, Teles deleted text, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He's out of my life," Haley said.
The final arguments in the case are scheduled for Sunday.
The judge said the case is expected to go to trial the next day.

Another black?!
New York Nani has filed a lawsuit against a couple accused of being fired after a "racist" text.
A nanny in New York is suing a concerned couple for discriminatory expulsion after receiving misleading text from a mother in which she is described as "another black man."
The couple has denied allegations of being racist and have sought a case for "injury."
The mother of two, Linsey Plasco-Falxman, expressed disappointment after arriving on the first day of work in 2016 when she found out that Giselle Morris, the new babysitter, was a black.
"Naaaaah another black" Mrs. Plasco-Falxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
Later realizing his mistake, the "uncomfortable" plasco-falxman fired Ms. Morris. She said that her previous nanny who was African-American was working badly had hoped for a Filipino, reports the New York Post.
Ms. Morris was given a one-day lease and then Uber was called and sent home.
Morris is now suing the couple for compensation in the expulsion case and is seeking damages as much as $350 per day for six months, although he was first hired as a stay-at-home nanny without a contract.
"I want to show them, see, this can't be done," he told the Post on Friday, adding by adding more yoga yoga, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple argued against their racist claim that the dismissal of Morris was reasonable, fearing that they could not be trusted after being charged.
"My wife didn't want to tell me what she had sent.
He is not racist.
We're not a racist couple," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you treated badly, even if they were wrong?"
Your new-born child?
Tell me."
Asked about allegations of "injury", Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you want to fight someone like that?"
That's not a good thing," said the investment banker.
The couple's conduct and arguments were strongly condemned on social media in the context of the ongoing legal case in the public court.
Paddington Publications has expressed concern that readers may not be able to relate themselves to the talking bear, published in a new paper
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to say what the mind of the first reader will think before it's published.
It's interesting to know that after Paddington's huge success.
His father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write children's books from the little toy bear, said he was optimistic about his rejection of his work. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book after his death last year was "unsweetened" to him.
Paddington, who he described as "a very important member of our family," said his father was very proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a quiet man, and not an arrogant man," he said.
"But Paddington was so real to him that it was as if your own child had achieved something: you were proud of him, even though you had no role in it.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was a product of his own creation and imagination, he always attributed it to Paddington himself.
My daughter was on her way to death and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
Soon after landing, her daughter was taken to the Nice Hospital, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called and said it was very bad, and she probably wouldn't survive," said Mrs. Adnan-Laperoz.
"Then I got Ned's phone and found out he was going to die in two minutes and I was forced to say goodbye to him on the phone.
And that's what I do.
I said, "Oh, honey, I love you.
I'll get back to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medicine that the doctors gave him to keep his heart was gradually stopping working in his body and getting out of the body.
He died a short time ago, and then he died.
I had no choice but to wait.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold myself."
Eventually Mrs. Edan-Laperoz, then mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane alongside the other passengers - she was unnerved by this difficult situation.
No one knows," he said.
“I kept my head down, my eyes were constantly watering.
It's impossible to describe, but I was sitting on the plane with Ned's unbearable pain.
He needs my love and compassion.
I know how much he loved her.
The woman posted a suicide note on the bridge.
Two women, who lost their loved ones to suicide, work to stop the suicides of others.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries posted cards with inspirational messages on the Welsh Bridge and placed phone numbers where people could call for help.
Ms Davis' son, Tyler, suffered from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want my parents to know what I'm doing," he said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said her son was a promising chef and had an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone would say, her smile brightened the room."
However, before he died, he quit his job, because he "really went into the dark."
Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was found dead in 2014.
Ms Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that this effort will be cut off."
Ms Davis said: "It's important to let everyone know that there are people you can talk to, and they can be friends.
Don't just sit there, talk.
Mrs Humphries, who had been Mrs Davis's girlfriend for many years, lost her 15-year-old partner Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
"He never said he was upset or depressed or anything," she said.
"I noticed some changes in his use of Christmas two days ago.
"He was in a very bad mood on Christmas Day - he didn't even open his eyes when the kids were opening their presents."
He said his death was a huge emotional blow to them, but it had to be overcome: "It created a huge void in the family."
They've ruined us.
But we have to fight on the way."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is under investigation by the FBI
“I thought, if we could give him some of what he wanted — since the investigation time is limited, the scope is limited — we could probably bring some unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday. He added that he feared, given the committee might “fall apart” in the face of this biased stalemate.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their duties are tied to time.
November 6, just five weeks away from the midterm elections - if, as expected, Republicans do poorly, their efforts to get the likes of them to the country's highest court will be too weak.
George W. Bush is calling on senators and lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works in the White House under Mr. Bush. Through him, Mr. Bush meets his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not clear whether Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors "reduced" under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Beyonc<0xC3><0xA9>-Seg, citing data from South Korea's Ministry of Unification, said the number of defections last year was 1,127 - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said strict border controls between North Korea and China are the main reason for the swindling of money and human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment on the matter.
A large number of North Korean defectors have been granted South Korean citizenship.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most have fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly secured Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers these refugees not as refugees, but as illegal immigrants and often forcibly return them to their country.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are still in war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks, which were at the heart of the stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This comes after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they agreed to work toward a nuclear-weapon-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US for the lack of progress.
"Without trust in the United States, we will have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm ourselves," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysteria-ridden". She said she was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has described Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as "hysteria-ridden" and said he was inherently unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
Pelosi told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday of Kavanaugh's reaction to her testimony: "I couldn't have imagined that a woman would have been called hysteria-ridden if she had ever done such a thing."
Kavanaugh has denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blazi when they were both teenagers.
At the time of his initial statement, Kavanaugh was emotional, talking about his family and high school life, screaming and holding his breath.
He strongly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him an "inventive and engaging character" organized by the Liberals, alleging that it was due to the anger of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election defeat.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed he was not qualified for the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he has proved himself to be incompetent in the statements he made and the way he has blocked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
When asked if Kavanaugh would impeach him if he was confirmed and the Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi expressed her disapproval.
"I'll just say that -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not just qualified for the Supreme Court, he's also unqualified for the court he's in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Circuit Court of Appeals in DC.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned that Kavanaugh would oppose the Affordable Care Act, or Roe v. Wade, because he himself was a Conservative Justice.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It can't be allowed to happen that a hysteria-ridden, biased person will go to court and tell us 'isn't that great,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to control it.
It's a fair debate, months and years of anger coming out, and he can't stop crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Ms. Steinmeier told me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's rare, what do you say?"
"I was helped a lot by a woman executive who used to say that she would cry when she was angry, but she chose the approach that when she was angry she would start crying and say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad, because I'm crying.
I'm really angry."
Then he continued.
I thought, "That's great."
Tears serve as an expression of anger, partly because they are primarily victims of misunderstandings.
One of my sharp memories of an early job, in a man-in-chief office, where I once found myself crying in incredible rage, an elderly woman grabbed my scarf — a terrible manager who I always used to scare me a little — who dragged me up the stairs.
"Don't let them see you cry," she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to see you."
Patrick Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der, then Democratic Congresswoman in Colorado, worked with her during Gary Hart's presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a boat in a foreign country with a non-marital affair and walked out of a contest for dirty work, Mr. Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der felt deeply disappointed that there was no reason for him not to be a candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't a very thought-provoking decision," she said, smiling 30 years later.
Seven other candidates are already in the fray, and none of them wanted another candidate.
One called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
He was behind on fundraising when the campaign was initially delayed, and so he vowed not to run without raising $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He saw that if a supporting man was given $1,000, he was given only $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" he wondered.
When he announced that he would not be running a formal campaign, he was overwhelmed with emotion and gratitude to his supporters, making it difficult to raise money, despondency to the system, which he targeted voters rather than delegates, and became ill with anger about gender discrimination.
"You could have thought I had a neurological disorder," Schroder said, recalling the media's reaction.
"You may have guessed that Clinique is my corporate sponsor.
I wondered where they were going to bury me.
"Did he cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could go to Beijing
The first phase of the U.S.-China trade war was tumultuous, and while in the final stages of the war, Beijing could benefit in the long run from the conflict between the two countries, like experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump raised tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum, earlier this year.
The most significant breakthrough came this week, when almost half of the total imports from China, amounting to about $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), were placed on new tariffs.
Beijing retaliated as often as it did every time - most recently raising tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has decided to fight with eyes wide open and there is no chance of losing sight of the world's second largest economy any time soon.
To back Washington means to back down, but publicly bowing to the US will be extremely insulting to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play cards properly, the pressure of a U.S. trade war could help China positively in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"Any quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries, which is far more dangerous than most people think," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the think tank, the Center for New American Security, who studies Asia.
Syria is “ready” to take back its refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and has called for the reconstruction of the seven-year-old war-torn country.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said the situation in the country was improving.
"The situation today is stable and secure due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate to restore normalcy to areas destroyed by terrorists.
The situation is now conducive for the voluntary return of people who are forced to leave the country due to the disruption of their daily lives and livelihoods due to terrorism and the surrounding economic conditions.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people left the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mouallem said the Syrian government welcomes all assistance in rebuilding the country.
He, however, stressed that no conditional assistance would be taken or the help of the rebel-backed countries.
Winner of the European Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5-10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The U.S. has lost to Europe six times in a row and has not won a Ryder Cup since 1993.
Team Europe, led by Danish captain Thomas Beyonc<0xC3><0xA9>, reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States and regain the title.
American star Phil Mickelson, who didn't play well most of the tournament, hit his T-shot in the water at the 16th hole of the Par-3, and lost his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari became one of only 4 in 1 to score above 5-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979, showing brilliant performances in all rounds.
American Jordan Spieth, the lowest-ranked player in Europe, lost 5th and 4th to Denmark's Thorbjorn Olsen.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson lost in 2nd and 1st to England's Ian Polter, who probably played his last Ryder Cup.
Experienced in the eight-time Ryder Cup, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the most-conquered winner in Europe with 25.5 career points.
I usually cry, but I don't cry.
It's been a bad year.
Thank you for believing in me and for believing in me.
I'm so glad I got my cup back.
"It's a success for the team, I'm happy that I was able to help," Garcia said after the European win.
He handed over the responsibility to his countryman, John Ram, who defeated US legend Tiger Woods in singles 2 and 1 on Sunday.
"I'm very proud to have lost Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old John Ram.
Woods has lost four of his matches in France, and his record in the Ryder Cup stands at 13-21-3.
This is inconsistent statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who has only won 14 major titles since Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of high-quality performance performers Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, Team USA has stumbled across the weekend.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of them, they fought.
This morning we had a little bit of a European tour.
We couldn't.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
"We're going to turn around, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee and I'm going to go ahead.
I love these guys and I'm proud to be their leader.
You have to respect them.
We didn't get into the game."
Red stream update: decreased concentrations in pineal gland, manatee and sarasota
A new report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in the concentration of red currents in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, the bloom conditions in the counties of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Colliery have been observed - a sign of a decrease in concentration.
The Bloom of the Red Stream stretches along a coastline of about 130 miles from northern Pinellas to southern Lee County.
The patch can be seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but it's less noticeable than it was last week.
A red wave was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, there were reports of moderate densities along and off the coast of Pinellas County, more than medium densities off the coast of Hillsboro County, higher concentrations on and off the coast of Manati County, higher concentrations on and off the Sarasota County coast, moderate concentrations on and off the coast of Lee County, and lower densities on the Collier County.
There are still reports of respiratory problems in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
There have been no reports of respiratory problems in northwestern Florida over the past week.
