Rapid increase in the number of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The sequence of cases of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend between the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the UK which ensures that, although at different levels depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to advance rapidly in all countries.
Based on the knowledge gained from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units will have to step up preparations for the rapid growth of patients with COVID-19 who will need health care and especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a flurry of pneumonia related to unknown pathogen theory was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the novel coronavirus as an effective ingredient is now being referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Therefore, the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, the authoritative data is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia and most of them recover.
In 14% of those infected, COVID-19 becomes a more serious disease that creates a need for hospitalization, while 6% of those infected experience a serious illness that requires intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is around 4%.
In this study we are reviewing trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the United Kingdom (UK) and comparing them with the Hubei province of China.
We also compare the number of EU/EEA countries and Italy between 31 January - 15 March 2020 with the current number of COVID-19 cases in the UK.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
China's follow-up COVID-19 is more geographically spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following this country.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri and his colleagues reported on the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases according to the WHO's case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020, among those returning from Wuhan in Hubei province of China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 was detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the UK (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported from 31 December 2019 to the said date, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths reported in Italy alone.
The total number of COVID-19 cases and the number of confirmed cases
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) only informs about the count of COVID-19 cases in each country globally, which is updated every day at 8:00 a.m., obtained from the countries' health ministries, national and regional health authorities and official sources such as the WHO.
This data was used to assess trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare what happened in Italy.
As a proxy to the outbreak of the active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day cumulative cases of COVID-19, thus taking into account the natural trajectory of COVID-19 during the 1 January - 15 March 2020 period in each EU/EEA country and the UK.
We have also presented the cumulative number of recorded cases of each country as on 15th March 2020 at 8:00 am and compared it to the cases of Italy for the period 31st January-15th March 2020.
COVID-19 Trends in the EU/EEA Countries and the UK
The trends in the EU/EEA countries and the UK's 14 days of short sequential cases of COVID-19 generally followed the trend of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to rise around February 21 and then rose sharply around February 28, 2020 (Supplementary Material).
This was driven mainly by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown a similar growth trend in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (supplementary materials).
Figure 2 shows a comparison of Italy's numbers with the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK for the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
It is worth noting that, as of 8:00 a.m. on March 15, another 15 EU/EEA countries and the UK have already reported Italy's comparable total cases in just 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 indicates that the pandemic is moving at a relative pace in all countries.
This is despite countries at different levels, despite variations in national public health responses, and despite different definitions of possible cases in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients that must be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in infected areas in Italy described a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
The data on the hospital and/or the admission of COVID-19 cases to an intensive care unit is currently available in only 6% and 1% of cases at the EU/EEA level, respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to complement current surveillance information that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A survey conducted in 2010–11 in a 4.2-bed format per 100,000 population in Germany from 29.2 to Portugal showed a major difference between the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe.
This means countries may have fewer or more resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 people in 2010–11).
With the comprehensive count of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospitals in each EU/EEA country and the UK, modelling circumstances regarding healthcare affordability have shown that there is a <0x3E>90% risk of exceeding the capacity of intensive care beds and this is provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Since the cases have so far been clustered in EU/EEA countries and some regions in the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units generally provide the public with a specific regional service, information about the affected and intensive care beds is recommended to be available in the method of naming the regional units for the Statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.
Experiences from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is making rapid progress in the EU/EEA and the UK.
So the country, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the ongoing community transmission situation of SARS-CoV-2, and for the need for healthcare and especially intensive care, as happened in the affected areas of Italy, to increase the number of COVID-19 patients.
As indicated in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, preemptive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a shift from suppression to mitigation, as the number of cases expected to increase rapidly, if not implemented ahead of time, may not be sufficient to allow decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and respond to the outbreak.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries are likely to further increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on healthcare.
Failing to do so, there is a possibility that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an increase in the number of patients needing intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have killed 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and the rest of the world, bringing about a catastrophe on mankind.
SARS-CoV is similar to its homogeneous virus, which in 2003 caused SARS in tens of thousands of people, SARS-CoV-2 can also be infected with bats and cause the same symptoms through the same procedure.
However, the severity and mortality of COVID-19 is lower than that of SARS but is much more contagious and affects older people and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the topic of rapidly developing research.
We will include basic topics about epidemiology of the disease, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, indicators of the speed of the disease and prevention.
Although many questions still need to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate the dreaded disease.
The spring festival of 25 January 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people, who were asked to stay indoors for the whole of the holiday and for many weeks afterwards, due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and its associated disease was named CoV disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and more than 50 countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, there have been more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 due to the virus, of which more than 40,000 patients have been released and more than 3,000 patients have died.
"WHO warns that COVID-19 is ""the No. 1 enemy of the people"" and probably more powerful than terrorism."
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including virus, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, in less than two months from the first reporting on 7th January 2020 that determined the sequence of the virus isolated from multiple patients.
The review seeks to summarize the progress of research in the field of new and rapidly developing topics.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-caused disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, the epidemic in 2012).
We discussed what we have learned so far about disease prevention and forecasting, and some of the remaining but urgent questions.
CoVs are traditionally considered to be non-lethal pathogens in humans that cause about 15% of the four common colds.
However, in this century, we have been twice exposed to highly pathogenic human CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which started an epidemic outbreak in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which soon spread to many other countries with alarming symptoms and mortality.
So, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak recorded in human history.
As shown in Figure 1, the source of the clusters of pneumonia that were unknown was first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was released.
The first fatal incident in Wuhan was reported on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the pandemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, healthcare providers were informed of the infection, indicating that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was locked down and all its public transport was shut down.
The first clinical study on the disease on January 24 said that only 21 of the 41 confirmed patients had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread to about 50 other countries in China and around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation rapidly escalates, the final magnitude and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centric survey on 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented the following more updated picture of the pandemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but has been found mainly in the 30-65 age group.
About half (47.7%) of those infected were over the age of 50, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 of those infected were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in and around the city.
It takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset of COVID-19 to the diagnosis.
The incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from the onset of the disease to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The initial reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people grew rapidly before January 23, 2020, in line with the time of mass transportation before China's spring festival.
The mortality rate in the confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the cumulative mortality rate among all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subgroup of large and wrapped viruses that contain a single formula of RNA.
They can be divided into four classes or genera, that is, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, in which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect people.
The wrapping wedge (S) glycoprotein for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively binds to its cellular customer angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptideal peptide 4 (DPP4), and then membrane addition occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into cytoplasm; after replicating the viral genome, the envelop forms genomic RNA virion-containing vesicles or plaques with glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which are then mixed with plasma membranes to release the virus.
The first case of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% of the 10 sequential samples collected from the Wuhan marine food market, the epicentre of the outbreak.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 has much more in common with SARS-CoV than MES-CoV.
Through a diffusion electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the ultrafine part of the epithelium of the human respiratory tract.
It was reported that human ACE2 was a receptor in the case of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 bind to human ACE2 relatively weakly compared to SARS-CoV, which is analogous to the fact that SARS-CoV causes less severe infections in SARS-CoV-2 patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 forms a novel tiny protein encoded by orf3b and can also form proteins encoded by orf8.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the ability to cause viral disease and inhibit the expression of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>; however, orf8 does not have any known functional fields or patterns.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and others reported the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution in mixed components, including the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the mixed material with open and closed orientation was combined as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 mixed material could bind to two S proteins, providing evidence for CoV recognition and transmission.
To reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for clinical trials.
Original and intermediate wear
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and have spread to humans through civet cats and camels, respectively.
By making a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered to be the natural hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is equivalent to 96% of the CoVs, like the two SARS-CoVs derived from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate host helped the virus to overcome the species barrier to infect humans, and the path of infection is yet to be explained in detail.
Ji and others that presented the snake as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans that is involved in the recombination of homologous proteins in the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, indicated that long-horned pangolins, often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology among anthocyanins-animal mammals- SARS-CoV-2 and CoV discovered in pangolins.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still a big difference; therefore, the conclusions are still awaited (Fig. 33).
The psycho-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for up to 48 hours in a dry environment outside the body and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; other fatty solvents, other than ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, parasitic acid, chloroform and chlorhexidine, can effectively neutralize the virus.
The entire human race is generally deficient in the immune system of SARS-CoV-2, and therefore at risk of contracting the novel virus.
There are currently no detailed studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only see previous studies on other CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
Typically, after a virus enters the host, it is first identified by the host’s innate immune system through receptors in the pattern. These receptors include C-type lecithin-like receptors, toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors, and NOD-like receptors.
Through various pathways, the virus induces the manifestation of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the transmission of the virus and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus to survive the immune system's response.
Soon, well-adapted immune responses also joined the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in prevention.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8<0x2B> T cells kill virus-infected cells directly.
T-helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help immune cells.
However, CoVs can inhibit the action of T cells by inducing the death of T cells.
The body's immune system, including supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential for fighting viral infections.
For example, isolated antibodies from recovered patients prevent MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive sensitivity to the immune system produces a large number of free radicals locally that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst cases, multi-organ replication can even lead to death.
Older adults and pregnant women with pre-eclampsia are more likely to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection.
It is common that people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is weak are more likely to be infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2, based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, studies on 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period of the disease was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
As described above, a most recent study showed that the gestation period for pathogens, based on the population of 8,866 cases, was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine period based on the most accurate germ time, thus preventing transmission of the virus from infected but asymptomatic people to others.
As a general rule, people who have been infected or come into contact with the virus are usually required to quarantine for 14 days.
Is it necessary to extend the quarantine period up to 24 days?
Fever is often the main and primary symptom of COVID-19, accompanied by no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, drowsiness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients felt dyspnea (shortness of breath) and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulation.
Patients with symptoms of fever and/or shortness of breath and even those with severe fever do not have pulmonary imaging abnormalities but need to be tested for the virus in case of early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 found that 98% of the symptoms had a fever, 76% had a dry cough, 55% had dyspnea, and 3% had diarrhea; 8% needed ventilation support.
Two recent studies of a family cluster and a cluster caused by infection from an asymptomatic person reported similar findings.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 found that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%).
However, 80% of them required ventilation support, which is much higher than in COVID-19 patients and is consistent with higher mortality from MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
Among SARS patients, it was proven that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms, and about 14%-20% of patients needed ventilation support.
By February 14, the global COVID-19 death rate was 2%, while confirmed cases had reached 66,576.
By comparison, SARS had a mortality rate as of November 2002, with 8,096 confirmed cases accounting for 10%.
For MERS, the mortality rate based on a demographic survey in June 2012 was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that 95% of SARS-CoV-2's R0 with a Confidence Interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 was higher than that of R6.47, while SARS-CoV's R0 was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above numbers indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection has a higher spread potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the other two.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is more challenging than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
The onset of clustered disease is often in the same family or from the same gathering or from vehicles like ships at sea.
Patients often have a history of coming into contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks of traveling or living in Wuhan or other infected places or showing symptoms.
However, reports have found that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and recovered patients released from the hospital can carry the virus again, sending a warning to extend the quarantine period.
In the early stages, patients have a normal or low number of white blood cells (particularly lymphocytes).
For example, in 1,099 COVID-19 patients, the number of white blood cells with lymphocytes <0x3C>1 <0xC3><0x97> 109 / L of the morphine <0x3C>4 <0xC3><0x97> 109 / L of the morphine and the number of elevated aspartate aminotransferases and viremia were found to be <0x3C>4 <0xC3><0x97> L of the morphine and <0x3C>10 <0xC3><0x97> L of the <0xCE><0xBC> of the <0xCE><0xB2> of the <0xCE><0xB2> of the <0xCE><0xB2> of the <0xCE><0xB2> of the <0xCE><0xB2> of the <0xCE><0xBC>.
Some patients had increased levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most patients had an increased incidence of C-reactive protein and erythrocytes in the blood.
In severe patients, the level of D-dimer, a fibrin corrosive product present in the blood, increased and the number of lymphocytes decreased.
Abnormality of chest radiography is found in most COVID-19 patients and is characterized by bilateral uneven shade or opacity of rubbing glass in the lungs.
Patients are often diagnosed with asymptomatic pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup, and progressive fibrosis seriously endanger the gas exchange.
The abnormal action of type-I and type-II pneumocytes reduces surfactant levels and increases surface-tension, thereby reducing the ability to expand the lungs and increasing the risk of weakening the lungs.
Therefore, the worst type of chest radiographic findings are often seen in the case of the most severe amplitude of the disease.
On February 18,2020, pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed multinucleated sinus cells in the lungs of a deceased person with pneumocyst dissection, haelain membrane formation, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and in the case of viral infections and ARDS, which are in line with the pathology of SARS and SARS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse-transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the extremely high false-negative rate, which can hasten the pandemic, from February 13, 2020, in China, clinical or clinical manifestations begin to be used for diagnosis (which is no longer solely dependent on RT-PCR).
A similar situation exists in the diagnosis of SARS.
So the connection between the history of the disease, the diagnostic display, the examination of the laboratory and the radiological investigation is essential and necessary to determine the effective disease.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol for using CRISPR-based Sherlock (SHERLOCK) techniques to determine SARS-CoV-2, which uses dipsticks in less than an hour without the need for expanded materials, ranging from 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L in fractions of RSA-2 (inputs per microliter) in 10-18 mol/L.
It is hoped that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and usefulness when clinical samples are verified.
Due to the lack of experience with novel CoVs, doctors can provide primary supportive care to COVID-19 patients as well as previously used or attempted various therapies for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (table 2).
This therapy includes antiviral drugs, immune response suppression, steroids, plasma in recovered patients, China drugs and psychological support current and potential treatments.
It was even suggested to use plasma from recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to produce antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at the beginning and also possibly attacks other organs in low doses that release ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Yet, respiratory dysfunction and disfunction are the main threats and leading causes of death in patients.
Thus, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and is life-saving, and this includes simple oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-sustaining ventilation, and mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an advanced cardiopulmonary bypass technology used to treat life-threatening cardiac or respiratory disorders.
It is also essential to maintain electrolyte balance in SARS-CoV-2 patients, prevent and treat indirect infection and septic shock, and protect the functioning of vital organs.
It has been reported that the cytokine catastrophe results from an excessive response of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine catastrophe is a form of systemic inflammatory response present through the release of cytokine classes including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines release a large number of free radicals through immune cells, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Preventive response suppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine catastrophes, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine catastrophes.
Other immune response suppressive treatments for cytokine disorders include modification of T-cell-directed immune response; inhibition of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; JAK mitigation; blinatumumobab; suppressor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
In order to reduce the severity of the inflammatory damage, steroids were widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS.
Although steroids in high doses were not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the chances of healing.
Nevertheless, short courses of corticosteroids in low to moderate doses are recommended to be used discreetly for severely ill COVID-19 patients.
No effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed at the time of writing.
However, remdesivir, an intravenous application with nucleotide analogues, has proven to be effective for a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug that was initially developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, other single-source RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS, also showed potential resistance to remdesivir.
Based on this, Gilead has supplied this compound to China to conduct a pair of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
Baricitinb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin are recommended as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir may result in diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The interaction of this treatment with other drugs used in patients needs to be carefully monitored.
Production of plasma and antibodies from recovered patients
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients recovering from infectious diseases in order to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy people from catching the disease.
In fact, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood in terms of pathogens.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight germs and other foreign objects, and they identify individual molecules of pathogens and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, and with that, inflammation and viral load were reduced and oxygen saturation in the blood was improved.
However, certain therapies have not yet been developed and verification and clarification are necessary to propose methods for use in large doses before that.
Also, in view of the medical effect, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and there is a huge demand for plasma to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to quickly develop and produce antibodies at a certain stage in the fight against a global pandemic.
Thus, it is more important and fruitful to isolate B cells from recovered patients and to identify genetic codes to monitor or encode effective antibodies against the virus's essential proteins.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effects largely depend on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis based on the TCM-theory.
Most effective ingredients are unknown or unclear, as it is difficult to extract and verify the optimal combination of such ingredients.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients returning from the critical stage.
For example, it was reported that Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
In the treatment of COVID-19 patients in many states of China where TCM has been used in 87% of patients with the highest rate of recovery, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei province, where TCM was used in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, the recovery rate was lowest (13%).
However, this is quite a gross comparison because many other influencing factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing the combined treatment of WM and TCM with the treatment of Western Medicine (WM).
They found that the time required for body temperature to return to normal, symptoms to go away, and hospitalization was significantly lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most interestingly, the slow decline rate (light to severe) was significantly lower than the WM team only in the WM<0x2B>TCM team (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower than the WM team only in the WM<0x2B>TCM team (8.8% vs. 39%).
Despite this, the effectiveness and safety of TCM is waiting for more well-regulated testing at greater levels and more centers.
It will also be interesting to identify the mechanism of work and, if possible, clarify the effective ingredients or combinations of TCM treatments.
Most of the patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are highly contagious and even prone to life-threatening diseases, and people in quarantine also experience anxiety, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, cough and adverse medical effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to further anxiety and stress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a variety of psychiatric symptoms were reported, including long-term depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies.
As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory contact tracing and quarantine can make people more concerned and guilt-free about the impact of infection, quarantine, and stigmatization of their family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects, and people who have come in contact with them, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the formation of mental health teams from multiple branches of medicine, clear communications with regular and accurate updates about the outbreak and treatment plans of SARS-CoV-2, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are necessary to prevent the chain of infection from animal reservoirs and infected people, and often they are complementary to antiviral treatment to control the epidemic caused by the virus that is circulating.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to produce long-term and strong immune antibodies against SARS-CoV and/or to create protective immunity.
The live-attenuated vaccine has been tested on animal models of SARS.
However, before starting a clinical study, the biological efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older people and in the lethal-challenge model and their protection against virus transmission from animal sources to humans has not yet been determined.
This is probably because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and MERS outbreaks continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the existence of zoonotic sources in the affected areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for unvaccinated people is an urgent and important task in controlling the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome this difficulty due to the long time (around 18 months) required for vaccine development and the dynamic change of CoVs.
As a novel disease, the full diagnostic course of COVID-19 is just beginning to mature for thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually, except for pre-diabetes.
But similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with much higher illness and death rates in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is essential for health-care agencies to create a predictive model of the disease to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the disease's rate of progression in COVID-19 patients (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the outcome of SARS disease, which is also true of COVID-19.
Of the 8,866 cases surveyed, 47.7% of those patients who were over 50 had COVID-19, mainly among 30-65-year-olds.
Patients who needed intensive care were also more likely to have other pathologies and complications at the same time, and they were significantly older than others (66 years of age vs. 51 years of age) which indicates age as a speeding factor for COVID-19 patient outcomes.
Gender: Male SARS-CoV-2 infections have been higher in women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
The existence and complexity of multiple diseases: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer severe heart attacks and arrhythmias.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to the ACE2-positive cholangiosite, which may result in a faulty liver function in COVID-19 patients.
It should be remembered that age and underlying disease are strongly related and can interfere with each other.
Unusual information found in the laboratory: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or injury to tissue and have been proposed as a potential disease triggering factor for disease, therapy response, and eventual recovery.
The correlation between the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 with CRP levels was also proposed.
In addition, raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict consequences.
These enzymes are widely released in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during cell damage.
So, these are the traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunction.
Major diagnostic symptoms: Periodic progression of chest radiography and diagnostic symptoms must be considered together with other problems to predict the complications and consequences of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as an ancillary treatment for infectious diseases.
Because high drug levels of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with long-term disability and low quality of life.
So if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period of time in patients with COVID-19.
Stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients were subjected to unusual stress as they often endured prolonged quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and saw close family members and others falling to death.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
So far, according to demographic studies, the epidemiological feature of COVID-19 seems to be different from that of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, which is similar to other CoVs responsible for the common cold.
Thus, by creating great difficulties in controlling the epidemic, patients infected at the initial stage or during the onset of the pathogen can produce a large amount of virus during the day-to-day work.
However, SARS-CoV infection was thought to occur when patients became seriously ill, while most infections did not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Great efforts are currently underway in China, including a lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities in the hope of preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and a continuous quarantine of almost the entire population.
Although these measures have caused dramatic damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating a slowing of the pandemic.
The most promising assumption is that the outbreak of the disease will end in March, and the degenerative phase of the disease will last for 3-4 months.
Some experts, however, are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others speculated that COVID-19, which is proving to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others set a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and hinted that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbinate and throat swabs of patients who recovered and were discharged from hospital two weeks ago, indicating that the newly identified virus would become a cyclical event similar to influenza.
However, there are optimistic signs in China based on the falling number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may have worked.
It was initially predicted that Ebola would cause one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been brought under control.
It is also possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may weaken in the case of infection and eventually become extinct or become a relatively less infectious virus in coexistence with humans.
Below is a comparison of SARS and MERS with the COVID-19 pandemic (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is also highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing and also through direct contact with potentially contaminated material by the virus.
The virus was also found in the mole, which highlights new possibilities for feces-to-mouth infections.
A recent study on 138 cases found that 41% of the cases were likely caused by nosocomial (hospital-borne) infections, including 17 patients with other pre-existing diseases and 40 healthcare providers.
Thus, people, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even those close to the patient or infected people, must take adequate precautions to keep them safe.
Wearing a mask can be used as a first stage of defense to reduce the risk of infection; the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series <0x23>1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent small droplets of fluid from a potentially infected person from spreading through the air or getting stuck on the surface of objects, from which they could spread to others.
However, only N95 (series <0x23>1860s) masks can protect against inhalation by small virions such as 10 to 80 nm, only 5% of the virions are fully penetrated; the size of SARS-CoV-2 is equal to that of SARS-CoV, and both are about 85 nm.
Since the particles can even enter through five consecutive surgical masks, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (series <0x23> 1860s) masks, not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear isolation gowns that fit, to further reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also spread through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus probably entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent face coverings or goggles when working with patients.
In the case of the public in the affected or potentially affected areas, everyone is advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors to quarantine themselves, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of three feet is considered appropriate for a person to stay away from a patient.
This adopted system is an effective method to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a new virus in the human world, China's high alert should have been taken based on deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak due to its high resemblance to SARS-CoV as reported on January 7, 2020.
However, until January 19, 2020, the director of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan consoled citizens by saying that the novel virus is less contagious and that reproductive capacity is limited from humans to humans, and that there are no problems with the prevention and control of the disease.
The message significantly eased public fears, especially as the entire country was preparing for the spring festival and significant time was lost in Wuhan to curb the disease to a minimum.
China's disease control agencies can adopt this rigorous learning and make essential improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations need to be more careful when declaring (1) public as every word citizens will consider and it can change their attitude and decision; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to the unwanted information received from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) be more reactive to the goal of controlling the pandemic at an early stage rather than trying to provide comfort to the public; and (4) public awareness of the pandemic and measures to raise awareness of the disease.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread throughout China and at the time of writing this report, it has spread to more than 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and has similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a feeling like the return of SARS.
However, there are some noticeable differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are necessary to suppress the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and affects men more than women, and the severity and mortality rates are also higher in older people than young people.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients also transmit the virus in asymptomatic conditions, while SARS patients usually do so in severe conditions, making it much more difficult to suppress COVID-19 infections than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative for some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients can again be positive for the virus.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
In view of such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, a number of important issues remain to be addressed as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-Ny CoVs, we still do not reach the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species to transmit the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answer to <0x23>1 and 2, we cannot effectively reduce the spread of infection and the outbreak could return at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assessments have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-containing cells of other organs?
Without a clear answer to this question, we will not be able to get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How does the virus spread through the human body?
Will it become a global pandemic, a death like SARS, or a re-emerge like the flu occasionally?
This is essential, but it takes some time to find the answers to the above and many more questions.
But no matter what the price it demands, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
Animal source of human coronaviruses
Transformation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their host, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illnesses like the common cold.
The outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have shown the currency upside down to reveal how devastating and lethal the HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 brought CoVs back to the forefront of discussion, and it surprised us by showing higher transmissibility and lower pathology than its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease and understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs can help us.
Most HCoVs originate from bats where they are less pathogenic.
Some HCoVs have also been identified as intermediaries.
The identification of animals has a direct effect on the prevention of human diseases.
Investigation of CoV-suspension in animals can also provide important insights into CoV pathology in humans.
In this review, we give an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, focusing on their history of discovery, as well as their animal origin and interrelated transmission.
Importantly, we compare and contrast different HCoVs from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
In this context, the current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been discussed.
In addition, the need for successful assay replacement and the effects of the virus' evolution on the severity of the disease are also noted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of coated, positive-sensitive, single-stranded RNA viruses.
"These viruses harboring the largest genomes of 26 to 32 kilobases of RNA viruses were called ""CoVs"" because of the crown-like organelle under the electron microscope."
Structurally, CoVs have an integral genome that belongs to the same organization.
About two-thirds of genomes contain two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted to pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins (translation).
Polyproteins are processed to produce 16 more non-structural proteins, which have been named nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins including wedges (S), wrappers (E), membranes (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Some lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), most of which contain HCoVs in the beta-CoV gene and are divided into four genera (A, B, C and D).
Ethnic evidence has shown that bats and rats are the gene sources of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the mainstays of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continually crossed interspecies barriers and emerged as some of the major human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as common cold and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing acute lower respiratory tract infections in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a higher probability of exposure outside the lungs.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was collected from nasal discharge in patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gathered through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the idea was widely accepted until the SARS outbreak that transmission of HCoVs was generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most devastating in recent history, infecting 8,000 people and had a crude death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused epidemics to continue on the Arabian Peninsula and spread sporadically to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causal agent of the current coronavirus disease pandemic 2019 (COVID-19), which has resulted in more than 3,120 deaths and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm bells are ringing and the world needs to get ready for the upcoming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
Each of the seven HCoVs has animal sources from bats, rats or domestic animals.
Multiple evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where the viruses show well-adapted and non-pathogenic but great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented huge medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
The search for animal sources of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the causes of natural history, driving force, and species-to-species (speech jumping) limitations.
With important factors involved in preventing future spillovers, it can guide or manage the search for the base, intermediate and amplified animal host(s) of SARS-CoV-2.
In this review, we present an overview of the animal sources, interspecies infections and pathogens of HCoVs.
In particular, we would like to highlight this general context and discuss how the parent viruses of HCoVs are generally untreatable in their natural Aadhaar host but become pathogenic after they enter the body of the new host.
We also review the trends in the evolution of HCoVs where pathogens often decrease as transmissibility increases.
The results of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak have also been discussed in this regard.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Various CoVs were collected from various infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs, before the B814 of HCoV-229E strain was first collected from the nasal discharge of patients with the common cold.
In the last decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
An overview of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and educational.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract in patients with upper respiratory infections in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in the line of WI-38 lung cells.
HCoV-229E showed common cold symptoms in infected patients, including headache, sneeze, feeling sick and sore throat, and fever and cough in 10<0x7E>20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was collected from the organ culture and subsequent recurrent growth of the virus in the brains of dairy rats.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to the symptoms caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be symptomatically distinguished from the infection of other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread worldwide and are mainly transmitted in winter climates during the temperate season.
Usually, the onset of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
According to a study by human volunteers, healthy people with HCoV-229E developed mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients had severe lower respiratory tract infections.
"SARS, also known as ""Atypical Pneumonia"", was the first HCoV-related pandemic recorded in human history, and its causal representative was SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered."
The first case of SARS was found in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8,096 cases reported across many countries and continents, of which 774 have died.
In addition to the super-spreaders, it was estimated that each case could increase by about two ancillary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and showing the final signs of viral load as the illness appears on the 10th day.
In patients infected with SARS-CoV, initially muscle soreness, headache, fever, feeling unwell and after a cold, shortness of breath, cough, and sore throat appear as delayed symptoms.
Lymphopenia, distorted liver function tests, and increased creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Dispersed alveolar damage, proliferation of subcellular cells and growth of macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation at a later stage.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, multiple organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney, can become infected with these serious events, usually accompanied by cytokine disruptions, which can be particularly severe in patients with immune system disorders.
The virus was first collected from the open lung biopsy of a relative of an index patient who traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of effort has been devoted to HCoV research.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was collected from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands.
It was primarily prevalent in young children, the elderly and patients with respiratory illness whose immunity is low.
Common diseases caused by HCoV-NL63 in choreza, eyelid, fever and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study described a collection of the same virus from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is widespread worldwide.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 is the cause of about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and most of these occur in the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngeitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was collected from a 71-year-old man suffering from pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to group-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma disease.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, which causes respiratory mild diseases.
All of these four group-acquired HCoVs are well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause high pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons, such as the rare case of the highly damaging subtype of HCoV-NL63 that has recently been reported in China.
Usually, when these HCoVs are able to transmit effectively and maintain themselves in humans, they become less harmful or infectious.
In 2012, MERS-CoV was first collected from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and respiratory failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the laboratory-confirmed cases have originated from the Middle East, cases from outside have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia, with a secondary spread in occasional close contacts.
In 2015, another second-stage outbreak occurred in South Korea where 186 confirmed cases were found.
Marked by progressive acute pneumonia, the clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also had acute renal failure, which is so far unique to MERS in the HCoV-caused disease.
More than 30% of patients have symptoms of abdominal diseases such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratories have confirmed more than 34.4% of deaths, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses in the human body.
In mid-to-late December 2019, classes of patients with pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, as being traditionally associated with cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of low respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern and named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a mortality rate of roughly 3.4%.
Significantly, the fatality rate for Hubei in China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, presented as fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea can also be seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can lead to rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although 82% of high nucleotide sequences are very similar to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 due to homology, they cluster in different branches of the ethnic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Infected asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may play a role in its rapid spread around the world.
Comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal very similar interests and differences.
First, the course of the pathogenesis and the duration of the course of the HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is followed by SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs infecting the public (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features that are typically seen with non-specific, mild, or even asymptomatic representations of the community's acquired HCoVs during transmission.
On the other hand, a small proportion of severe cases of COVID-19 also show symptoms of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 infection group shows interesting characteristic patterns of both acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection is at least as high as group-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it is yet to be verified whether SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are the same as SARS-CoV-2 when transmissibility decreases after passage in humans.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in saliva samples.
It remains to be clarified by future studies whether fecal infection with SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in cases such as SARS-CoV at least in some circumstances.
It is of particular interest to see if SARS-CoV-2, like community-acquired HCoVs, exhibits the same seasonality.
Still, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathology and sustainable spread after its passage in humans, will be influential in the eventual outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
The four groups that cause mild symptoms are all well-adapted to people with acquired HCoVs.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both can be the successors of the ancient HCoV epidemic.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and people who have developed severe HCoV disease have been eradicated.
In order for this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in sufficient quantities to accumulate adaptable mutations that fight the causes of host restriction.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the more people infected with it, the more likely it is to fully adapt to humans.
If it is well-adjusted, it will be difficult to stop the infection in the human body by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, four group-acquired CoVs have been circulating in the human population, triggering a common cold in patients with the common immune system.
These viruses do not require any animal support.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well-adapted in humans and their transmission in humans cannot be sustained.
They need to be maintained and spread in zoonotic bases, and possibly seek opportunities to spread through one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts to a human target.
SARS-CoV-2 has features that are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
At least so far, it is highly transmissible, just like community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than group-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It will have to be seen whether it fully adapts to humans and continues to spread among humans without any adhaar or intermediate animal host.
Before we discuss the animal sources of HCoVs, we would benefit from discussing the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, base, intermediate, and amplification hosts of HCoVs.
An animal acts as an evolutionary guardian of HCoVs if it harbors close-related predispositions by sharing higher homology at the level of nucleotide sequences.
The ancestral virus usually adapts well to the host's body and is non-infectious.
Similarly, an aadhaar seeker provides HCoVs with continuous and long-term shelter.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host before or right around humans, it does not fit well with the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and can play an amplifying host to replicate the virus transiently and then it can play a role in amplifying the level of human infection by transmitting it to the human body.
If the HCoV is not able to continue the infection between the intermediate hosts, the infection can be prevented.
In contrast, HCoVs can also be adapted to intermediate hosts and can trigger long-term outbreaks.
In this case, the intermediate parenthesis becomes the natural parenthesis.
Epidemiological data from the event revealed that there was a history of animal contact with the SARS outbreak.
The subsequent seroprevalence findings indicated that the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG was higher among animal traders than in the general population.
A raccoon dog was first identified in the markets of Gandhgokul (Pagoma larvae) and Livestock to carry a SARS-CoV-like virus that was almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the data that no other cases of SARS have been reported after killing all the cockroaches in the markets.
However, it is known that the masked palm sieves of wild or farm animals without exposure to the live animal market were largely negative for SARS CoV, indicating that the masked palm odors would only act as intermediate amplifier shelters but not as a natural base for SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the Guangzhou market has anti-SARS-CoV antibodies in a variety of animals, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals can also act as intermediate amplifying hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All of these are thought to be single-faced carriers of SARS-CoV.
The next discovery of natural animal hosts of SARS-CoV has revealed a close related bat CoV, the SARS-related Rhinolophos bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese herpes bat, known as HSR-CoV. The next discovery revealed a close related bat CoV, SARS-associated CoV.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have formed the basis for the new idea that bats harbor emerging human pathogens.
A number of SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have been identified from bats, but none can be collected as live viruses except for a designated WIV1.
Human angiotensin converter enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as a customer of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 obtained from a sample of bat feces was shown to be used as a receptor to enter the cell, civet and human ACE2.
Interestingly, serums from patients with SARS who were recovering were able to inactivate WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which share 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Although there is a high level of homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not an immediate parental virus and bats are not an immediate aadhaar host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analyses categorize MERS-CoV into the same class as BAT CoV-HKU4 and BAT CoV-HKU5.
BAT uses the same host receptor, dipotidyl peptides 4 (DPP4), to enter CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV viruses.
The RNA polymerase sequences of RNA-dependent MERS-CoV are phylogeneticly close to replicas of bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
Thus, bats may not be the immediate aadhaar host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, Middle East studies have shown that one hump camel is seropositative for MERS-CoV-specific suppressive antibodies, just like camels of Middle East origin in several African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was collected from the nose swab of a humming camel, which further indicates that the camel acts as a true ashtray of MERS-CoV.
It's also worth noting that although experimentally infected camels with MERS-CoV usually have mild symptoms, a lot of virus sedation (virus shedding) has been seen.
Notably, infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory system, but also through the anus-oral route, which is also the main way to spread the virus from bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or the transmission pathways associated with an unknown species of animal that harbors MERS-CoV.
The bat CoV RaTG13, collected from Rhinolophos affinis bat, has a 96.2% similarity to the nucleotide homology of SARS-CoV-2.
In the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also very much in favor of determining the parental relationship.
This means that bats may not be a direct aadhaar host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 unless there is a nearly identical bat CoV in the future.
Perhaps, animal shelters between SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild animals sold and killed in the Huanan seafood wholesale market, with many of the early cases of COVID-19 being related, indicating a potential animal-to-human transmission event.
A number of recent studies based on methogenic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as banui (Manis Javanica) may also carry the ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
85-92% of these novel mononucleosis CoV genomes are a replica of the nucleotide sequence homology SARS-CoV-2.
However, with about 90% uniformity at the level of nucleotide sequences, they are equally involved with RaTG13.
They bind to two sub-genres of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in an ethnic tree, one of which shares a similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 by identifying 97.4% amino acid sequences.
In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are further deviated, although sequence homology is of a higher degree of genome-wide.
A previous study on sick bonsai also reported the detection of a continuous sequence of viruses from lung samples, which have been shown to be related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted a variety of assembly methods and manual representations to create partial genome sequences, taking about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct panoramic source of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequencing between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoV-related variants.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is less than that between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The trajectory of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.
Although most sequence homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and RBD in Banui, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the most genome-specific sequence homology.
It is highly hypothesized that the high similarity between SARS-CoV-2's RBD-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selectivity-mediated convergent evolution.
A third wild animal species, a wild boar, favors recombination between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13.
As a driving force in evolution, the recombination between beta-CoVs is widespread.
The direct source of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known.
In addition to high pathogenic HCoVs, animal sources of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E originated from bat CoVs, although parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rats.
It is reported that a bat CoV, called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian ridge CoV) detected in three North American bats with HCoV-NL63, showed a close relationship.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, called the hipposideros/Ghanakovam/19/2008, although comelids have also been suspected to be its intermediate host.
For clarity, the current knowledge of animal sources of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Ethnic analysis has provided evidence of inter-species transmission events in the history of CoVs.
In the 1890s, when HCoV-OC43 infected humans from domestic animals by crossing species, a respiratory epidemic was observed.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is relatively less clear.
Alpha-CoVs of bats closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
One of them is Alpaca-Alpha CoV.
There is evidence to support the transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, bats may be in contact with humans in a shared ecological environment but not with alpacas.
Instead, people have close contact with the alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are diverse and non-infectious in bats, while alpaca causes an outbreak of respiratory disease in alpha-CoV infected animals.
Alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that the alpacas receive alpha-CoV related to HCoV-229E from humans cannot be excluded.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hedra virus.
So it is not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, bat alpha-CoVs act as a gene pool for HCoV-229E, but the alpaca and one hump camel can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus between humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as a great example of the transmission of interspecies infections from bats to one humpback and from one humpback camel to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known in early detection and is further strengthened by subsequent studies.
It is clear that bats provide a rich base of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Long-life, luxuriously full colonies, close social interactions and strong flying skills are favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal 'virus spreader'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has come into contact with a humongous camel several decades ago.
It adapts well to these camels which have evolved from an intermediate shelter to a stable and natural shelter.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low prevalence rate in these animals.
Its sporadic infection among humans is an accident and humans remain the last refuge of MERS-CoV because its infection cannot be contained.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
In the case of SARS-CoV, they may be the latest hosts for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, similar to sedatives.
Various possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 being transmitted from interspecies animals to humans may have to be included in future studies or may have to be ruled out.
First, bats can be the Aadhaar hosts of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
People can share the ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, wild boars could be one of the intermediate amplifying hosts where a SARS-CoV-2-related virus was newly introduced.
People are infected with the virus by cutting and eating the meat of the victim.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are unprotected against SARS-CoV-2.
A study of domesticated and wild animals for antibodies has been confirmed.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is still under investigation.
In addition to a wide variety of animal shelters, the three main causes of viral side are also important in helping CoVs overcome interspecies barriers.
First, they have a relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
"Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoVs can be considered ""moderate"" to ""high"" depending on the phase of the novel host's CoV adaptation, and the average replacement rate <0x7E>10-4 replacements will be 2 per site per year."
CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, the elimination of which results in extremely high variability and weakness or even an inability to survive.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir is known to form a CoV replica by suppressing this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 ingredients tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the mutation rates of CoVs are about one million times higher than those of their host.
In addition, the rate of conversion is often higher when CoVs do not adapt well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a higher mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, which is an indication of more easily adapting to humans.
Perhaps it has already adapted to another shelter close to the people.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV, which fits well with a single hump camel.
In theory, there is an extremely low chance that the SARS-CoV-2 genetic drift vaccine and antivirals will quickly become ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome of CoVs uses additional flexibility in genome expression and recombination, thereby increasing the likelihood of interrelated co-evolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of CoVs when conditions become favorable.
It is supported by a lot of unique encoded open reading frames and protein functions at the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2> end of the genome.
"Third, CoVs change templates randomly and often while replicating RNA through a unique ""copy-paste"" process."
Strand switching often occurs during CoV RNA transcription in a host that acts as a mixing vessel.
Higher homogeneous full-length and subgenome RNAs can be recombined to form new CoVs.
The phylogenetic evidence for natural recombination is found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, and in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-nurturing interactions related to infection
In addition to the three viral components described above, viral interactions with host receptors are another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
In the meantime, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as an ideal example, which also showed evidence of positive selection when interspecies transmission occurs.
Based on a comparative analysis between the collection of human and endogenous SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to be able to adapt quickly to the RBD mutations in different host species, especially S proteins.
RBD usually interacts with the cellular receptor in the S protein of a CoV and is sharply selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is contained in the S1 fragment in the 318th to 510th amino acids that bind to human ACE2 as well as its correceptors for viral penetration.
SARS-CoV's RBD is capable of recognizing ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, including bats, civets, rats and raccoons, which can cause interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found to be different from those in human and RBD, and 4 of them are located in a customer-restricted design to interact with ACE2 receptors.
Civet SARS-CoV RBD contains K479N and S487T mutations, which can increase the ability of humans to exchange spike proteins with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids can be serious for virus-related adaptations in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are similar cellular consumers.
The 30% difference between the S1 unit of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV indicates that the tendency for its S protein to bond with human ACE2 may vary.
In fact, a cryo-EM study indicates a 10 to 20 times higher bonding tendency than what is present in human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It is also important to determine if any other co-occurrence may be required for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also bound to ACE2 but with a different part of S.
There are many other HCoV consumers, such as Aminopeptide N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetyllated salicylic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can also be thought of as the reason for the successful adaptation of these CoVs to humans after they become infected with endogenous species from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the results of interspecies transmission of HCoVs are also driven by factors of dependence and limitation on other hosts.
The division of these host proteins between humans and HCoVs, such as bats, humpback camels, and rats, can inhibit interspecies transmission.
HCoVs must capture the host dependency factors for a successful interspecies transmission and destroy the host restriction factors.
In this case, the molecular determinants and characterization of this important field of virus-reporting are yet to be identified and described.
Using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR, a neutral genome-wide screening of host dependencies and restrictions for SARS-CoV-2 can be fruitful.
The rise of novel HCoVs: back to where they started
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs act as a gene pool for HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the potential to severely modify viral phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been found to be important in adapting to humans as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were collected but they have been found to encode differentiated ORF8 proteins.
A 29-nucleotide removal feature of SARS-CoVs has been found in strains collected at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it seems to be an adaptive modifier that encourages shelter reversal.
Also, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination with alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of small recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Recombinant locations were also identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10 and nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the pandemic MERS-CoV went through recombination events between different tribes, which occurred in the case of a humpbacked camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, there have been reported cases of recombination in other HCoVs, where HCoVs recombine with CoVs of other animals in their non-structured genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to involuntary changes in the viral genome, possibly as a result of the release of viruses from selection pressures such as the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype formula due to the removal of two nucleotides.
Although intact ORF4 can be seen in bats and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, Alpaca alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide placed inside, with the result seen in the frameshift.
Last but not least, the evolution of the novel HCoVs is also driven by the pressure of their selection.
When bats were infected by CoV, they were asymptomatic or had only mild symptoms, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It has been found that bats adapt well to CoVs both naturally and physiologically.
For example, errors in the activation of reactions in favor of inflammation in bats efficiently reduce the pathology driven by CoVs.
In addition, the natural killer cell activity of bats has been suppressed due to the low expression level of the repressive natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the main histocompatibility complex I class molecule.
Moreover, suppressing the replica of high-dose reactive oxygen species (ROS) CoVs generated from bats' high metabolic activity and affecting proofreading by exoribonucleases can do both, thus providing the selection pressure needed to produce the strains of the virus when in contact with a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains can also develop through recombination that leads to the acquisition of new protein or protein character for host adaptation.
So, the possibility of the emergence of three new HCoVs in the last two decades is not coincidental.
CoVs cause mild symptoms in non-infectious or their Aadhaar patrons, such as bats and camels.
They grow strong without the strong resistance of the hostess.
Why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what causes severe cases of human infection is covered in this.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the over-activation of the immune response and the cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in the case of asymptomatic carriers, the resistance response is distinguished from the CoV replica.
The same technique of disconnecting the immune response may have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon reaction is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, the application of type I interferon to at least the first stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
Also, the NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bats is flawed.
By this logic, the prevention of NLRP3 influenza, including MCC950, may be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common factors that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
On the one hand, a bat beta-CoV has been found that interacts with SARS-CoV in 95% nucleotide homology, while on the other hand, there is a bat-CoV that interacts with SARS-CoV-2 in 96% nucleotide homology.
Although sardines and other animals found on the market have been known to harbor SARS-CoV-like viruses, the immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Bizarrely homogeneous bony beta-CoVs have been found with SARS-CoV-2, indicating that bony beta-CoVs will act as one of the intermediate hosts or that bony beta-CoVs may contribute to the gene fragmentation in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally man-made.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, CoVs have returned to the center of discussion once again.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals significantly changed our understanding of the importance of animal sources and animal bases of HCoVs in human transmission.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a bat source and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since the SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and smog in the market, killing the smog there by closing the wet market could have effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
By the same logic, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent animal transmission in the wake of the discovery of multiple strains of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, what exactly and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through bats and other mammals is yet to be clarified in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed for a long time in one humpback camel.
These camels serve as the main source of meat, milk, leather and fur for the local people in addition to the important means of transportation.
They are spread across the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for MERS control, as was done in China's wild animal market to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the repeated outbreak of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control systems.
As we are not able to eliminate these viruses, a new genotype outbreak may appear.
Many types of CoVs are spread by nature.
In particular, bat CoVs with animal potential are very different.
There is great potential for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, eventually leading to the emergence of new CoVs that will be more transmissible and/or deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned in order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the testing of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there should be a plan for better preparedness and response.
Viruses have been around the world for a long time.
They remain in their own natural state until they have the opportunity to spread.
Although bats have many features that support the spread of the virus, the chance of humans coming into contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if humans are made aware to stay away from them.
In order to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary, which will prove effective in preventing future outbreaks of human-to-animal transmission.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent zoonotic diseases in humans is to stay away from the environmental niche of the natural base of animal viruses.
Several pieces of the puzzle of the animal source of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the parent virus of SARS-CoV-2 to the wild, it is necessary to see under what circumstances bats and wild boars can share the same environmental niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it should determine how people come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as an actual intermediate host, it needs to clarify how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental transmission should be done.
If it's bats, pangolins, or any other mammal, it's expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical-causing viruses will be identified in its natural host in the future.
Continuous investigations in this area will explain the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the criteria for "presumed infected" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19.
On 6 February 2020, our team released a quick consultation guide for the detection and treatment of the Novel Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guide provided our experience and made good reference for the global fight against this pandemic.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge based on ongoing research findings and experience in clinical practice is also gradually increasing; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidance and provided a brand new diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases," in accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread, which has been officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In order to fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has prepared a quick consultation guide and it has been published in the online Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
Since its release, it has received a huge response.
Remember, COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge based on ongoing research findings and experience in clinical practice is also gradually increasing; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostics and Treatment Guidelines (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, a total of seven editions have been published, each of which contains significant changes to some content.
Now that Zhou and his colleagues have made a comment about our instruction, they have provided a proposal to determine a simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our guidance and has also made valuable references to this global pandemic.
We appreciate their hard work and thank them.
However, they will also have to update their work according to the latest diagnostic and medical guidelines for COVID-19 (trial 7th edition) and the latest research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case, a detailed analysis must have two clinical symptoms with one of the epidemiological historical features, or if there is no clear epidemiological history, three clinical symptoms must be met.
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of infection in the city of Wuhan and its surrounding areas, or the history of travel to the affected areas, or other communities where confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days, etc., prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases, and (4) a history of exposure to other cases of fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan, or surrounding areas.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) Total White Blood Cell Counts at the stage of early onset show normal, decreased or decreased lymphocyte count.
In order to diagnose confirmed cases based on suspected cases, one of the following pathogenic or serological evidences should be present: (1) the rate of progression of SARS-CoV-2 to the critical level of positive real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full gene sequence of the virus is confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2; and (2) high homogenity or similarity with the novel coronavirus known to ISD-CoV; (3) the serum test.
We found that, in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) versions, nucleic acid determinant real-time PCR test and blood samples were included in the inhalation.
The pathological detection of blood samples was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) editions; and then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the researchers' continued work to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, including blood samples of respiratory tract samples, which increase the availability of different samples and which help bring certain antibody-positive results to confirmed standards.
Moreover, more and more evidence has been found, reminding us to be wary of undiagnosed and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, Zhou and her colleagues should update the flow list, as they categorize people who do not have clinical symptoms as "low-risk."
The score system also needs to be verified in subsequent clinical practices and studies.
In conclusion, we hope that there will be more direct evidence and that readers will call to provide their comments.
In order to diagnose "presumed to have been infected" and "confirmed cases," we recommend identifying them and following the most recent directives of our country.
Our team will update our guidance in a timely manner to help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
Yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh reported that the number of recorded infections included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported.
Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, director of IEDCR, said four men and one woman were among the dead.
According to Dr. Mirjadi, two of the victims were over the age of 60, two were between the ages of 51 and 60, and one was between the ages of 41-50.
He added that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency that one of the victims was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Friendship Hospital.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said that public transport will remain closed for more time than initially planned until next Saturday.
The closure of this public transport started on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods such as medical, energy and food was still allowed.
On March 8, the first case of COVID-19 infection was recorded between two people who returned to Italy in Bangladesh and the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, all three have recovered so far.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than one million people worldwide.
Data from Johns Hopkins University indicated on Thursday that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection has exceeded one million worldwide.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to the disease caused by coronavirus, COVID-19.
The important event took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia's first coronavirus-related death.
As of Thursday, North Korea had claimed it was one of the few remaining countries free from coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization recorded 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases, in the previous 24 hours on April 4 at 10 am Central European Time (0800 UTC).
In the United States, at least 5,900 deaths were linked to more than 244,000 coronavirus cases recorded.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, more than 1,000 people in the United States died from coronavirus on Wednesday.
Across the world, countries have announced stricter measures to curb the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the lockdown in the city until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin has announced that payments will continue to be made even if the Russians don't get to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the national emergency by 15 days; the vote was passed by 215 votes in favor, ten votes against, and 10 votes against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the whole day; the previous curfew was only effective from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand had planned to implement a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has announced that the state has extended its stay at home order until May 1.
Australia has reduced the number of stores selling toilet paper.
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australia's store chain Olworths and Coles reduced the limit on the purchase of toilet paper per transaction at all stores at the national level to two and one package, respectively.
Also, on Monday, ALDI introduced a one-pack limit.
These restrictions were posted as messages at checkouts and on the chain's Facebook pages.
It has been reported that customers were stocking up for fear of COVID-19, thinking that people had to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the sale of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
These changes follow the limitations of the four pack per previous transaction that Woolworths and Coles launched on 4th and 5th March, respectively.
"On March 8, Coles reported in the media that the four-pack ban had been rolled out, but that ""everything was sold out within an hour of delivery in many stores"", calling the demand ""unprecedented"" and calling it ""unexpected"" in a Facebook post on ALDI on Tuesday."
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
The costco store in Canberra was also allowed for two packs last week.
To further reduce the deficit, Coles orders larger packages from suppliers and increases the rate of repeat of supply, Woolworths orders additional stocks, where ALDI makes stock available in advance for a planned special Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers try to increase stock, but local council restrictions during the time of delivery by truck make it difficult to do so.
As suppliers try to meet demand, he expects production costs to rise.
ALDI announced on Tuesday that after leaving the stock in advance, some stores may not be able to handle Wednesday's special sales.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail sales expert from the University of Queensland Technology, said the stores fill their own stockpiles every night.
He commented that toilet paper is a heavy material that keeps its collection numbers very low and when all is sold out, the huge shelves are empty and make the feeling of scarcity even stronger.
"According to ABC News, ""Coles and Woolworths are of the opinion that if he has a lot of things, and things like toilet rolls and sanitizers [can be bought], and it is enough, then perhaps this fear can be reduced,"" said Russell Zimmerman."
Hu Gives a Crap, a manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, said on Wednesday that their stock would run out.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which manufactures the sorbents that make Cleanx toilet tissue and solaris paper, has insisted that they continue to work 24/7 to maintain supplies.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers were giving free toilet paper to the first bidder at an auction in Melbourne, some of which was due to be auctioned because buyers had a long weekend off on Labor Day.
In this Thursday's publication of NT News, printed every day in Darwin, an eight-page appendix is given to cut into pieces and is used as toilet paper.
A report from ABC Australia on March 3 said the stores were largely reluctant to impose restrictions, where they said they had no plans to impose restrictions on their purchases.
Russell Zimmerman also said that demand for other products is also very high, including masks, sanitizers, dry products, handwash and flour.
In the same way, the sale of paper used for the Andress toilet in online British supermarket Ocado was limited to two 12-roll packs every Sunday evening outside Australia.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — a pandemic.
"While the term ""epidemic"" does not refer to how dangerous certain cases are but to how widely any disease has spread, the World Health Organization noted the need for governments to take action:"
"""All countries can still change the course of this global pandemic."
"WHO Secretary-General Adnan Ghebreyesus said that if states can identify, ""check, treat, isolate, identify, and organize."
"""We are deeply concerned by both the alarming levels of disease spread and severity and the alarming levels of inactivity."""
"According to Dr. Tom Fryden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the global pandemic is ""unprecedented""."
"In a comment published on CNN in February, he said, ""Except for influenza, no other respiratory virus has been continuously tracked since the emergence of the time that the virus has spread around the world."""
"Gebrasus is of the same opinion, saying, ""We've never seen a coronavirus pandemic before."""
"He continued, ""And we've never seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."""
The new status as a global pandemic follows WHO's decision to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern in January.
"Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, said of the outbreak, ""In other words, the situation is going to get worse."""
The Associated Press reported on Thursday that the number of COVID-19 infections worldwide has risen to at least 126,000 resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which was declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, nearly 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been detected in 210 countries and union territories, resulting in nearly 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate in China is estimated at 4%, while the worldwide rate range ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
First aid is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering your face during coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and keeping yourself isolated for people who are suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by restricting travel, quarantine, curfews, risk control at work, and shutting down the facility.
The global pandemic has led to intense global socio-economic disruptions, cancellations of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and fear of shopping led to supply shortages.
Schools and universities are either nationally or locally closed across 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been cases of extermination and discrimination against other people in China, East and Southeast Asia, and others from areas where significant cases of the virus have been found, depending on their ancestry and appearance.
Due to the closure of travel and heavy industry, the levels of air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
Health authorities in Wuhan (the capital of Hubei province) in China reported on 31 December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia for unknown reasons, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market and therefore the virus is thought to have some animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronavirus, boron coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person who reported symptoms, was later reported to be ill on 1 December 2019; and the subsequent one had no visible connection to the Wet Market cluster.
The market was linked to two-thirds of the initial cluster of cases in December 2019.
An unverified report by the South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020 indicated that a case found on 17 November 2019 may have been the first among a 55-year-old man from Hubei province. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that new infections in China had reportedly decreased, but there was a sudden increase in the number of new cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and that the number of new cases outside China was the number of new cases for the first time.
The number of cases may be lower, especially in people with mild symptoms.
As of February 26, relatively few cases have been reported among young people, most of whom are under the age of 19 and 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the United Kingdom’s chief scientific adviser, estimates that 60% of the UK population needs to be infected before they can gain immunity.
According to the official protocol, cases are the number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, had formal policies not to test people with only mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that as of January 23, about 86% of cases of COVID-19 in China had not been detected and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79% of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the official count.
The initial estimate of the general reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it is likely 5.7.
Most of the people infected with COVID-19 have recovered.
In those who do not, the mortality interval from exacerbation of symptoms is 6 to 41 days, the most common of which is 14 days.
On April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths were said to be related to COVID-19.
As of February 5 in China, 80% of people over the age of 60 have died, and 75% of them have already had heart disease and diabetes. Official figures on COVID-19 usually indicate those who were infected by COVID as per customary rules.
The death toll may be much higher as a result of COVID-19, as it may not include people who die without testing - such as at home, nursing homes, etc.
Some partial data from Italy found that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic was 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death rate.
"A proponent of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged ""we know that [the reported death toll] is estimated to be lower than the actual number"", a statement that was echoed by reports that low-count data in the U.S. was not based on. Such depreciation often occurs in the case of a global pandemic, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic."
The first death outside mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1 and the first death outside Asia on February 14 in France.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths have been reported outside mainland China, including in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, deaths have been reported in more than forty countries and territories on all continents of the world, except Antarctica. Several methods are used to determine mortality.
These numbers vary by region, and are unaffected by demographic characteristics such as the amount of testing, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, the time it has been cut since the initial outbreak, and age, gender, and overall health. The proportion of deaths and infections shows the number of deaths within a given time frame divided by the number of cases diagnosed.
Based on figures from Johns Hopkins University, the global death toll and case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the mortality and case-to-case ratio has come down from 17.3% (those who showed symptoms between 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (those who had first symptoms since 1 February 2020). Other preventive measures include – Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease who have died, and the percentage of people who have died from the disease (R) who have been diagnosed.
These figures are not limited to any time and follow a specific population from infection through case analysis.
Many scholars have attempted to calculate these numbers for a specific population.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall mortality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The calculation above this range is consistent with a statistical study of the impact of testing on the first randomized test and CFR estimates of COVID-19 in Germany.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The maximum limit and final timeframe of the project are uncertain and may differ according to location.
"McBoni, from Penn State University, said, ""Being untested, infectious outbreaks usually dominate and then begin to degrade when the disease no longer has a host."
At this point, it is almost impossible to predict when it will happen.
"Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that if all countries could be brought together to follow the World Health Organization's advice to prevent the spread of the virus, ""it could end by June""."
"Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said on 17 March that SARS-CoV-2 ""will probably continue to spread for a year or two."""
"According to a study by Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, it is necessary to maintain physical distancing and other measures ""until a vaccine is available (probably for 18 months or more)."
"William Schefner of Vanderbilt University said, ""I think it's pretty unlikely that this coronavirus -- because it infects so quickly -- will disappear completely,"" and that it ""could become a seasonal disease, coming back every year""."
The intensity of the return will depend on the immunity of the animal and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and people who are infected may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include shortness of breath, loss of smell, loss of breath, shortness of breath, muscle and unstable joints, sore throat, headache, body chills, vomiting, coughing, coughing, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO reports that about one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, waking up and bluish appearance or lips as emergency symptoms; it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately if these symptoms are present. Further development of the disease may be due to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and sepsis.
Some of those infected may be asymptomatic without any clinical symptoms, but the test results confirm the infection, so the researchers have issued advice to monitor and test those who have come into contact with infected people to avoid infection.
Chinese estimates of asymptomatic proportions range from a few to 44%.
The range of the stage of general incubation (the period during which infection and symptoms begin) ranges from one day to 14 days; usually five days. In terms of uncertainty, the fraction of people with COVID-19 who initially lost their sense of smell is 30% and those who subsequently lost is 15%.
Some details on how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is thought that the disease is mainly transmitted by small droplets produced during close contact and when coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact refers to being between 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
The study found that water particles from an open cough can go from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some say the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets of fluid that remain in the air for long periods of time, including breathing saliva, although the virus is not usually airborne.
Water droplets can enter the mouth or nose of those who are nearby, or they can enter the lungs through inhalation.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause respiratory discharge to aerosolize and result in airborne transmission.
It can also spread when someone touches any contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there is concern that it may spread through feces, this risk is thought to be low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of oral infection with SARS-CoV-2, which is most contagious in the first three days after symptoms appear.
Many people have tested positive three days before the onset of these symptoms, which suggests that the disease can be transmitted before any significant symptoms appear.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but some countries have detected asymptomatic infections during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, but one person usually infects two to three people.
In particular, the virus was found in plastic (polypropylene) for three days, in 304 stainless steel, in cardboard one day and in copper for four hours.
This varies, depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, just as other surfaces touched by infected people have to do.
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel and novel virus with severe acute respiratory symptoms, was first isolated from three people with pneumonia in Wuhan, China.
All the properties of novel SARS-CoV-2 are found in all the related coronaviruses found in nature. Outside of the human body, this virus is killed by household soap as it breaks down the protective shell of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought to be a source of animal disease.
Genetic analysis suggests that the coronavirus is genetically synthesized from two bat strains in the subgenus sarbecovirus (Line B) with the genus Betacoronavirus.
The level of complete genome in other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) is 96% the same.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference between a virus in the wild and a virus in the human body in certain parts of the genome sequence.
Compared to the entire genome to date, it has been found that there is a similarity of 92% genetic material between the bonsai coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the bonsai acted as a host in the middle.
Infections can be diagnosed via viruses, depending on the symptoms temporarily, but ultimately confirm the reverse transmission of infected salivar polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan suggests that CT is significantly more sensitive, but less specific, than PCR, and that many of its photosynthesis properties coincide with other pneumonia and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used as a first-line test for COVID-19 diagnosis""."
The World Health Organization (WHO) has released several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was issued on January 17.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology.
The test can be done on a breath or blood sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
In general, this test is performed on top of a nasopharyngeal swab, but a sore throat swab may also be used. A few laboratories and companies are preparing serological tests that detect antibodies.
None of these as of 6 April 2020 have been proven to be accurate enough to be approved for far-reaching use.
The serological test, developed by Chelex in the United States, was approved to allow only authorized laboratories to be used in emergency situations.
Characteristic features of people with symptoms in radiographs and computed tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacity and absence of pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of images obtained from tests of confirmed cases.
Mixing with other infections such as adenovirus has been restricted by the PCR to form an image without any confirmation and to detect COVID-19.
A large study in China compared PCR to chest CT results and explained that, although the imaging of this infection is now less specific, it is faster and more sensitive which suggests it should be considered as an instrument for screening in epidemic-affected areas.
An artificial intelligence-based birth agency has been created that prepares the characteristics of the virus through radiographs and CTs.
Strategies to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining good personal hygiene, washing hands, not touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and sneezing or coughing into tissue and throwing that tissue into a garbage can.
Those who are already infected are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent infection. Many governments advised against or regulated all non-essential travel from countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has spread to large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in public and some people in public do not know where or how they got infected. It is recommended that health care providers use evidence alerts, contact alerts, and eye protection for anyone who may be infected. It is very important for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to find people in contact to prevent further infection.
The administration's use of mobile phone location information for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 organizations have issued statements calling for such surveillance to be limited.
Multiple mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert teams are working on a privacy-friendly solution, such as the use of Bluetooth to log in to another user's mobile phone.
Users will then receive a message if they come in contact with someone who is COVID-19 positive. There are a number of misconceptions surrounding how to prevent the infection, such as washing the nose and gargle with mouthwash.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many companies are working to create one.
Hand washing was recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people occasionally wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are apparently dirty; before eating; before brushing the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
Since the virus can be killed by household soap outside the human body, it breaks down the protective bubble of the virus.
The CDC recommends that when soap and water are not available by hand, at least 60% of alcohol-containing sanitizers can be used instead.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has advised people not to touch their eyes, nose or mouth with unclean hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with a few solutions (within a minute of contact with disinfectants in the case of stainless steel surfaces), which include 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5–odd povidone.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and clohexidine gluconate are relatively less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in a place such as an office or day care, the office, bathroom, common space, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATM machines used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with elbows or tissue paper when coughing or sneezing and immediately discard the tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who are at risk of infection. Wearing a mask can control the amount and extent of waterborne droplets that are released while talking, sneezing, or coughing.
The WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to wear a mask.
"According to Stephen Griffin, virologist at the University of Leeds, ""wearing a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene."""
The WHO has advised healthy people to wear a mask only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for a person with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to encourage people to wear face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing a non-medical mask made of cloth. China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when approaching other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong has advised wearing a surgical mask while on public transport or in crowded places.
Health officials in Thailand are encouraging people to make face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to wear a mask or cover the nose and mouth while going out.
On March 16, Vietnam urged everyone to wear a face mask while going to crowded places to protect themselves and others.
The Australian government has made it mandatory for everyone to wear a face mask when entering a grocery store.
Israel has asked all its citizens to wear masks when they go out.
Taiwan, which has been producing nearly one million masks per day since mid-March, will require passengers to wear face masks on trains and interstate buses for travel from April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask whenever you go out, and has advised those who cannot buy a face mask to wear a face mask.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes reducing close contact between people and controlling the spread of infection by slowing the spread of the disease.
Methods include staying in quarantine; limiting travel; closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shop-markets.
Individuals can apply the methods of social distancing from home, limiting travel, avoiding populated areas, greeting without touching, and maintaining physical distance from each other.
Many governments are now mandating or advising social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak of the disease.
The maximum size to be combined, as advised by U.S. government authorities and health institutions, fell sharply from 250 people (unless the area is known to have COVID-19) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
"On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and impaired immune systems were ""remaining at a distance"" with the aim of maintaining social distancing in ways that ""reduced the risk of severe illness and complications"" so that people with disabilities ""remaining at a distance"" could be avoided, and the CDC advised them to stay at home as much as possible in areas of the outbreaks in society."
"The use of the term ""social distancing"" has influenced the way in which social distancing has led to complete social isolation, rather than encouraging people to interact with others in alternative ways."
This includes only having sex with someone who lives with you, who does not have the virus or has no symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for those who are infected with COVID-19 and who suspect themselves to be infected.
Health agencies issue detailed guidelines for appropriate self-isolation. Many governments mandate or recommend self-quarantine for all residents living in the affected areas.
The strictest guidelines for self-quarantine have been issued for high-risk groups.
People who have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with a widespread infection are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of their last possible contact.
Any outbreak control strategies are containment or suppression measures and mitigation.
In the early stages of the outbreak, containment measures are put in place, and in addition to tracing and isolating infected people to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population, other measures to control the infection are aimed at initiating and vaccinating.
When it is no longer possible to sustain the spread of the disease, efforts go to the level of mitigation: some remedies are taken so that the speed of this spread can be somewhat reduced and its impact on the healthcare system and society can be minimized.
At the same time, both containment and mitigation may have to adopt a mixed standard.
Suppression needs to be taken to a greater extent to reduce the number of primary reproductions to less than 1 to reverse the cycle of epidemics. Reducing the maximum number of epidemics is part of the fight against the outbreak of an infectious disease, known as the flattening of the epidemic curve.
It reduces the risk of infection and provides more time for treatment and treatment.
Other ways in which the outbreak can be controlled other than medication include personal preventive measures, such as hand-washing hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine on the whole; stricter measures aimed at keeping physical distance, such as keeping schools closed and canceling public gatherings, and more restrictive measures aimed at preventing the spread of disease; such other ways are to engage the public in accepting and participating in the outbreak; also cleaner environmental measures, such as environmental measures.
Other countries have also adopted multiple standards to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea began mass testing and local self-quarantine, and issued a warning on the movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large-scale fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and increased fines for medical supplies fraud. The shaming of the efforts of Great Britain and the United States proves that mitigation (slowed down but not stopped the spread of the pandemic) and suppression (increased against the epidemic) pose a major challenge.
While the most ambitious mitigation policies have been able to reduce the highest demand for health care by two-thirds and deaths by half, health systems are still reeling as a result of hundreds of thousands of deaths.
Suppression may be the preferred method, but as long as the virus continues to circulate among the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it comes first), it is necessary to maintain it, as measures are relaxed otherwise the virus infection returns quickly.
Long-term interventions to suppress the epidemic lead to social and economic losses.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Consuming over-the-counter cold-cough medicine, drinking fluids, and rest can relieve symptoms.
Depending on how serious the illness is, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids (via the vein) and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can lead to worse results.
Several compounds approved for the treatment of other viral diseases in the past are being researched for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also stated that some "conventional and domestic remedies" can help alleviate the symptoms of SARS-CoV-19.
Increased capacity and the acquisition of health centers for COVID-19 patients has been described by the WHO as primarily preventive measures to prevent the outbreak of the disease.
The ECDC and the WHO's European Regional Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and first aid delivery centers that require multi-level sources to be removed and which include increasing laboratory attention to COVID-19 testing, increasing the number of intensive monitoring by isolating and keeping COVID-19 positive patients in isolation and training staff, and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available, etc.
There are several theories as to where the first case (the so-called Patient Zero) might have originated.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was detected on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei had gradually increased.
Most of these were related to the Huanan marine food wholesale market, where live animals were also sold, and according to one theory the virus came from one such animal; or, to put it another way, it has an animal source. A pneumonia cluster of unknown causes was observed on December 26 and doctor Zhang Jixian (Zhang Jixian) reported to the Hubei Provincial Hospital on December 27, who treated Wu on December 27.
"On 30 December, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a ""SARS-like coronavirus""."
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, I Fan, was reprimanded by his high-ranking staff for making threats.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and reported it to the World Health Organization.
In early January, several cases of unknown pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, which is under investigation. At the initial stage of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled almost every seven-and-a-half days.
In early and mid-2020, the virus spread to other parts of China with the help of Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transportation hub and major rail junction.
On January 20, China reported that about 140 new cases were found in a single day, including two people from Beijing and one from Shenzhen.
As of March 26, the United States has seen the highest number of confirmed cases in the world, surpassing China and Italy. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
There were at least one case of infection in about 200 countries and territories.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area restricted free movement and imposed border controls.
As of 2 April, approximately 300 million people, or 90% of the population, are in some kind of lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people are in lockdown in the Philippines, about 59 million people in South Africa and 1.3 billion people in India are in lockdown.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which rose to 2.6 billion two days later - nearly one-third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was found in Wuhan on December 1, 2019, but according to an unconfirmed report, a case was first detected on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jijian noticed a cluster of pneumonia on December 26 for an unknown reason, after which his hospital informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
The initial genetic examination of patient samples on December 27, 2019, indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notification.
It was reported on the same day.
"After the notifications were published, police were warning doctors in Wuhan to ""spread rumours"" about the outbreak."
"The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed there was no ""clear evidence"" of human-to-human transmission."
"In late January, the Chinese government launched a revolutionary campaign that was later described by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, as a ""people's war"" to control the spread of the virus."
"A cordon sanitiser was announced on 23 January, stopping travel to and from Wuhan, described as ""the largest quarantine in human history"", which was expanded to a total of 15 cities in Hubei and affected approximately 57 million people."
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) celebrations have been cancelled in many places.
The officials also announced the construction of a temporary hospital i.e. Huashanshanshan Hospital which was completed in 10 days.
After Leishenshan Hospital, another hospital was built to take care of additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China turned 14 other centers in Wuhan, such as the Convention Center and the Stadium, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took measures to take additional measures to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, including health declarations for tourists and the extension of the Spring Festival holiday.
Schools and universities across the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macao have taken various measures, especially with regard to schools and universities.
Work from a remote location was arranged in many areas of China.
There were restrictions on travel in and out of Hubei.
Government transport systems were changed across China, and museums were temporarily closed.
"Restrictions on public movement were imposed in many cities and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some form of restrictions on outdoor movement. After the outbreak entered the global stage in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from becoming ""imported"" from other countries."
For example, Beijing has declared it mandatory for all international travelers entering the city to isolate for 14 days. On March 23, five days before, only one case has been infected domestically on the mainland of China. It is found in one of the travelers returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of internally infected cases had been largely blocked and the outbreak in China had been controlled.
Two months after the lockdown was imposed, restrictions on travel to Hubei were eased on the same day, in addition to Wuhan. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on 26 March 2020 that entry permits for people holding visas or residence permits would be suspended from 28 March, and no specific details were given as to when this policy would end.
Those who want to enter China will have to apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30, and provided a package of financial incentives for companies. The State Council announced a day of mourning that began with a nationwide three-minute silence on April 4 at 10:00 a.m., also the day of the Qingming festival, although the central government asked families to pay tribute online to the lockdown while maintaining physical distancing to avoid a new outbreak of COVID-19.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread from China to South Korea on January 20, 2020.
The country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, mainly due to the Daegu's new religious movement known as the Jewish Shincheonji Church.
Visitors to the Shinchanji Church, who had come to visit Daegu from Wuhan, were suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
Of the 9,336 followers of the Church on February 22, 1,261, or about 13%, reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level of alert on February 23, 2020.
More than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea on February 28, which rose to 3,150 on February 29.
All military bases in South Korea were quarantined after three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
The airline's schedule was also affected and changed for that reason. South Korea launched a program to test the public for the virus and isolate infected people and trace and quarantine those they came in contact with, which is considered to be the world's largest and best-organized program.
Screening methods, such as self-reporting of new international arrivals by mobile apps, testing drive-through of the virus, which results the next day and testing 20,000 people per day, need to be ramped up.
Despite cities not fully quarantined, South Korea's program has been seen as a successful response to the outbreak. South Korean society was first polarized by President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have either signed the petition, claiming the outbreak was officially abused and calling for Moon's impeachment or praising his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest number of single-day cases in a total of four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that all new arrivals from abroad will be quarantined for two weeks starting April 1.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has accepted virus testing requests from 121 different countries.
Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on February 19 to Qom, where according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died the following day.
The initial restrictions announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events and sporting events, Friday prayers and the closure of schools, higher education institutions and universities.
Iran has allocated 5 trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that there were no plans to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and that only individual individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit travel between different cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic continued between the cities as the Persian New Year was ahead of Nowruz.
Shia religious places in Qom were open until 16 March 2020. Iran became the epicenter of the virus outbreak after China in February.
Amid claims that the level of the outbreak in Iran had been suppressed, more than ten countries found Iran as the source of their infection by February 28, indicating that the level of the outbreak was much higher than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to that date.
On March 3, 23 of the 290 members of Iran's parliament tested positive for the virus.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch appealed to Iran's prison authorities to unconditionally release the human rights violators detained for peaceful dissent and to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
It is said that confined institutions such as prisons are at greater risk of spreading the virus, which also lack proper medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number in the country since the outbreak began.
At least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials have died of the disease as of March 17.
On March 23, Iran reported 50 new cases per hour and a new death every 10 minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, Iran may have five times the number of cases reported.
It also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran might undermine the country's financial capacity to deal with the outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the lifting of economic sanctions on countries, including Iran, that have been hit hardest by the pandemic.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
Cases have started to rise more sharply, prompting the Italian government to stop all flights coming from China and declare a state of emergency in the country.
A cluster of unorganized COVID-19 cases was found in Lombardy on 21 February after 16 confirmed cases. On 22 February, the cabinet issued a new law regarding the outbreak, where, in northern Italy, more than 50,000 people were isolated from 11 different municipalities.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said that "the outbreak has shown that there will be no entry and exit routes to all places."
"The activities in those areas have already been disrupted and sporting events have been suspended. ""On March 4, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities at the national level since Italy's death toll reached 100."
Although all major sporting events, including football matches in Serie A, were scheduled to be held with restrictions until April, on March 9, all sports were completely suspended for at least a month.
On 11 March, the Prime Minister ordered the closure of almost all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies in Conte. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Anaesthesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published a medical policy advice on the Triage Protocol that may be employed.
On March 19, Italy reported 3,405 deaths from the pandemic, surpassing China as the country with the highest number of coronavirus deaths in the world.

As of April 5, 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 people have been reported in Italy, of which these cases are the highest seen in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicates that the combination of Italy's older population and the inability to test for the virus to date may be leading to higher mortality rates.
At first, the UK was the most relaxed of the countries affected by the virus, and as of 18 March 2020, the British administration has not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has had to face a lot of criticism for not realizing the magnitude and importance of the impact of the disease on people. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement that all non-essential travel, social gatherings are prohibited and he has advised everyone to work from home wherever possible and ordered pubs, restaurants and theaters to avoid.
On March 20, the government announced that all leisure establishments, such as pubs and gyms, must close as soon as possible and promised to pay up to <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 a month in wages for 80% of workers to prevent unemployment during this crisis. On March 23, the prime minister announced strict social distancing measures, banning gatherings of more than two people, and limiting travel and outdoor activities to only those deemed highly necessary.
Unlike previous measures, these controls were enforceable by the police, by issuing fines and removing gatherings.
"Most businesses, including supermarkets, drug stores, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations, and garages, were ordered to close, with only businesses considered ""essential"" being the exception."

On 28 January 2020, the Center for Disease Control, the main public health institution of the US administration, announced that they had prepared their own test kits.
Despite this, the United States has been testing at a very slow pace, which has kept the actual number of infections from smog during the outbreak of the disease.
The testing was hampered by faulty test kits produced by the state government in February and the lack of state government approval for private test kits (education centers, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and the regulatory qualifications that people had (since a doctor's order was required) to qualify for a test until early March.
By February 27, The Washington Post reported fewer than 4,000 tests in the United States.
By March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On March 22, the Associated Press issued a statement: "Many people who have a doctor's order and have symptoms have had to wait many hours or days for a test".

Ma also provided medical supplies to Canada, expressing doubts about masks and test kits made by the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and Czech Democratic Chinese.
For example, while Spain withdrew 58,000 China-made coronavirus testing kits with only a 30% accuracy rate, the Netherlands returned 600,000 Chinese face masks, which were defective.
Belgium had withdrawn 100,000 non-useable masks, which were thought to have come from China, but actually came from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese favours have been well received in Latin America and parts of Africa. On April 2, the World Bank adopted an emergency assistance scheme for developing countries.
The WHO appreciated the efforts of the Chinese authorities in controlling and managing the pandemic.
The WHO has noted the difference between the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of protecting privacy that impeded prevention and control efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government "provided regular updates to avoid panic before the Lunar New Year holiday".
"On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement the transportation ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Goden Galli commented that ""WHO has not made this recommendation since the outbreak of the epidemic was first declared in 2009, and it was ""a very important indication of the international commitment to suppressing the global epidemic in the place where its concentration was highest, after WHO called it an ""unprecedented increase in the history of public health"" (after the outbreak in other countries, on 30 January, the number of cases confirmed in people from outside China)."
"The WHO director general said that the reason for PHEIC was ""the higher risk of global spread in low- and middle-income countries where there is no advanced medical system."""
"In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros said that ""there is no reason for actions that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and business"" and also said that ""WHO does not recommend limiting business and movement."""

"Tedros also announced that ""we are as strong as the weakest source"" and urged the international community to ""invest today or pay more later"". The WHO introduced the name of the disease as COVID-19 at a press conference on 11 February."
"On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ""agreed to provide the strength of all UN mechanisms in response""."
"As a result, a UN crisis management team was activated, which allowed for the coordination of the response of the entire UN, which according to the WHO would ""allow them to focus on the health response, while other agencies could use their expertise to deal with the broader social, economic and developmental impacts of the outbreak."""
On February 14, WHO Tha led joint mission team is active with China to bring international and WHO expert teams to the Chinese mainland so that they can help with the domestic management of the coronavirus and that the "intensiveness and ability to transmit the disease" should be further evaluated by the WHO through meetings with various workshops and other major national institutions, and that the WHO should be able to travel to the appropriate locations "to assess the impact and response of activities at the provincial and county levels, including the city and rural systems".
"In response to the surge in outbreaks in Iran, the WHO sent a joint mission there to assess the situation. On 28 February, the WHO officially stated that the coronavirus threat assessment at the global level would be increased from ""over"" to ""extremely high"", which is its highest level of alert and risk assessment."
"Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Program, warned in a statement that ""this is a real test for every government on the planet: wake up."
"This virus may be around and you need to be prepared,"" said the report, adding that taking the right response can help the world avoid ""the worst form of it""."
"Ryan later said that the current data does not give public health officials the necessary evidence to declare it a global pandemic, and said that such an announcement would mean ""we must acknowledge that every person in this world will come into contact with the virus."""
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
"The managing director said that the WHO was ""deeply concerned about both the alarming spread and prevalence of the disease and the alarming level of its inactivity"", which has faced considerable criticism for inadequate measures to control the pandemic, including delaying public health emergency declarations and classifying the virus as a pandemic."
The negative response included a petition for the resignation of WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, which as of April 6 has been signed by 733,000 people.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts explained the importance of respecting the rights of every person during COVID-19.
The expert team said that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and the government is responsible for it.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance could never be an argument to discriminate against a particular group.
The experts emphasized that people with disabilities, members of minority groups, elderly people, internally displaced people, those living in very poor conditions, those who are prisoners, refugees and other marginalized groups in need of government assistance – all have the right to health care.
International government agencies are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to provide perspectives and advice.

A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were fired for their efforts to isolate people in the central China region, which clearly shows signs of discontent with political organizations over the spread of the disease in these regions.
Some critics believe that the move was taken to protect Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, from public anger over the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, whose theory of the COVID-19 conspiracy originated in the United States or Italy, denied an earlier confession about the outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan.
"Donald Trump's U.S. administration referred to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" or the ""Wuhan virus"", saying China's ""censorship has supercharged a virus that has now become a global pandemic"", which some critics have criticized as racism and ""an attempt to distract from the failure of his administration to prevent the disease""."
"The Daily Beast received a speech about the conduct of the United States government, which outlined a communication strategy with sources in the National Security Council, where the strategy was cited as ""everything China-related."""
"We are being told to try to spread this message by any means possible, including by holding press conferences and television appearances,"" said sources such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg, who claim that China's efforts to send aid to virus-stricken countries are part of a campaign to exert global influence."
"The head of European Union foreign policy, Josep Borrell, warned that there was a geopolitical component, including a struggle for ""story-making and influence through the politics of generosity""."
"Borrell added, ""China is aggressively pushing the message that unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."""

"This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity."""
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the Russian army to send military medics, special disinfectant vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
"An unnamed ""high-level political source"" quoted in the Italian newspaper La Stampa stated that 80 percent of Russian aid was ""flawless or barely usable for Italy""."
"The source blamed Russia for landing on a campaign to please ""geographically and diplomatically""."
Lombardy's President Attilio Fontana and Italy's Foreign Minister Luigi de Maio rejected the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that ""when it comes to helping U.S. colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when U.S. medical equipment manufacturers get some momentum, they can also pay back."""
"The planned NATO ""Defender 2020"" military exercises in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, which are NATO's largest combat exercises since the end of the Cold War, will be held at reduced levels."
"The former Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, the current Secretary-General of the Republic of Iran, criticized the exercise, saying: ""In the current public health crisis, where the government is in danger, it will not only endanger the lives of the forces of the United States and many other European countries, but also the lives of the participating countries."
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, where he said that the fight against the outbreak is becoming harder for them as the United States continues to impose sanctions on Iran because of its lack of access to the international market. The outbreak has led to calls for universal health care, universal child care, higher paid family leave and higher public health than other countries in the United States.
Political analysts speculated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of being re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated during the global pandemic.
"After Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at a government-specified location, South Korea criticized Japan's ""unexplained and inert quarantine efforts""."
South Korean society was initially at two opposite poles about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many signed petitions calling for the dismissal of the Korean Moon, claiming the outbreak was mismanaged by the government, while many signed petitions praising his response. The global pandemic has given many countries the opportunity to enact emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this may allow the government to further tighten their grip on power.
In Hungary, its parliament gives Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n the right to rule indefinitely by issuing decrees, suspending parliament or running the election process, and punishing respectable people who spread misinformation about how the disease is transmitted and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for supply shortages, increased global use of materials needed to fight the pandemic, panic, and disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Shopping was also seen in many areas due to panic, as people bought more essential grocery items such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, due to which there was a shortage in the ghetto.
The technology industry in particular has warned about the delay in sending electric products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has increased the price by 20 times the normal price and caused a six-month delay in the supply of medical supplies.
It created a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and the WHO warned it would put health workers in danger.
In Australia, the pandemic gave Daigou sellers a new opportunity to sell Australian goods in China.
The activity resulted in a baby formula shortage in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, the oversupply of food products ensured, both areas were able to keep themselves free from severe food shortages.
China and Italy's measures against hoarding and illicit trade in essential goods have been successful, avoiding a severe shortage of food that was anticipated in North America without Europe.
Although there is no significant decline in agricultural products in northern Italy, according to industry representatives, prices may rise.
When Chinese government officials gave up stockpiling pork to provide adequate nutrition to the people, even in the city of Wuhan, they initially faced blank food shelves.
Italy has a similar national law that asks food producers to stock up on food for such emergencies.
The damage to the world economy was also felt in China: According to a March 16 media report, China's economy suffered a very strong blow in the first two months of 2020 due to the government's measures to reduce the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As China's mainland plays a key role in the economy and production, the outbreak of the virus threatens to create a major destabilizing situation for the world economy.
The Economist Intelligence Unit's Agathe Demarais predicts that markets will remain volatile until a more clear picture is released on the possible outcome.
In January 2020, some analysts speculated that the economic downturn caused by the pandemic in global growth could surpass the SARS outbreak of 2002–2004.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimates that the world's supply chain has suffered more than $300 billion in losses that could last up to two years.
"The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to have ""kneaded"" after oil prices fell sharply due to low demand from China."
The global stock market fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, posted their sharpest fall since 2008, with Dow taking 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007–08.
All three indexes are up more than 10% at the end of the week.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The stock market fell again in fear of the corona virus. The biggest fall can be seen on March 16.
Many are considering the possibility of a recession.
Economist Muhammad El-Arian praised the central bank and the state's timely emergency measures.
Central banks are coping faster than they did in the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected departments due to the government's ban on tourism, all populated places including attractive tourist areas, and the ban on any kind of travel around the world.
As a result, a number of airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, cancelled flights for relatively low demand, as the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the tourism industry has never been seen before.
Many train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The main season of travel to China, called Chunyuan, began during the Chinese New Year holiday, at which time the epidemic began in China.
Many events where there may be a lot of public gatherings, such as the annual New Year's Eve, have been closed by national and regional governments. Private companies are also closing their shops on their own, and various tourist attractions such as Hong Kong's Disneyland and Shanghai's Disneyland have closed.
Many Lunar New Year festivals and tourist gatherings, including the Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs in Beijing, have been closed to prevent public gatherings.
Officials in 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions have extended New Year's holidays until February 10, and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised the level of its infectious disease response to the maximum and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March and canceled New Year’s Eve celebrations. Global retail sales have been affected by reduced opening hours or temporary closures.
Sales in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East have seen a 50-60% decline.
As a result, the number of buyers in shopping centers decreased by 33–43% in March compared to February.
Shopping mall managers around the world imposed additional measures, such as increasing healthcare, installing thermal scanners to check buyers’ temperatures, and canceling events. According to estimates from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession triggered by the global pandemic could put 14 to 22 million more people into extreme poverty than would have been the situation if it had not been for the global pandemic in Latin America.
About 5 million people in China lost their jobs in the final stages of the pandemic in Wuhan in January and February 2020.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million rural migrant workers are stranded at home in inland regions or stuck in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
As per the calculations made by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 47 million people in the United States could lose their jobs due to the coronavirus outbreak and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. The lockdown in India has resulted in the unemployment of millions of Indian migrant workers (about 90,000 workers who lose their wages/wages per day on March 2020).
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British employees applied for a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have sent their employees to a government-subsidized short-term work plan known as Kurtzerbeit.
The German short-term work compensation scheme has also been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by this pandemic which has affected the activities of companies as well as individuals - both job seekers and individuals - globally.
Organizations in the arts and culture sector tried to maintain their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage in the community, to maintain the safety of their employees and people, and to support artists wherever possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, theaters, and other cultural institutions around the world had either cancelled or delayed their exhibitions, events, and performances.
In response, there was a concerted effort to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapidly growing consequence of this disease is the cancellation of religious services, major events in sports and music festivals and other social events such as concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The last week of the Christian Lent season, the Holy Week celebrated in Rome, was cancelled by the Vatican.
Many dioceses have advised older Christians to stay home rather than come on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, online live streaming, or television, while others are organizing worship without getting out of the car.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and the Christian pilgrimage to St. Peter's Square empty, other religious congregations also cancelled services and limited public gatherings at churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurudwaras.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak, and religious sites were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims as well as residents of the country from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic is the most significant disaster on the global sporting calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season have either been cancelled or postponed.
"The outbreak has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would ""rescheduled to no date after 2020 but not later than the summer of 2021""."
Reports of a significant increase in new sign-ups to gambling sites suggest that this has resulted in many gamblers moving online. In order to postpone or cancel various music group Jalsa tours, the entertainment industry has also been affected.
Many major theaters, such as those on Broadway, have suspended all performances.
"Some artists continued to compose and share art via the Internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as live streaming of concerts or creating web-based ""festivals"" so that artists could perform, distribute, and promote their work."
Online, Agnithi has spread the theme of coronavirus in the internet meme, which is very funny and also removes the attention from this time of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice against Chinese and East Asian descent, and also against people in hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries, and indifference towards foreigners, and racism.
In many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, there have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility.
Reports of cases since February have documented racist attitudes on various groups of Chinese people around the world, where they deserve the virus or what is being done to them is claimed as fair retribution.
There has also been an increase in anti-China sentiment in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on regional etymology.
There was support for the Chinese both online and offline, and support for the people in the virus-affected areas.
Italians, who have experienced the horror of the COVID-19 outbreak as the first country in Europe to progress to the new hotspot countries, may be skeptical and outspoken. Citizens from countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions/appeals to lobby for a ban on Chinese people entering their countries in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, this hash tag was very popular in <0x23>ChineseRajasthan.
In addition to the racist abuse of Chinese in the UK and the US as well as other Asians, the level of attacks is reported to be increasing.
"US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"", as critics see the phrase as racist and anti-Chinese."
Ukrainian protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and returning passengers from Wuhan to Nabi Sanjahari.
Students from northeast India, which shares a border with China, who are studying in India's major cities have reportedly been subjected to harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
"Dilip Ghosh, the president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's West Bengal state unit, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and ""that's why God took revenge against them."""
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata strongly criticized the remarks in Kolkata, calling them "misleading", adding that xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents in China have increased during the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "foreign garbage" and being identified as "draining".
There are a few other newspapers, including Paywall, that have removed them from their partial or full coronavirus coverage.
Many specific publications have created science-related essays that are available in open access.
Some scientists prefer to publish their results quickly on some innovative servers, such as Biorex.

Laboratory tests for the respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and the antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
The test is specific and designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and surveillance of people.
Antibody tests show how many people had the disease, including those who were too insignificant to report symptoms or who were asymptomatic.
From the results of this test, an accurate mortality rate of the disease and the group immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the outbreak of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of their population, and there are huge variations in how many tests have been carried out across different countries.
This difference will likely significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
With nasopharyngeal swabs or spit samples, respiratory samples obtained through various methods can be tested using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test performed with the throat swab is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
The virus may disappear from the throat at a later time, but the number of lungs may continue to increase.
In the case of infected people tested in the second week, otherwise the sample material can be taken from the depth of the trachea by suction catheter, or the object (sputum) emitted with the cough can be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was prepared in January 2020 in Charit<0xC3><0xA9>, Berlin, using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and it formed the basis of 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test by 23 January 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-stage SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
"This is to find out the common ""E"" gene within all beta coronaviruses and the RdRP gene characteristic of SARS-CoV-2. The BGI Group was one of the first companies to be granted emergency use authorisation for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit from China's National Medical Products Administration during the coronavirus pandemic in 2019.
Unsolved results due to faulty reagents in one of the three genetic tests of older versions of test kits and a blockage of testing in the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in less than 100 samples being successfully processed on average per day throughout February 2020.
The tests conducted using the two components were not determined to be reliable until 28 February 2020, and state and local laboratories were not allowed to begin testing until then.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. U.S. business labs began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 testing on a nationwide RT-PCR basis.
Quest Diagnostics similarly made available a nationwide COVID-19 test on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been announced; sample collection and processing must be performed as required by the CDC.
The COVID-19 test in Russia was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. On 12 March 2020, reports were received that Mayo Clinic had prepared a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could have been performed in a maximum of 3.5 hours, thus allowing a 24-hour period of testing to be performed over a 12-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a trial on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar approval to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid received an EUA from the FDA for a test, which took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a periodic temperature cycle, this method can give positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in as little as 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 of these devices in the US and Abbott hopes to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. One test uses a monoclonal antibody, which binds specifically to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus, and in 15 to 20 minutes it can give results, just like a rapid influenza test. This test is being prepared in Taiwan with the hope that it can be done.
"A literature review in March 2020 concluded that ""the importance of chest radiographs in early stages is very low in diagnosis, but data from CT [computed tomography] may even have its presence before the onset of symptoms."""
The features of CT include bidirectional, multilobar ground-glass opacification with an edge, asymmetric and backward distribution.
With the onset of the disease, subpleural domains, crazy paving and consolidation appear.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan, the epicentre of the current pandemic, suggests that CT is significantly more sensitive, but less specific, than PCR, and that many of its photosynthesis properties are combined with other pneumonia and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used as a first-line test for COVID-19 screening or for diagnostics""."
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect infections in humans starting 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and to monitor the population. Evaluations can be carried out by central laboratories (CLTs) and by point-of-care testing (POCTs).
Automatic systems with high efficiency in many essential laboratories will be able to perform this assay, but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system.
A single blood sample is commonly used for CLT, although sequential samples can also be used to follow an immune response.
In general, a single sample of blood is taken by perforating the skin for PoCT.
On March 26, 2020, the FDA announced the names of 29 companies that provided the agency with notifications as needed and now they are therefore able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved under an emergency use authorization by the FDA. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which could detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The capacity of the test is hundreds of samples in a few hours, and therefore much faster than a traditional PCR assessment of viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the UK found that any antibody test kits they purchased were not good enough to use.
"Hong Kong has developed a plan where suspected patients can stay at home, ""the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube"", he will spit in the sample, send it back to the patient, and he will get a test result shortly after the test. The British NHS has announced that they are rolling out a plan to test for suspected cases on a trial basis, which eliminates the risk of other people getting infected by the patient if the patient goes to a hospital."
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea conduct the fastest, most comprehensive testing of any country. The National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians in Germany said on March 2 that they have a capacity to test about 12,000 people per day in a mobile setting and 10.700 people were tested in the previous week.
When the test is ordered by a physician, health insurance costs are borne.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, drive-in tests were administered in many major cities.
The total number of tests completed in Germany on 26 March 2020 was unknown, as only positive cases were reported.
"A first lab study revealed that as of the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested positive for Ebola as of 12/2020 and included, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 in one of the tests ""on a single day"". In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital had only tested the samples in February, and developed a method to test the samples together from 64 patients."
The oversight of the construction work by BGI founder Wang Xian and the modeling of it being done in 5 days showed that if the testing capacity had not been increased in time, the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost of tackling the quarantine would have doubled.
Huo-Yan Labs quickly followed Wuhan Laboratory in a total of 12 cities across China, such as Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
By 4 March 2020 the testing capacity was a total of 50,000 per day. Open source, multiplexed designs published by Origami Assays revealed that using only 93 tests, a maximum of 1122 patients could test samples for COVID19. These balanced designs could be run in small laboratories without the need for a robotic liquid handler.
By March, the lack of reagents and insufficient doses had become a limitation in mass testing in the European Union and the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some researchers to explore sample preparation protocols where samples were heated for 5 minutes at 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the UAE was now testing more people for the coronavirus than any other country and was on track to increase the testing level to reach the majority of the population.
"This was done through a combination of drive-through capability and a population-scale laboratory purchase from Group 42 and BGI (based on their ""Huo-Yan"" emergency detection laboratories in China)."
The lab, built in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands of times more RT-PCR tests per day and is the first lab in the world to operate outside China.
Different test methods were developed targeting different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The German system of producing kits was adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) for low-income countries that do not have the resources to make their own kits.
The German system was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol, prepared by the United States Centers for Disease Control, was not available until 28 January, which delayed tests available in the U.S. There was a problem between China and the U.S. regarding the reliability of testing kits early in the outbreak of the disease, and the inability of these countries and Australia to supply enough testing to meet the demand and what health experts recommend.
In contrast, experts say that more testing in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of the coronavirus.
The South Korean administration has developed the ability to test mainly in private-sector labs over the years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to slow the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus created tens of millions of test pending work in private U.S. labs, and pressured supplies of swabs and chemical reagents.
In March 2020, China reported problems with accuracy in their test kits.
"The test kits produced by the CDC in the United States contained ""errors""; the administration then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain bought the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasay Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were incorrect."
The company explained that incorrect results could result in failure to collect samples or to use the kits properly.
The Spanish Ministry said that they would withdraw the kits given the wrong results, and replace them with a different kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasay. The Czech Republic gave 80% of the test kits that were purchased from China with the wrong results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that were found to be inaccurate.
"Prime Minister Matovic proposed to dump them into the Danube River. Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey had purchased from China had ""a high rate of error"" and that they ""did not use them." The UK had purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but announced that they were usable as early as April 2020."
Positive results were obtained by testing and then quarantining those who tested positive and finding people who had contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive people.
In Italy, the place of the first death from COVID-19, researchers working in the Italian city of Vo conducted two rounds of testing in a span of about ten days over a full population of 3,400 people.
Nearly half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms and all identified people were placed in quarantine.
Controlling traffic in the community has completely eliminated new infections.
Through aggressive detection of people coming into contact, inbound travel control, testing and quarantine, but without any extreme controls such as forced closures of restaurants and retail outlets, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much slower than in other developed countries.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened in time after a holiday break on March 23.
Several other countries have also aggressively sought to find people in contact, through inbound travel control, testing and quarantine, but with less invasive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that the mortality rates were much lower in countries that tested more than the number of deaths, as these countries were likely able to detect patients with mild or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to test and national laboratories have limited experience regarding COVID-19, should send the first five positive and the first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for testing confirming.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
"The ""What percentage of tests positive"" column on the following chart is influenced by the test policy of that country."
In a country where only hospitalized people are tested, the positivity rate will be higher than in a country where everything else is the same, whether people show symptoms or not, all citizens are tested.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, refers to the act of washing a person's hands for the purpose of removing soil, grease, microscopic organisms, or other unwanted substances.
"Hand washing with soap regularly during certain ""critical moments"" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the way to the feces - the mouthpiece."
People may also have respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five most important moments of the day when washing hands with soap are: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby’s lower back, or changing nappies, before feeding the baby, before eating and preparing food, or before and after handing out raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be washed with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing the diapers or cleaning the child who has used the toilet.
after coughing, sneezing or wheezing.
After touching animal, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to healthy habits related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before taking medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to keep the hands clean from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that are harmful or cause disease.
This is especially important for people who care or work in the medical field, but it is also an important procedure for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the transmission of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
Reducing the infant mortality rate at home.
A 2013 study found that the improved habit of hand washing can lead to shorter improvements in the length of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of children with respiratory and diarrhoea-related diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes such as washing hands with soap.
This simple process can reduce the mortality rate from this disease by about 50%.
The measures taken to encourage hand washing can reduce diarrheal episodes by about a third, and this is comparable to clean water supply in low-income areas.
Hand washing with soap has been linked to a 48% reduction in diarrhea cases. Hand washing with soap is the only most effective and affordable way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI) is performed as an automatic practice in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, which is a major ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under the age of five. It takes the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children each year.
Pneumonia and diarrhoea are the leading causes of the death of 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, changing the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than a single vaccine or medical intervention, reducing diarrhea deaths by nearly half, and reducing deaths from acute respiratory infections by one-quarter.
Hand washing is integrated with other sanitation systems as part of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing protects against infectious dermatitis (impetigo), which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A little harmful effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to dryness of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itching, skin peeling conditions known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Excessive hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Five important times of the day when it is important to wash hands with soap are: after using the bathroom (urination, defecation), after cleaning the baby’s lower back or changing nappies, before feeding the baby, before eating and before preparing food or handing over raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when appropriate hand washing techniques should be applied to prevent disease transmission include cutting or wounding before and after treatment; sneezing, coughing, or wheezing; after touching animal waste or moving animal; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is very rare.
A study in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households are accustomed to hand washing with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of hand washing at 97 percent; the United States had the lowest rate of development at about 77 percent; and China had the lowest rate of 23 percent. There are now several habit changes in the country’s habit of hand washing to increase the habit of hand washing with soap in times of crisis. There are several practice changes to make the children practice of hand washing deeper.
"The ""Essential Health Care Program"", implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines, is an example of taking adequate measures to promote children's health and education."
The main purpose of this program is to demineralize twice a year, as well as washing hands with soap every day, brushing teeth daily with fluoride.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is increased by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main function of soap and detergent is to reduce the resistance of the solution and increase the solubility.
Only water is ineffective skin cleanser (skin cleanser) because fat and protein, which are organic soil elements, do not dissolve easily in water.
Cleaning is done with the help of a moderate water flow.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can retain bacteria derived from previous use.
A small number of studies that aimed at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps concluded that the transfer was less likely because the bacteria were washed away with foam.
"The CDC still states that ""it is recommended to apply a liquid soap that can be controlled without using hands""."
There has been a lot of publicity to the health-conscious public about antibacterial soaps.
To date, no evidence of the use of antibiotics or disinfectants recommended for nature-resistant organisms has been found.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial ingredients such as triclosan, which have the ability to prevent excessive levels of organism.
Thus, while antibiotic-resistant strains are not chosen for antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are marketed to.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protecting ingredients, the sophisticated preparations also have a pH regulator for the removal of common fatty acids such as fatty acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), antimicrobialally active benzoic acid and an excess skin conditioner (alluvres, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts) that have been used to treat acne.
Hot water is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow very quickly at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, hot soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water to remove the natural oils that hold up the soil and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A non-water-based hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic that is a non-water-based hand-washing material.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcohol rub began to gain popularity with hand hygiene ingredients (also known as alcohol-based rub, antiseptic hand rub, or hand sanitizer).
In order to reduce the ease of use and the drying effect of alcohol, most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol produced together with carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) or humectants such as glycerin in liquids or foams.
Adding mixed hydrogen-peroxide further enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers contain a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol which is efficient at killing germs.
Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multidrug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccineia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizer contains 70% alcohol which kills 99.97% (equivalent to 3.5 log reduction, 35 decibels reduction) after 30 seconds of application on hand and kills 99.99% to 99.99% (4 to 5 log reduction) bacteria after 1 minute of application on hand. Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and relatively few viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. They are almost completely ineffective against the Norovirus (or Norwalk) type of virus. Sufficient hand antiseptics or alcohol rubs should be used to thoroughly moisten or smoothen the two hands.
As long as the liquid, foam, or gel is drying, both the front and back of the hands and the middle of the fingers, and the end edge is rubbed for about 30 seconds.
Finger tips that rub with the palms of two hands also need to be washed very well. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands well with hand sanitizer rub, especially if there is dirt on the hands.
The increasing use of these components depends on their ease of use and the rapid destruction of microscopic organisms; however, they should not be used as a proper hand wash replacement if soap and water are unavailable.
If the formula does not contain emulsifiers and/or skin moisturizers attached, frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers may cause dry skin.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other lotions to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with softer ingredients caused significantly less tension and dryness on the skin than soap or disinfectant detergents.
Hypersensitivity to alcohol hand rub rarely occurs for allergic skin diseases, contact disorders, or associated substances present in alcohol or alcohol.
Compared to hand washing with soap and water, the lower tendency to initiate painful touching dermatitis became an attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, the water-less material does not clean the organic matter of the hands, but only disinfects the hands.
Since pathogens still remain in the hands, effective hand sanitizers such as soap and water are not as effective at preventing the spread of many pathogens.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends largely on the ingredients and preparation, and in the past, alcohol and alcohol have worked significantly less than rubber.
More recently, benzalkonium chloride has been shown to maintain steady and progressive antimicrobial activity after user preparation application that is not similar to alcohol, which has likely seen a decrease in effectiveness after repeated use due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
In a low-income society, many people do not have the money to spend on soap and instead use ash or soil.
The ash or soil may be more effective than just water, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase rather than reduce the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution in contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap.
The correct hand washing techniques recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for Prevention include the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold running water.
Water is recommended because the permanent basin may be contaminated, but the temperature of the water does not seem to make any difference.
Wash your hands with plenty of soap at the back of your hand, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies have shown that people wash their hands better when they use soap instead of just water.
Stir for at least 20 seconds.
There is friction during scrubbing (absorbing) which removes germs from the skin and more germs are removed when rubbed for a long time.
Wash well with water.
Washing hands in the sink can be re-contaminated.
Dry it with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands are more easily re-contaminated. The places that are most excluded are the space between the fingers, wrists, fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can provide shelter to microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended so that the hands do not become dry; dry skin can damage the skin which can increase the risk of spreading infection.
"In developing countries where tap tap water and/or soap are not available, various low-cost options can be created to facilitate hand washing, for example by pouring water from hanging jars or appropriate holes and/or using ash if necessary. In limited water supply situations (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are other low-cost water-saving options such as ""TP-Tap"" and ""TP-Tap""."
Tippi-tap is a simple technology in which a jug of water rolled by a rope and a foot-operated lever and a piece of soap are used to pour a small amount of water into the hands.
Hand washing is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is little debate about the most effective type of drying in public washrooms.
A growing amount of research indicates that paper towels are much healthier than the electric hand dryers seen in many washrooms.
The paper towel industry was produced by the European Tissue Symposium in 2008 and conducted a study by the University of Westminster in London to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, warm-air hand dryers and more modern jet-air hand dryers.
After hand washing and drying with a warm-air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased by 194% on the finger and 254% on the palm of the hand.
Drying with a jet-air dryer increased the total number of bacteria by an average of 42% on the finger and 15% on the palm of the hand.
After hand-washing with paper towels, the total bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the fingers and 77% on the palms. The scientists also conducted experiments to prove whether there was a possibility of cross-contamination, as a result of each type of drying method, of contamination from the location of other washroom users and the washroom environment.
The jet-air dryer, which extracts air at a sustained speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow microorganisms out of the hands and units and remove up to 2 meters of potential pollution to washroom users and the washroom environment.
The use of a warm-air hand dryer disperses microscopic organisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towel showed no significant spread of micro-organisms. A study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt in 2005 evaluated various hand drying methods.
The following changes have been observed in the number of bacteria after hand drying:
Many different types of hand dryer manufacturers exist, and hand dryers have been compared with drying with paper towels.
Using hand sanitising wipes due to lack of soap and water is an option when traveling.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory in the hospital environment long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered the efficacy of hand washing in 1846.
There are some electronic devices that give feedback to hospital staff to remind them to forget to wash their hands.
A study has shown a decrease in the rate of infection when using them.
Medical hand-washing is done using enough soap and water or gel for a minimum of 15 seconds and to rub each part of the hand.
Your hands should be tied together.
If there is dirt under the nails, a bristle brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can be in the hands of water, it is important to thoroughly remove the foam and wipe it with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to turn off the water faucet (and open another door to drain if necessary).
This prevents contamination of the hands from those surfaces.
"The purpose of hand washing in a healthcare environment is to remove pathogens (""microbes"") and prevent their transmission."
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that in most medical environments, hand washing shortages remain at unacceptable levels, with a large number of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before they touch patients, thus causing microbe infections.
One study found that proper hand-washing and other simple methods could reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published the standard hand-washing and hand-absorbing chart in the Department of Health Care.
Draft guidelines on hand hygiene by the organization for public comments can also be found on its website.
A relevant review was conducted by Whitby and others.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene if regulatory follow-up verification is required.
"The World Health Organization has ""Five Moments"" for hand washing:"
After contact with blood or body fluids
Prior to the release of the vaccine, and
"After the patient is cared for. The antiseptic chemical addition to the soap (""medicinated"" or ""antimicrobial"" soap) provides the ability to destroy the hand wash element."
Before surgery or in places where there is an outbreak of antibiotic-resistant organisms, the removal may be intended. It is important to have a call to 'scrab' your hands for surgical work that can be turned on and off without touching your hands, emergency braking devices for some chlorhexidine or iodine, disinfection of the bottom of the washing machine for hand drying after washing, and disinfection of other towels and scrubs.
All doors must be opened.
This procedure usually requires 2-6 minutes to wash hands and elbows.
It is not necessary to rub hands for a long time (10 minutes).
During washing, the water from the wrist to the elbow must be prevented from rolling back towards the palm of the hand.
After washing the hands, the hands are dried with a disinfectant cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands before and after attending to a sick person or use hand antiseptics.
For the control of staphylococcus infection in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand-washing came from the first 20% washing, and when the repetition of hand washing was increased above 35%, the additional benefit was found to be very little.
Washing with ordinary soap with antibacterial soap results in three times the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to the food. By comparing hand-absorbing with alcohol-based solution with hand washing with antibacterial soap for a period of 30 seconds each showed that 26% reduction in alcohol-based pollution caused hand-absorbing more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water/water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile germs in the hands. Hand washing may involve the education of staff and written and oral reminders of staff regarding the availability of hand rubs to improve hand hygiene in healthcare environments.
More research is needed on which of these improvements is most effective in different healthcare environments.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as an affordable, vital way to achieve good health, even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing practices.
For example, most areas of rural Africa have cheaper options for creating hand washing spaces, but there is hardly a hand wash call near every private or public toilet.
However, the low hand washing rate can certainly be due to deeply ingrained habits rather than a lack of soap or water/water.
The promotion and advice of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to a change in people's long-term habits.
In order for it to work efficiently, it is necessary to observe and evaluate.
"A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based methods at LMICs are effective in hand washing, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of a campaign about hand washing in schools is UNICEF's ""Three Star Approach"" that encourages schools to take simple, affordable steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other healthy requirements."
If the minimum value is achieved, schools can reach three stars from one end to the other.
Setting up hand washing stations can be a part of the hand washing campaign that is run to reduce the disease and child mortality rates.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaigns that are attempting to change habits. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the recognition of hand washing emojis.
A number of studies have considered the overall cost savings of hand washing in developing countries on preventing DALYs.
However, one review suggests that the promotion of hand washing with soap is relatively more cost-effective than other water/water and sanitation systems.
"The importance of hand washing for human health – especially for people in vulnerable situations, such as mothers in hospitals who have barely given birth or wounded soldiers – was first recognized by two pioneers of hand hygiene in the mid-19th century: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, founder of ""Modern Nursing""."
Until that time, most people believed that the infection was caused by a foul smell called measmus.
In the 1980s, foodborne disease outbreaks and health care-related infections led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, has raised awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
"For example, in Germany, posters with ""correct hand washing techniques"" were hung in public toilets and next to hand washing sinks in office buildings and airport toilets."
"Such a phrase ""to shake hands"" means to take responsibility for the matter or to express the person's unwillingness to be a partner in wrongdoing."
It originates from the biblical portion of Matthew where Pontius Pilate disavowed the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a language of expression by more widespread use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands in an attempt to clean up the insanely fictitious stains by exposing her guilt feelings about the crime she had committed and the instigation of her husband.
It has also been found that people, when they think of or think of immoral work, are much more prone to hand washing than others and tend to pay more for hand washing equipment.
"Furthermore, those who have been allowed to wash their hands after such intent are less likely to engage in other ""cleaning"" compensatory activities, such as volunteering."
Religions dictate hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water/water for hand washing but not soap, is a part of religious practice characterized in many religions, including Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD> religion, Hinduism, Judaism, Tevilah and Netil<0xC3><0xA1>t Yadaim, Christianity's Loveabo and Islam's Ozu.
It is mandatory to wash hands after using the toilet in Hinduism, Judaism and Islam.
And, washing hands before and after every meal is mandatory in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam.
The risks of working in the workplace due to COVID-19
Workplace risk controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational safety and health procedures to risk control to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate risk controls in the workplace depend on the place of work and the work to be done, based on a risk assessment of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in public, and the risk factors for individual workers who may be at risk of contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations involve minimal professional contact with people and other colleagues, which includes hand washing, general infection prevention measures, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, respiratory etiquette, and regular cleaning of work environments.
Those at moderate risk of exposure include jobs where COVID-19 is not known or suspected to be present, but where frequent or close contact is required with people who may have been infected due to the ongoing disease spreading in the public at a business location or due to international travel.
This includes workers who have contact with the public, such as in schools, in high-density work environments, and in some overcrowded retail spaces.
In addition to the primary infection prevention measures, the risk control measures for this group include ventilation, sneeze guards and keeping personal protective equipment available when exposed to a person infected with COVID-19 using an improved capacity air filter.
The OSHA considers the risk of health workers and morgue workers coming into contact with people who are confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19. The risk increases if these workers apply an aerosol-derived process or collect samples of people who are suspected or suspected to have COVID-19 through this process.
Suitable risk controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative-pressured air circulation chambers, and personal protective equipment suitable for job work.
The spread of COVID-19 can have many effects in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work due to falling ill, having to take care of others, or for fear of possible exposure.
There is a demand for products and the way to buy these products (e.g. through shopping or delivery or drive-through services (not getting out of the car), can vary from both sides.
Finally, sending things from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be hampered. An infectious disease preparedness and response plan may be used to instruct protective measures.
Plans address the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and workplaces, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the home and community, and personal risk factors for employees such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also outlined the necessary controls to address those risks and plans to be prepared for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak of the disease.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
The objectives of the response to the outbreak include reducing transmission among workers, protecting people at risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and reducing the adverse impact on other companies in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the responses received.
The degree of danger control is a structure that is widely used in occupational safety and health performance control.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering control, then administrative control, and finally personal safety equipment.
Engineering controls involve separating employees from work-related risks without relying on employee behavior, and may be the most cost-effective solution for implementing it.
Administrative controls are changes in work-related policies or procedures that require action by the employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering and administrative control, but it can help prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE should be selected on the basis of the risk to the worker, as appropriate (e.g., the respirator), must be properly fitted, continuously and properly worn, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced, and properly opened, cleaned and stored or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), there is minimal professional contact with the public and other colleagues at low risk of exposure.
The basic measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and well-washing of hands, encouraging workers to stay at home when they are sick, providing respiratory etiquettes, tissues and garbage disposals, keeping the mouth covered during sneezes and coughing, telecommunication or cleaning of the workplace and preparing for staggered shifts at different times of the day, using other people's equipment and equipment.
An essential step in protecting workers, customers, interviewees and others in the workplace is to quickly identify and isolate potentially infectious people.
Employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness are advised by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stay at home, as long as they are free of fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medications, and should flexible sick leave policies, which allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and employees should be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, medium-risk jobs in contact include jobs where COVID-19 is not known or suspected to be present, but people who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 are frequently or closely required to be quarantined within six feet (1.8 m) due to the ongoing disease spreading among the public at the place of business or because the person has recently traveled to an international location where COVID-19 has spread widely.
This includes employees with whom there is public contact, with whom there is a risk of exposure to COVID-19 (e.g., in schools, in workplaces with high concentrations of COVID-19 exposure, in workplaces with high levels of exposure to hazards of exposure to COVID-19, in workplaces with high levels of exposure to hazards, and in the workplaces where employees are exposed to the risks of being exposed to COVID-19, and in the workplaces where employees are exposed to the risks of exposure to the workplace, and how they are exposed to others.
Employees in this risk group are required to use respirators in rare cases.
If a person becomes sick on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect staff and other passengers include isolating the sick person at a distance of 6 feet from others, specifying a member of the staff to serve the sick person, and providing a face mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with tissue during sneezing or coughing.
Cabin crews should wear disposable medical gloves when responding to a sick traveler's call or touching liquid or potentially contaminated surfaces in the body, and possibly use additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or shortness of breath.
Gloves and other discarded items should be discarded in an organic risk bag, and contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial vessels, including recreational vessels and other passenger vessels, risk controls include deferring travel if sick, isolating yourself and informing the ship’s medical center immediately if someone has a fever or other symptoms while onboard.
In ideal cases, medical follow-up should be carried out in the cabin of the person who has been quarantined. In case of school and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning or disinfecting if an infected person enters the school building, regardless of the spread of the disease in public.
When the disease spreads from minimal to moderate levels within the community, social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as canceling field trips, gatherings and other large gatherings, such as physical education or eating in concert music classes or cafeterias; increasing the distance between desks, separating office hours and holidays, limiting the use of unnecessary interviewers, and having a flu-like symptom for children.
When the disease is widespread in the local community, additional social distancing strategies may be considered to increase schoolwork. The CDC considers the immediate risk to the health of staff to be lower in law enforcement who carry out daily routine activities.
Law enforcement officials who are required to contact people who are confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If employees come into close contact during an emergency, they should clean and disinfect their duty belts and equipment using a household cleaning spray or wipe before reusing them, and follow evidence management procedures to control and cancel used PPE.
OSHA considers certain healthcare and death-related services workers to be in the high or very high risk category of exposure.
Those at high risk of exposure include healthcare providers, support, laboratory and medical transport workers, who come into contact with patients who are known to have COVID-19 or are suspected to have it.
If workers perform aerosol-generating procedures, or collect or move samples from patients who are known to have or are suspected to have COVID-19, they are at a higher risk of exposure.
Aerosol-generating methods include inserting a tube, initiating procedures for cough, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and testing or instrumentation to collect samples.
High-contact, death-related jobs include workers who were known to have COVID-19 at the time of death or who were suspected to be involved in preparing the body; this becomes a very high exposure risk if they perform the autopsy. Additional engineering controls for people in these at-risk groups include procedures that are known to have COVID-19, while also having separate rooms for patients who are suspected to have COVID-19.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be suitable for some healthcare and bathroom environments.
Samples should be handled in accordance with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated to individual waiting areas based on whether they are suspected to have COVID-19. For people who are known to have SARS-CoV-2 or suspected to have SARS-CoV-2, OSHA recommends respirators in addition to other PPE for people who are within 6 feet of working and performing aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, including health checks, training, and medical tests, NIOSH-approved N95 or better filtering facepiece respirators must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve employee comfort. WHO coveralls do not recommend, since COVID-19 does not spread through bodily fluid components, but rather is a respiratory disease.
The WHO recommends a surgical mask only for screening personnel at the entrance.
The WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles, or face shields, gowns and gloves for those who are collecting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-generating procedures.
If an aerosol-derived process is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given the inadequacy of PPE supplies worldwide, WHO recommends using telemedicine, physical insulators such as transparent windows, to reduce the need for PPE, and only those who are directly involved in the caregiving process have been advised to allow one person to enter the room with a COVID-19 patient, to wear a mask only after certain tasks required for, not to allow the use of PPE, and to continue to monitor its use without removing the respirator while caring for multiple patients with the same disease.

We are in a very difficult situation this year.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a global phenomenon that makes clear the global human interface and our responsibilities towards each other.
There is no precedent for its challenges before us, but we know that our best response depends on the universal compassion, cooperation, and building of society at the heart of this organization.
The intimacy, trust, and care we have seen through email, calls and chats among all our colleagues is a significant demonstration of the incredible people we have been fortunate enough to work with.
I am very grateful and proud to have all of you as colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world right now to be able to see Wikipedia and how powerful it is to have this important resource online and available to everyone.
Your work makes it possible, whether you keep the sites running, pay our colleagues, or keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a moment where not only what we do, but how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant changes from this coming week in the way we work together.
Adjusting our work and schedules
As Robin mentioned earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and set a schedule for the days and months ahead.
We thought about the appropriate response to the situation we were facing, and we considered in that conversation the best way to sustain the company at this time.
Most of us wanted to relieve pressure and support our cause for the long term.
If you need a backup, there's no problem.
For all employees, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work expectations until further notice will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week.
We're not declaring a holiday - if you're able to work at a more normal time, the mission may employ you.
But the world is uncertain at the moment, and whether you need to take care of your loved one or bring groceries or go to the doctor, staying well is our priority.
We don't control your time.
Don't work when you're sick.
It's hard to say, but we're saying it.
There's no sick leave or PTO required - just tell your manager and help your team revise calendars and schedules to make sure the key areas of work are covered.
(If you are positive for COVID-19, please let Brian of T&C Ops know so that T&C can help and ensure that your situation receives proper attention from the authorities).
Full-time employees will be paid.
We have already said, and we pledge once again to honor our commitment to our contractors and hourly colleagues.
Under normal circumstances, everyone will be paid on the basis of the normal hours they work.
If you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people use work as a way to shift their stress from the world around us to a specific direction.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially at times like these.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We want you to keep in touch with your manager so that we know what to expect and can adjust accordingly.
Some things are considered essential.
There are some things we need to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) do essential work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all of our departments to evaluate current goals and shift our focus to collaborating on what is needed for our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, only we will focus on the most important projects.
It doesn't hurt to work slowly.
We don't want to go back to work after the pandemic has passed.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to complete the work within the time frame, which is no longer realistic.
We acknowledge that the situation has changed, and where appropriate, we will work to set new targets and deadlines.
What's going on with the annual report?
In order to align with our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we also want to adjust the timeframe for the delivery of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will give employees more time in budget preparation to prioritize essential work, take care of themselves and care for loved ones, as well as to accommodate the demands of those who want to work on a reduced schedule for the next few weeks or need to do so.
This extension of time greatly reduces the workload of the current plan and the pressure on the entire organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and we will update delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as possible as we receive confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Office status, contact and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
But with a lot of caution, we hired a virus-causing cleaning staff team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a virus-resistant solution of hospital-appropriate quality to disinfect every surfaces and lobbies and elevator banks that enter our floor.
The building is employing its own attendant duty protocol user products that help in the safety of their tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has exchanged its COVID-19 protocol with us and with all DC-based staff members.
Last week our DC office moved to a fully remote setup in line with the instructions given to San Francisco.
Some of our NYC-based colleagues know that we were also discussing leasing a place in Brooklyn.
Discussions are still ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-time remote colleagues know that this can be adjustment, and wanted to give you some advice:
Limit the length of the meeting to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how they can be divided into smaller portions over a few days.
Explain the meeting clearly, keep a schedule and send the text materials in advance.
With tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and connection, make video the default.
Keep a lead to facilitate each meeting, ask someone to observe the questions in the chat and keep an eye on the list of speakers, and ask someone to write a note (or take notes cooperatively).
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to Tech Support.
Make use of your swatches for the swatches.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the work being shared.
The HR management team is looking at webinar-based ergonomics guidance to help with the growth of the foundation's distributed work.
This past week we asked all community donors to cancel public events, such as the Wikimedia-funded Editathon, until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We inform them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible for them to complete their agreed grant activities and that no one will be penalized for delaying or correcting these goals.
In this coming week, we will inspire additional guidance for Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
There seems to be both a sadness to the disruption of general attitudes from the entire global community, but at the same time a relief in the ability and clarity of focusing on their own communities, both on Wikimedia and elsewhere.
In the coming days, CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a place for the public to observe the impact and follow our communications with them.
Staying in touch with COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional updates and answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We are all in this together and we will do everything we can to help.
In the meantime, you can continue to search for information from this email, and other vital information related to COVID-19 at Office Wiki.
The CRT will keep these pages updated and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contact with staff currently living in significantly affected countries.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workstream or coverage challenge, or if you need help with anything else, please do not hesitate to let us know and work with CRT.
We are here to help and support as needed.
If you have confidential or sensitive information, please email Brian Judan, director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as an abdication of our work and responsibility.
Rather, it is a recognition that our actions and responsibilities at the moment are likely to be adapted to a way we have not done in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to help each other, so that we can continue to work, provide the support our movements need, and provide the services the world depends on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us.
Now is the time to help each other and make room for the important work that is going to come in the coming weeks and possibly even months.
We need all of you to do this, and so we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can be healthy when you need to.
Now, please - wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Catherine, the CRT team (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Hyme V, Joel L, Linnet L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Hyme V, Jenine U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
B'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer layer (cell membrane) of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestinal cells.
ACE2 opposes the work of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing anng(1-7) making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as HACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme that is present on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has an N-terminal peptide M2 domain and a C-terminal calctrine renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, the active site of which is unwanted on the surface of the lungs and other tissue cells.
The exogenous domain of ACE2 is divided from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddes and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually released through the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly attached to the membranes of cells related to lung II type alveoli, small intestinal enterocytes, most of the artery and venous endothelial cells and arterial nerves are attached to muscle cells.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as the counterbalance of ACE.
ACE angiotensin I divides the hormone into vasoconstriction angiotensin II.
ACE2 isolates the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it to vasodilator angiotensin (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg-I-Hr-Val-T)
ACE2 can distinguish a few other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 regulates the exchange of membranes of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with heart failure.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as a point of entry into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus responsible for SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19).
More specifically, ACE2's enzymatic domain binds SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2's spike S1 protein to the surface of the cell, causing endocytosis and displacement of both viruses and enzymes within the cell.
This entry process also requires priming of S protein by host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently under investigation as a potential curative. This has helped some to speculate that lowering levels of ACE2 in the cell may help fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of evidence-based ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
"A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that ""compared with the controls, using ACE inhibitors had a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia."""
"Moreover, ""the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, particularly patients with high-risk strokes and heart failure."
"The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related death rates, although the results were less potent than those for the overall risk of pneumonia."""
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) was considered a novel therapy for acute lung damage and appeared to improve the pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation of pigs with signs of lipopolysaccharide-induced acute shortness of breath.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the onset of action is about 30 minutes, also the duration of effect (durability) is 24 hours.
Various studies have shown that people who do not tolerate first-class renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or have an illness where angiotensin II transmission is increased may experience rhACE2-responsiveness. Symptoms of acute respiratory illness (Acute Respiratory Dissertation)
"b'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to identify contacts in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying individuals (""identity"") who have been in contact with an infected person."
Numerous applications were developed or proposed with official government assistance in some areas and jurisdictions.
A number of infrastructures have been built for the creation of communication detection apps.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially with regard to systems that work on the basis of identifying the geographical location of app users.
The relatively intrusive entry options include the use of Bluetooth signals to log a user's catch-up to other cellphones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would integrate the functionality of supporting such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has launched an app in conjunction with Alipay that allows citizens to check if they have had contact with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used across more than 200 Chinese cities. An app called TraceTogether is used in Singapore.
The app, created by a local IT group, has been released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia “Stop the Corona!”, a Bluetooth-based app launched with the goal of identifying the symptoms of a potentially infected person and providing a quick response to healthcare authorities.
The app has been developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
The app has been awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store since April 14, 2020.
"On 12 April, the government announced that the Connection Search app is in an advanced stage of development and will be available to work in a few weeks. A similar app (""StopCovid"") is planned in Ireland and France."
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia is planning to launch a geofencing app for COVID-19 disease-free patients living in Moscow, to ensure they don’t leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including a lack of performance if the fall is positive and app acceptance is limited to a small section of the public.
"Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple has set limits on what types of companies can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, limiting them to only ""government"" or otherwise reputable companies."
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Those who advocate for privacy expressed their concerns about the implications of surveillance on the public using coronavirus apps, in particular, about whether surveillance infrastructures designed to combat the coronavirus pandemic will be eliminated once the threat is gone.
Amnesty International and more than 100 organizations have issued a statement calling for 100 such surveillance to be restricted.
The organization announced eight conditions regarding the government project:
"The supervisory must be ""legal, necessary and proportionate""."
There should be a sunset clause in order to increase monitoring and surveillance;
The use of data for the purposes of COVID-19 must be limited;
protect information and identity and demonstrate evidence-based protection;
Digital surveillance had to be done to stop discrimination and marginalization;
The sharing of any data with third parties must be made clear in the law;
Citizens should have the right to protest against abuse and abuse.
"All ""relevant stakeholders"", including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be required to participate." German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have issued checklists."
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address persistent surveillance issues by removing tracing processes from their devices' operating systems if they are no longer needed.
Some countries used surveillance on network-dependent locations instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid surveillance.
In Israel, network-based identification was allowed.
Network-based solutions that have access to crude location information have significant potential privacy issues.
However, all systems on the central server do not require access to personal location data; multiple privacy-preserving systems have been created that use the central server only for interconnection (see section below).
An appless system was used in South Korea to monitor contact.
Instead of using an engaged app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined these to send notifications via text messages to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn of potential exposure, the government has made available information about the location to the public, in which case some issues were approved due to far-reaching changes to the Data Privacy Act following the outbreak of MERS.
This information is available to the public through many apps and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using both centralized and privacy-preserving systems.
As of April 6, 2020, the details have not yet been released.
It is a well-established idea to identify privacy-protected communications, including a tangible part of research education that began at least in 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as recording proximity to other cellphone users using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that has both centralized and decentralized methods and is not a single code of conduct. Decentralized code of conduct covers decentralised privacy-preserving proximity detection (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka contact numbers, CEN), mobile contact detection (PACT) for encryption and other sensitive behaviors.
In these protocols, identifiable personal information never leaves the device and occurs within all matching devices.
MIT Media Lab is developing the Privacy Group SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or path intersection data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on a white paper titled ‘Apps That Have Been Deceived: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic’, published in March 2020. Another similar effort is Enigma MPC’s SafeTrace platform, the privacy technology maker that was also founded by MIT Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of the information.
On April 5, 2020, the Universal TCN Alliance was founded by a group that aimed to reduce fragmentation and enable the universal interoperability of identifying and alerting apps, including those that are a key aspect of widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it has an open-source BlueTrace protocol that is being used by its official app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms respectively, announced an initiative to find people in contact, which will protect privacy as they claim, based on a mix of Bluetooth low energy technology and privacy-protecting cryptography.
They also provide information about the technology used in the project.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be available in three stages:
Roll-out of tools, to enable governments to create privacy-preserving official apps to detect coronavirus
Integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android: Google and Apple first distribute the system through operating system updates and then plan to solve the take-up and continuous surveillance problems by removing it in the same manner as the disaster passes.
B'drug repositioning (also known as re-profiling, re-profiling, or remedial drugs) is an approved drug used to treat a disease or condition that is different from the one initially developed for it.
This is a path of scientific research that is currently being followed to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma infection. SARS-CoV-2 contains nearly 66 drug-specific proteins that each contain multiple ligand binding sites.
These binding sites provide a reasonable project to create effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins by analyzing them.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP riboflavin.
Hussen A. A., and others studied a variety of candidate compounds that were optimized and analyzed in his pre-clinical studies for candidates' skeletal similarity by most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a potent SARS-CoV-2 anti-malarial drug to recommend clinical study design.
Chloroquine is a malaria-resistant drug that is also used against some auto-immune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and the associated hydroxychloroquine were among the four drugs to be studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that testing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the state of New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA for clinical trials and is only approved as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but are not able to participate in clinical trials under the European Union.
"The CDC said that ""the use, dosage or durability of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection"" has not yet been proven."
"Doctors say they are using the drug ""because there is no alternative""."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large-scale research is underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting an experiment on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
"Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show Favipirabi to be ""clearly effective""."
In the middle of the 4 days, 35 patients in Shenzhen had a negative result, while 45 patients who did not receive it had an illness length of 11 days.
In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia conducted in Wuhan, half were given favipiravir and half were given umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of the drug is extremely inadequate and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy drugs from Japan to stockpile and use the military to deliver the drugs to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Sinzo Abe has proposed to the Trump administration about buying the drug. The drug may be less effective in cases of the severity of the illness where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or those who are trying to get pregnant.
"A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of antiviral drugs of lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that ""no benefit was observed."""
The drugs were planned to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to change drugs to find a compound that will bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There is criticism within the scientific community about using resources to change the purpose of drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Mutual Support Test.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in in-vitro against multiple filo-, pneumo-, paramexo- and corona-viruses.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and infections.
Several early pre-trial studies indicate that remdesivir may have high genetic barriers to prevention. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two trials conducted by the University of Cleveland Hospital; one for people with moderate illness and the other for people with additional severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of vitamin C to provide intravenously for hospitalized and critically ill people with COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one unregulated (Italy).
New York State began trials for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning to conduct a clinical trial for the corticosteroids taken by inhalation of taijin's alvesco (cyclosanide), to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
Serious, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 with 200 patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria is undergoing a type of trial to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, looked at 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and experienced mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or who do not have an effective contraceptive method, are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular-weight heparin being widely used to treat patients encourages the Italian Medicine Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study on the use of anoxaparine sodium in immunosuppressive and palliative medicine in 300 patients was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, conventional scientific attention has been focused on repurposing approved anti-venom drugs that were developed for earlier outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment as per China's 7th edition guidelines.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with the Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Some of the antibiotics that have been identified as potentially new-use as a treatment for COVID-19 are:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
Italy and China are also testing. See Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
The B'A COVID-19 vaccine is a planned vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several efforts are in progress to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect an effective virus, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, to be available in less than 18 months.
In April, there were five vaccine candidates in Phase I safety research.
COVID-19 was detected in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to substantial investment and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Many companies are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was said that the condition of the CEPI initiative to make vaccines is speed, production capacity, large-scale application and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were working towards research and development in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The major platform goals that have advanced to Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus-causing carriers (Phase I developers and vaccine candidates: Cansino Biologics, Adenovirus type 5 vectors)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 people are in the early stages of improvement, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79 people according to the Milken Institute) and 37 others have been reported, but all of this comes from data that has been slightly released to the public (estimated).
The Phase I-II test conducts preliminary safety and immunity tests, and is usually done in an aggressive, placebo-controlled, and multiple sites when determining a more precise, effective dose.
Phase III trials, including the effectiveness of vaccine trials and control groups to prevent disease, typically involve more participants, while monitoring adverse effects on optimal drug levels.
"From 79 vaccine candidates in active development (as confirmed as early as April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated humanely (yet under ""preclinical"" study)."
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland in Australia announced that it was exploring the possibility of a molecular binding vaccine that would modify genetically viral proteins to evoke immune responses.
Around January 24, 2020, in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-Intervac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced plans to begin work on a vaccine with the goal of starting human trials in 2021.
The vaccine development projects were announced on 26 January 2020 at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and on 28 January at the University of Hong Kong.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun work on developing a vaccine.
Janssen is developing the vaccine in conjunction with its biotechnology partner, VaxSart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent Bio Solutions announced a partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, Romania's Oncogene Laboratory published a short essay on the design of a vaccine of the same technology used for neoantigen vaccination therapy of cancer.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting trials.
On February 27, 2020, NewsNerex Immuno-Oncology, a subsidiary of Generex, announced that it was launching a vaccine project to develop a LI-K peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to create a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans within 90 days.
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced plans to develop their vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materials Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both in West Maryland, announced they were working on a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had partnered with Novavax Inc.
development and production of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans to conduct preclinical testing and phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that it was working on 11 isolates and that it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine, though at a rapid pace.
On March 12, 2020, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronavirus-like molecules, partially funded by Canadian institutes for health research.
The vaccine candidate is under study at the laboratory in a plan to test on humans in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered to give Kurivak a "massive sum of money" to get exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which the German government protested against.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop mRNA-based vaccines.
The candidate for mRNA-based vaccine BNT162, which is currently in pre-clinical testing, and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, in Italy, an Italian biotech company named Takis Biotech announced that they would have the results of a pre-clinical trial in April 2020 and that their final vaccine candidate could be tested on humans in the fall.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations in France (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, CEPI) announced an investment of US$29 million in a research association for the development of COVID-19 vaccines, which was associated with Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of T<0xC3><0xAD>tika of Themis-19.
CEPI's other investment partners for the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russia's health authorities announced that scientists had begun six different vaccine candidate trials on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were preparing a self-enhancing RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was made within 14 days of receiving the order from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical defense against COVID-19, including numerous vaccine candidates at Canadian institutions and universities such as the University of Medicago and Saskatchewan.
"At the same time, the Canadian government specifically announced C$192 million for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, and several new vaccines also have plans to establish a national ""vaccine bank"" that can be used in case of another coronavirus outbreak."
"On April 2, 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on a potential COVID-19 vaccine trial called PittCoVac on mice, which states that ""the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines extracted by MNAs had strong antigen-specific antibody responses [in rats] that occur at the beginning of the 2nd week after vaccination."""
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced plans for a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
DNA will be designed using bacteriophage to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, a combination of cloud computing resources from Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, created the U.S. government, industry, and three universities to gain access to supercomputers from IBM.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also known as non-specific effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the diseases that they prevent.
An additional 4,170 health care workers are being sought to be enrolled for an extra-ordinary trial in Australia.
There is a possibility that the vaccines under development will not be safe or effective.
The primary study to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine in COVID-19-specific animal models such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other animals in the laboratory, and non-human mammals indicates the need for biosafety-level 3 control levels and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures for the management of live viruses.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health organizations around the world. There is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS emerged, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for preparing vaccines and vaccines against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that had completed the first clinical trials in humans and another three are ongoing, all of which are viral-vector vaccines, two adenoviral-vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have propagated a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and a vaccine was already available.
The patents mentioned in various social media posts relate to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other types of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases have mild symptoms, in some cases progress can lead to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered from the virus. The virus spreads primarily through smallpox particles caused by coughing, sneezing, or talking during close contact.
When spit particles are produced during inhalation, they usually fall to the ground or surface rather than spread over long distances.
People can also get infected by touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching contaminated surfaces.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although it is most likely to spread before the symptoms appear and at a later stage of the disease. The ideal method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from the nasopharyngeal swab.
Those suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers are advised to wear masks.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their use, and others requiring their use.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking up, and swelling of the mouth or lips; medical care is advised immediately if these symptoms are present.
Relatively less common, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, watering through the nose, or sore throat may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been observed with a variation of percentages.
In China, some cases were initially seen only with chest compressions and chest cramps.
For some, the disease can lead to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death.
This is called the embryonic stage.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who are showing symptoms will be seen within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not everyone who is infected has symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence suggests they may have a role in spreading the disease.
The proportion of infected people who have not shown symptoms is currently unknown and being studied, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) report said, with 20% of all confirmed cases asymptomatic while in hospital.
China's National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases among its daily cases on April 1; 130 of the 166 cases (78%) were asymptomatic during testing that day.
Both saliva and saliva can carry a large number of viruses.
When you speak louder than usual, the spit comes out.
A study in Singapore found that small droplets can spread up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) as a result of a mouth-covered casserole.
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that bioaerosol infection may be possible, and the air collector placed in the hallway outside the human's room gave a positive sample of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause respiratory secretions to become airborne particles, resulting in airborne spread.
While there are concerns that it may spread through feces, this risk is thought to be low. The virus is most contagious when symptoms appear in humans; it may be possible to spread before symptoms become apparent but the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, but one person usually infects two to three people.
In particular, up to a day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours on 99% copper were found to be detectable.
It varies depending on temperature and humidity.
Soaps and detergents can also be effective if used correctly; the products of Saban break down the fatty protection layer of the virus, making it inert, and freeing them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken in the middle of two days after hospitalization began.
The first sample of five of the six patients showed the most virus, and the sixth patient showed the most virus when tested on the second day.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a team of patients with acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are seen among the related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in household soap, which breaks down its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 has a close relationship with the original SARS-CoV.
Lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) found in the lung type II alveolar cells.
"The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called ""spike"" (peplomer) to connect with ACE2 to enter the host cell."
Acute cardiac injury was seen in 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is higher due to systemic inflammatory responses and disorders of the immune system during the development of the disease, but acute myocardial injury can also be related to the heart's ACE2 receptors.
ACE2 receptors go quickly to the heart and are involved in the heart action.
Thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be related to impaired prognosis. Individuals who died of COVID-19 have had diffuse alveolar damage (diffuse alveolar damage, DAD), and prostatitis seen in the lungs.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tendency to move towards the epithelial cell -ACE2, which connects the respiratory tract, acute COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells in COVID-19 patients have been shown to be associated with inflammatory IL-6-detachable monocytes and serious lung pathology relapses (recursements).
Lymphocytic infiltrate has been reported in the examination of the body.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The ideal method of testing is to use reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by the nezopharyngeal swab; however, nasal swabs or spit samples may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be done, but these require two blood samples to be taken at intervals of two weeks and the results have a low immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the strain of the coronavirus and reveal genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and detect whether a person has been infected in the past) were in preparation for development, but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience in testing showed only 60 to 70% accuracy.
On March 21, 2020, the FDA in the United States approved the first localized swine flu test for use at the end of that month. The pathological guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University recommend infection detection methods based on clinical features and epidemiological risks.
Bipolar, multilobar ground-glass opacification is common in primary infections, including an endogenous, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Depending on the progression of the disease, subpleural predominance, irregular paving (lobular septical thickening by filling with variable alveolar) and aggregation can be observed.
There is very little information available about the pathophysiology and microscopic lesions of COVID-19.
The main pathological facts of the post-mortem investigation are:
Macroscopy: Pulmonary pleurisy, pericarditis, lung consolidation (lung water catch) and pulmonary edema
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: Inflammatory and multinucleated monster cell formation, including pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large-scale atypical pneumocytes, lymphocytic infiltration
Severe pneumonia: Damaged diffused alveolar (DAD) with dispersed alveolar excretory matter.
DAD is caused by acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia Sarano: Organization of the extracts in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoarthroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds, and practicing appropriate respiratory hygiene practices, and not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue during coughing or sneezing and using the inner side of the elbow if no tissue is found.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends using cloth face coverings in public to limit the spread of infection by asymptomatic people. Social distancing strategies are designed to reduce contact with infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, limiting travel, and canceling large public gatherings.
The guidelines also include that people should stay at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away.
"There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19. Since no vaccine is expected to be available before 2021, the key part of COVID-19 control is to try to reduce the peak of the pandemic, known as ""flattening the curve""."
The CDC also advises people to wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if the hands are apparently dirty, before eating and after brushing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available. In places where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
The activation of antimicrobials in these preparations is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is ""not an active substance for hand antiseptics""."
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
Human beings are driven by supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and assisting other affected critical organs.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of carrying the virus wear a face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to solve the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatment may be effective in people with similar symptoms in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have released recommendations to take care of people with COVID-19 who are hospitalized.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the United States have organized the medical recommendations of various organizations at the free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen for primary use.
Precautions must be taken to reduce the risk of virus infection, especially in healthcare environments when procedures such as intubation or hand ventilation are performed that can create airborne particles.
For healthcare professionals serving people infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that in addition to using evidence alerts, touch-related alerts, and airborne alerts, people be kept in an airborne isolation room, AIR. The CDC describes the instructions for using personal protective equipment (PPE) during the global pandemic.
Recommended tools are: PPE gowns, respirators or facemasks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirators (instead of facemasks) are recommended.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments but the FDA has approved masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but efficacy against certain biological material is not guaranteed for label-indefinite use.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends wearing face coverings or homemade masks as a last resort.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or options, but some cases are severe enough.
High-flow nasal cannula or by-level positive airway pressure to avoid intubation is being actively studied for people hospitalized with COVID-19-related respiratory failure.
It is not known whether either of these two will lead to the same benefit for those who are seriously ill.
Few doctors choose to keep it through when invasive mechanical ventilation is available because this technique limits the spread of airborne particles compared to the high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases are most commonly seen in older adults (those who are over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits health management's ability to cope with a sudden increase in the number of severe COVID-19 cases that require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support for ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people infected with COVID-19 are finally admitted to the ICU at the hospital.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as severe respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly inconvenient.
Pressure control mode and high PEEP-enabled ventilators are needed to maximize oxygen delivery, while ventilators need to reduce the risk of related lung injury and pneumothorax.
High levels of PEEP may not be found in older ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical trials of a number of antiviral drugs are underway.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although it may take until 2021 to develop new drugs, several of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced trials.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with severe diseases.
WHO’s proposed volunteers will participate in trials on the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has temporarily approved Convalescent Plasma as experimental treatment where the person’s life is in serious or immediate danger.
There have been no studies done to prove that it is safe and effective.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect 'near contact' using surveillance data and consequently the potential risk of infection.
Each user can check the status of the other three users.
The app not only recommends self-quarantine when potential risks are detected, but it also warns local health officials. Big data analytics, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used by cellphones to monitor infected people and people in contact in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to monitor mobile phone data of people suspected to have had coronavirus.
The measures were taken to protect people who may have come in contact with infected citizens and to enforce quarantine.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom distributed unified phone location information to the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency, for the purpose of preventing the spread of the virus and for research purposes.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to identify the quarantine breaker.
"Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile phone operators had informed him that ""40% of the population was moving around anyway""."
The German government organized the 48-hour week-end hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid also called for a global call for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may feel ill due to quarantine, travel restrictions, medical side effects, or fear of infection on their own.
"The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, ""The increased social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress, and economic downturn are a perfect disaster for people's mental health and well-being."
Similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold, the disease can progress with little or no symptoms.
Small cases usually recover within two weeks, but it can take three to six weeks for patients with severe or severe disease to recover.
Pregnant women may be at risk of severe infection with COVID-19 based on information from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but there is a lack of data on COVID-19. In some humans, COVID-19 can damage the lungs by causing pneumonia.
In most people with severe COVID-19, acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS) can rapidly increase which can lead to respiratory disorders, septic shock, or multi-organ failure.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Among those admitted to hospital with COVID-19, an abnormality of blood clotting, especially an increase in the duration of prothrombin time, was evident in 6%, while abnormal kidney function was seen in 4% of the group.
An increase in liver enzymes (transaminosis) has been observed in about 20-30% of people who have COVID-19.
According to the same report, the time between the onset of symptoms and death, including five hospitalizations, was ten days.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early cases, the median time from the onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total duration of six to 41 days.
According to a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8%, while the death rate for women was 1.7%.
Post-mortem histopathological tests of lung samples show damage to the alveoli spread, including the release of cellular fibromyalgia in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The picture of the lungs is similar to that of acute respiratory illness syndrome (Accut Respiratory Disturbance Syndrome, ARDS).
Heart damage was identified as an increase in cardiac arrest or troponin levels in 11.8% of reported deaths by China's National Health Commission.
According to data from March in the United States, 89% of those hospitalized had pre-existing conditions. Socioeconomics and availability of medical resources in a region can also affect mortality.
The mortality rate from this disease varies not only due to regional differences but also due to systemic difficulties.
Lowered mortality rates for mild cases can be overestimated.
However, the fact that the death is the result of a past infection means that the current mortality rate is being underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers, and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die. Concerns have been raised about the long-term consequences of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital authorities noted a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans indicated organ damage.
This can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether past infections provide effective and long-term immunity in people who have recovered from the disease.
The chances of immunity are very high based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but in those cases, recovery from COVID-19 has been reported after a later positive test result of coronavirus.
These cases are feared to be due to a further deterioration of permanent infection rather than re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and has an animal source, through extra-clinical infections.
The actual source is unknown, but the spread of infection by December 2019 was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, reported the first date of onset of symptoms as 1 December 2019.
The earliest onset of symptoms was reported by official publications from the WHO on 8 December 2019.
A number of methods are used to determine mortality.
These numbers vary by region, and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as the amount of testing, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, the time it has been cut since the initial outbreak, and age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO specified the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in the lab, while the un-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection shared the U07.2 code for deaths due to COVID-19, which was clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed. The death-to-case ratio (death-to-case time) was defined as the number of deaths (death-to-case time)
Based on figures from Johns Hopkins University, the global death toll and case ratio is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The numbers vary by region. Other measures include Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which identifies the percentage of people who have died from the disease, and Infection Fatality Rate (IFR), which identifies the percentage of people who have died from the disease.
These figures do not have a specific time frame and follow a specific population from infection to diagnosis.
Although antibodies are not produced in all infected people, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
The epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Cassiglione Diada, is a small village of 4,600 people, where 80 people (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangolt, the disease was spread through the carnival festival and spread among younger people, which causes relatively low deaths, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been officially classified.
In addition, the German health system has not been damaged.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of blood donors may have antibodies as assessed.
69 people (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed dead from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate is different for men and women.
The mortality rate among men is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women ends in the 90s.
The mortality rate in China was 2.8 percent among men and 1.7 percent among women.
The exact causes of these gender differences are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors can cause them.
Gender-based immunological differences, the prevalence of smoking in women is relatively low, and the development of co-morbidities in men at a younger age than women such as high blood pressure may have a role in higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died of COVID-19 were men.
Since April 2020, the U.S. government has not been monitoring gender data on COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral illnesses such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
The majority of health workers, especially nurses, are women and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
"On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the official name of the disease would be ""COVID-19""."
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means Corona, VI is the virus, D is the disease, and 19 is when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid mentioning specific geographical locations (e.g., China), animal species, or groups of people, in line with international recommendations for naming for the purpose of preventing malignancy. The virus that causes COVID-19 is named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
"The WHO uses additional ""COVID-19 virus"" and ""virus responsible for COVID-19"" in public communications."
"Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as ""coronavirus""."
"During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as ""coronavirus"" and "" Wuhan coronavirus""."
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV for acute respiratory diseases as temporary names for viruses and diseases, in accordance with 2015 guidelines in terms of the location of the virus and the use of the disease.
The official names for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare components such as nasal swabs and ventilators due to capacity constraints in the ideal supply chain.
In one example, an Italian hospital tested the manufacture of a manufacturer's product and produced the required 100 valves overnight when the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time frame if a very urgent need for a ventilator valve.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and rumors about the origins, levels, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly online.
Humans are thought to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find any evidence of replicating the virus in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is ongoing by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "mutual support test" to assess the treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the highest promise of efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several companies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are used by ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccines are being developed.
First, the researchers focused on developing a complete virus vaccine.
The purpose of using the virus, whether inactive or dead, is to neutralize the human body's immediate immune response to a new infection caused by COVID-19.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to specific subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study targets the S-spike protein that helps the virus to enter the ACE2 enzyme consumer.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, novel strategy for vaccine making).
For safety and efficacy, experimental vaccines will have to be tested from either of these strategies. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The virus that causes the disease is contained in the genetic code vaccine that does not cause replication damage. The antibody-dependent growth has been pointed out as a potential challenge to the development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but it is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials have been underway since April 2020.
Seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most of China's research is being done to use antiviral drugs for different purposes, and nine Phase III trials on Remdesivir across different countries are scheduled to report by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates was prepared in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon beet, lopinavir/ritonavir.
There is experimental evidence of efficacy by Remdesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with remdesivir experimental drugs.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China, and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, research needs to be reviewed.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, when the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a dose of one village per day, it is noted that twice the dose of this drug can be extremely dangerous and deadly.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use approvals for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19. The Chinese 7th Edition Guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir in the context of COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further vivo studies after showing a low concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that preparing the primary spike protein by transmembrane protease Serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry through replication with the ACE2 receptor.
There are serious limitations to the study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin that have prevented the medical community from taking these therapies without further study. Oseltamivir in vitro does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The next stage of severe COVID-19 can be a cytokine disaster.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have antihypertensive properties of cytokines. Tocilizumab has been included in China’s National Health Commission medical guidelines after completing a small study.
After seeing positive results in people with severe disease, it is undergoing phase 2 non-invasive testing at the national level in Italy.
To identify a cytokine disaster, blood tests combined with serum ferritin are meant to prevent the progression of the disease, which is thought to cause death in some infected people.
In 2017 CAR T cell therapy was approved by the FDA on the basis of a past-relevant case study to treat steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause.
To date, there is no conclusive, controlled evidence that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Those who have recovered from COVID-19 are being investigated as a non-vaccinated method of inactivated immunization of refined and dense antibodies produced by the immune system to those who need them.
This technique was tested for SARS with unsatisfying results.
Viral inactivation is the expected mechanism of special treatment through which passive antibody therapy can mediate the defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, the use of monoclonal antibodies produced, are on the way to development.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of blood fluids taken from recovered patients, and specific antibodies to this virus can be quickly extended to the organization.
Coronavirus diseases, a class of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan's Central Hospital, died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
