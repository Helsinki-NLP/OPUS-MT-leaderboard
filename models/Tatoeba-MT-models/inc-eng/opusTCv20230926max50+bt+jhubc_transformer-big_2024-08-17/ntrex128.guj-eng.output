Whelans AM was concerned about a mapet-like appearance
Some AMs are upset with the suggestion to change their title to MWPS (Member of the Whales Parliament).
It was created due to the change of the name of the Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
The entire political spectrum was worried that it might lead to ridicule.
1 a labourer said that his group was concerned about what "matches TWP and PWP2".
For readers of Outside the Walls: Whales T.W.P. means Fool and PWP means P.W.P.
Plaid Am said the entire group was "not happy" and suggested options.
Whelan's conservatives said his group had an "open mind" about the name change, but it noted Mapet from the MPWP as being a "truncated" literal jumper.
In this case, the English equivalent of the English equivalent of the English equivalent of the English equivalent of the English equivalent.
The committee, which drafted the name change law, said: "The final decision on any description relating to what will be said to the members of the legislature will certainly be the members' own."
The Government of Whales Act 2017 empowers the Assembly of Whales to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which was identified as having broad support for the legislature to be called the Whales Parliament.
In the matter of the title of AM, the Commission favoured the Whales Parliamentarians or the WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in public consultation.
AM appears to be suggesting alternative options, but depositing a raw draft of the law relating to the changes within a week from whom to expect a consensus for the authorized officer, Ellen Jones, could be a headache.
The manner in which the legislature functions in a law relating to amendment will include rules relating to disqualification of AM and other changes relating to it, including the design of the committee system.
When the AM will discuss the law, they will get a final vote on the question of which name they should be called.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
A popular vote was held to resolve the decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a territory known as Macedonia.
Ethan had long been adamant that his northern neighbor's name represented a claim to his territory and had repeatedly opposed his bid for membership for the EU and NATO.
MacDonald's opposition to the change of name, President G<0xC3><0xB6>zl<0xC3><0xBC>k Ivanov, said it would not take into account the referendum.
However, referendum supporters, including Chief Minister Zorn Zev, argued that the change in name was only the price paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells became quiet as the churches in Harlem were in trouble.
"Historically, the older people I spoke to said there were bars and churches in every corner," Adams said.
"Today, there is no food."
He said that it is understandable that the twelve were to be invisible.
"Today, people are socialized in different ways," he said.
"Now there won't be twelve long next to dwelling houses where people go regularly."
Because for the churches he was worried that the money from property sales would not last as long as the leaders wanted, "and sooner or later they would get back to where they started."
He added that condominium apartment buildings full of people who do not help the rest of the neighborhood's holy places can replace churches.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be Dhola people," he said, "and so the day is not far off when these churches will be completely closed because most of the people who come into these condominiums are unlikely to become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a Black Metropolis - the year 1870 after the decade of the Metropolitan Community, St. Martin.
The original white Methodist congregations were gone in 1930.
Black congregations praying nearby seized possession of the building.
The main street of shopping in Harlem was occupied by the black congregations led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who objected to keeping or encouraging black people.
The building was heavily damaged in 1939, but as Father Johnson's clergy planned to rebuild, they began to bellow.
Father Johnson's father Rev. David Johnson and St. Martin's Successors proudly identified the bell as "the bell of the poor."
Experts who rang the bell in July called it something else: "cultural treasures" and "historical tools that cannot be changed."
Tiffane Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first phenomenon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a large carillon in a riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not take his place.
What was happening to St. Martin over the past few months was a story of complex sculptures and contractors, some brought in by the church's raw leaders, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
Vestry - The Paris governing body, made up of raw leaders, wrote to Dioscuri in July to Vestry with concerns that Dioscuri was "not involved in keeping the sculptures and contractors sent by Vestry Dioscuri, despite wanting to pass with the cost."
Some of them complained about the lack of transparency of the media.
Shark injures a 13-year-old man in a lobster dive in California.
On the first day of the opening of the crab season, a 13-year-old boy in California was diving for crab on Saturday when a shark attacked and injured him, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacons Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was diving with his friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help and then with the group to help pull him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just a desire to catch crabs, but then he "discovered that he was shouting, I understood a little!"
I've got a little understanding."
His entire arm was uncovered," said Hamel, who noticed the boy when he found him.
"I shouted for everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hamley added.
The boy was airlifted to the Ready Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was kept in a critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told the media that a few weeks ago a shark was found in the area, but it was determined that it was not one of the dangerous shark species.
He added that the victim had sustained serious injuries on the upper part of the neck.
Investigators and security officials closed the beach for 48 hours, from Ponto Beach in Casablade to Swami in Esinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area but most have not been considered endangered.
The U.S. stock market crash has hit the beauty market in the UK
Sensbury Boots, Superdrag and Debenhams are being housed in a department store by a style beauty expert with assistant staff.
The <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market in the UK, where fashion and homeware sales were falling, will see large beauty items being tested in 11 stores across the country as a sustainable push and, if successful, taken to more stores.
Investing in beauty is used as a way to use the immaculate spaces held for TVs, microwaves, and homewares.
Sensbury said it would double the size of the beauty materials it offers to up to 3,000 items, including Revlon, Essai, Twisserman, and Dr. Pavpav for the first time.
L'Oreal's current range of mabiline and brit's bees are also found in shops like Boots, which will have more space in branded areas.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique makeup range so that most items are tight-suited to vegetarians - that's what's growing in demand among small shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop at two Sanbury stores will experiment with discounting, the first of which is in Croydon, South London, which opened last week while the second is due to open later this year in Sallie Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping online and buying small amounts of food daily from local convenience stores means supermarkets have to do a lot to get people to visit.
Mike Kaup, Sansbury's chief executive, said: "Shops will continue to grow like department stores as supermarket chains strive to offer more services and non-food returns to discounts to Aldi and Lady.
Senbris has been keeping Argos shops in thousands of stores and starting a number of settlements since the two chains were brought in two years ago, which is said to have supported grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
An earlier attempt by supermarkets to improve their beauty and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sansbury tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the alliance ended up on how to get a share of the revenue from the chemist's store in their supermarkets.
Three years ago, when Sansbury sold its 281 store pharmacy business to Lloyds Pharmacy chain owner Malik Selesio for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, new strategies came to the fore.
Loyds in four stores, including La Roche-Posse and Wichita, will play a role in planning their skincare brand by increasing the luxury range, it said.
Paul Millas-Hicks, Sansbury's commercial director, said: "We've made improvements to the look and feel of our beauty materials to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained co-workers who will be helpful in giving advice.
The range of our brand is fixed to meet all needs and a pleasant atmosphere and convenient destinations, that is, we are now a destination for beauty materials that challenge the old style of shopping."
Peter Jones became obsessed after Holly Willoughby pulled out a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal.
When TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal, Dragons Den star Peter Jones became obsessed with doing his lifestyle business with Mark and Spencer and ITV
In fact, Mr. Hodgson doesn't have time for his family and friends.
Pierce's business was linked to the Gwyneth Paltrows Goop brand.
The 37-year-old actor took to Instagram this morning to announce that she is leaving.
At the end of the day, Holly Willoughby pulled out of the lucrative lifestyle brand business to focus on her new big deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV, leaving "Dragons" star Peter Jones in trouble.
Sources say that when Merlo Buckinghamshire, headquarter of her empire, admitted in a tense meeting on Tuesday that she had made a new deal worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meaning she didn't really have time for her homewares and accessories brands, Jones was "rumoured."
The business was similar to the Gwyneth Paltrow Group brand and more than doubled to Villaughyabai's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that she was actually leaving, as Jones left the UK to go to one of their holiday homes.
The source said: "It's actually the highest priority for Holly so far.
It was going to be her long-term future in which she could see herself for a few decades to come.
Her decision to retire surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe how close it was to the start of what was happening on Tuesday.
Marlowe Headquarter was full of face-to-face sales for the warehouse
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter this morning, one of Britain's most trusted stars, could cause the firm to lose millions of dollars due to heavy exposure to a range of items from cushions and blankets to clothing and homeware, which could further delay its launch in the future.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother and husband of three Villaghbayans, Dan Baldwin Jones, and his wife Tara Cape have been close for ten years.
Willoughby actually set up the setup in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Spending a few vacations with him and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in the Beldwin TV production firm.
Willoughby became the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of IM Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said: "We didn't comment on his business dealings last night."
It was hard, and then we fell in love."
He also warned the news media that he would be criticized for his comments, some calling it "unexpected" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump do this?
Trump responded by saying that he was a "newsreader."
"I haven't done anything wrong."
It noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump arranged the opening meeting in Singapore in June, a major step toward the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for the release of nuclear weapons broke down.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, R.I. Young Ho, told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not seeing a "relevant response" from the U.S. over its early denuclearization measures.
Instead, it noted, the U.S. has started issuing targeted sanctions to continue pushing.
During the course of his speech, Trump showed a lot of optimism.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were heading towards war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
"We have this wonderful relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded good results - rocket tests were stopped, hostages were freed, and the rest of the U.S. military returned home.
And he defended the unusual approach of talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to get president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get in from this closed battleground, we have 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia's tsunami and earthquake devastated the island, killing thousands.
After the Lombok earthquake, for instance, foreign non-governmental organizations were told not to need it.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been temporarily displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a pre-requisite for seeking international help.
"In many cases, in turn, they were very clear that they were not seeking international help, therefore, it was a little bit challenging," Ms. Sumbang said.
While Save the Chiltern is trying to move to Palo, it is not sure whether foreign workers can work on the ground.
Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said that Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts.
Given the way the land of Indonesia is constantly vibrating, this country is sadly inadequately prepared against the fury of nature.
This view is not commonly seen on the coast when tsunami shelters are built in Essaouira.
Although the warning is in effect, there are chances of loss of life due to the lack of siren warning of a tsunami in Palu.
At the best of times, it is challenging to travel to many islands in Indonesia.
Natural disasters make systems more complex.
The hospital ship is in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made improvements to Indonesia's existing infrastructure a key issue in his election campaign, and he spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funding put Mr Joko's administration in jeopardy as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure due to protracted sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced more conservative sects.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven out of their homes as Christians and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, and other lethal weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge plays deep-dipped Burberry v. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London to save Liverpool from a defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League.
When his team was 1-0 behind Chelsea, Sturridge got a 30-yard pass from Kshirdan Shakiri.
He took a step to the left before he hit the ground with his left hand.
The attempt went off the box as it crashed into the upper corner of the right side of the net.
At the end of the day, the sledgehammer fell to the ground and fell into the water.
"It was just an attempt to get into that position, to reach the ball and play forward as much as possible, so, I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolIFC.COM.
"I saw Kante coming and touching and couldn't think much about it and just took a shot."
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead of Belgian star Eden Hazard at half time after scoring in the 25th minute.
The Blue Striker stopped spinning in the middle of the field and gave the Meteau Covesican a pass again in that game before rushing to Liverpool's half.
Kovacic was quick to give up in the middle of the field.
Then he threw the beautiful throw ball, which led Hazzard to the box.
Hazard got out of the rescue and ended up in a net of a distant post through a shot in the left foot and overtook Allison Baker of Liverpool.

The death toll from Indonesia's tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early on Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings brought down by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused waves as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 people, was filled with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman's death
The woman's body was found this morning at Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old man was found with a groin wound at 7.55 a.m. on John Street in Grayson Moz, where he was arrested on suspicion of murdering a 32-year-old man.
Police are appealing to anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would urge anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious about the area around Johjon Street in Birkenhead to contact us.
I would also urge anyone to contact us, especially the taxi drivers whose dashcam footage has anything to do with being caught because they may have information that is important to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman who was found dead was a local from Birkenhead and that she was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman, came to the spot this morning to ask questions about where she was found.
The investigation has begun as police said they are in the process of informing the victim's next-of-kin.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Meadows, was still trying to return to his flat, but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
When he realized what had happened, he couldn't say anything.
Residents have been told that it will take hours for them to be allowed inside.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
I saw a woman with her eyes on the ground.
She used to say that she is very hateful
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the besieged area with a van parked outside.
A number of officers were standing inside the cordon and overseeing the block of flats.
Any person having information has been asked to inform DM<0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers by referring to log 247 of 30th September on 0800 555 111 by hiding the name.
The Cromwell Parliament's statue has become a famous monument for rewriting history.
His exile would be poetic justice for the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious works, such as the Taliban, created by his religious holy followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "The current debate about the removal of Oliver Cromwell's statue outside Westminster Palace did not prevent it from being targeted.
The Iconoclasm of the English Civil War did not command nor was it stretched by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed in the previous century for the actions of his ancestor Thomas.
Sir William Hemo Thornecroft's wonderful representation of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of historiography of the personality that many still consider important to celebrate.
Mr Goldsmith told the Telegraph: "Cromwell was remembered as a protector of Parliament against many external pressures, perhaps even more so today than at the end of the 19th century, in his case certainly a monarchy."
Whether it is accurate representation or not is a matter of continuing historical discussions.
It is certain that the discord in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was the laudable figure who represented one side of that part.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and memorial ceremony.
Chinese farmer killed by Maoists in China.
According to local media reports, a farmer was brutally attacked and killed at a market in south-west China.
Only the man identified by his surname "Yun" was found near Sty after reports on Sunday morning that he was in a blood-stained condition with a broken artery at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou, South China.
On May 30, 2005, a farmer in China's Xining of Qinghai area was preparing to inject the groundnuts into the hog.
According to the report, he had come from Yunnan area with his cousin on Wednesday to sell 15 bullion in the market.
The next morning, his cousin saw him dead, and found the door of the neighbor's dungeon sty open.
He said that the big mistake in the stye was with his mother's blood.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a 550-pound pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
My cousin's legs were bloody and chaotic," his cousin, referring to him as "Wu," according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed the young man entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The man who killed him was not his father's son.
When police gathered evidence from the spot, the market manager told the evening news that the bhood was locked to prevent anyone from attacking.
The victim's family and market authorities were found to be negotiating compensation for the death.
Despite the exception, there have been cases of evil men being attacked earlier.
In 2016, a brown woman and her husband were attacked on their farm in Massachusetts with serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound bunny stuffed a farmer of whales into his tractor until his wife moved away in fear of the janitor.
After eating an Oregon farmer by its brunt in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the brunt is usually not aggressive but the taste of blood can "inflame" it.
"They're just in the game.
They're nippers, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
"You just have to respect them," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rain to the southwestern U.S.
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it passes through the cold waters of Mexica.
However, it is expected to bring rainfall to the entire north of Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
At 5 a.m., Rosa had a wind speed of 85 mph, a range of 1 hurricane. According to Eastern Time on Sunday, and Punta of Mexico was located 385 miles south-west of Eugenia.
It is expected to move northwards on Sunday.
By then, a crater has begun to form in the Pacific Ocean and moves eastwards across the western coast of the US Rosa Baja will reach California on Monday as a tropical storm that will begin to push deep tropical moisture northwards into the southwestern US.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in areas of Mexico.
Then, during the next few days, the tropical moisture will bring widespread heavy rain to the south-west region.
At the local level, 1 to 4 inches of rain can cause dangerous flood conditions, waste flows, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will cause 2 to 3 inches of rain per hour at some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
The southwest region is expected to receive between 2 and 4 inches of rain, especially in most of Arizona.
The unexplained nature of the tropical rainfall is likely to cause anxiety floods with rapidly devastating conditions.
It is advisable to venture into the desert for a walk under the fear of tropical rain.
Due to heavy rains, the valleys can become flowing rivers and the cyclones will bring in local storm winds and dust.
The approaching trough will bring heavy rain to some localities off the coast of southern California.
Cool half an inch of rain is likely to cause small waste streams and narrow roads
This will be the first rain of the wet season.
Some scattered showers will start arriving late on Sunday and early on Monday in Arizona before the rains become more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
There will be heavy rain in the four corners on Tuesday and it will continue till Wednesday.
There may be some slight rise in temperatures in October across the US as the northern hemisphere is cooling, but the tropics remain very warm.
In some cases, this leads to dramatic changes in temperature.
Sunday is the best example of a dramatic temperature change in the central U.S.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa is about 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the delayed summer heat will increase and try to spread again.
Large parts of the central and western U.S. will see a heatwave beginning in October that will widen from the southern plains to the northeastern parts by as much as 80.
On Tuesday, New York City could reach 80 degrees, which will be approximately 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long - term weather forecast shows that by the first half of October there is a very high probability of temperatures exceeding average over the eastern U.S.
The trial of Brett Kavanaugh was watched by more than 20 million people.
Thursday's testimony on Brett Kavanaugh, who filed a nomination by the Supreme Court and accused her of sexual assault in the year 1980, on Christine Bales, was viewed by more than 20 million people on six television networks.
By that time, broadcasters had begun the political standoff: a contract drawn up by Arizona Sen. Jack Flake for the FBI to conduct an investigation into charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh had caught her drunk and tried to strip her of her clothes at a secondary school party.
Kavanaugh, in a hasty deposition, said he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
There is a possibility that more than 20.4 million people saw that air was recorded by Nielsen.
On CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC, the company got an average viewership.
Statistics were not immediately available for other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, which demonstrated that.
And Nielsen usually had some trouble measuring people who were looking at offices.
To put it in perspective, the size of these spectators was the same as a playoff football game or an Academy Award.
The Fox News channel whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment had overtaken all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearings, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million.
There was more interest after the hearing.
Friday's drama was about a man who lived in the center of the flack.
After the Central Republican Office issued a statement that he would be voting in Kavanaugh's favor, he was caught on camera barricading opponents by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he was on his way to the lift for a hearing of the Justice Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes as it was produced, broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
"She was told, ""You have power while some women are weak."""
Flake said his office issued a statement and said he had a lot to tell the hearing committee before the lift closed.
When the Justice Committee was to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for the entire Senate, all cable and broadcast networks were covering hours of live broadcast.
But he said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, which the minority Democrats were requesting.
Flake was believed to some extent through a conversation with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coon.
After a discussion with Koons and some of his later senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake had the authority to choose, as it appeared that the Republic of Cavanaugh would not have allowed without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister can accuse the critics of playing politics over the Brexit issue.
In an interview with The Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May could be accused of "playing politics" with Britain's future and disregarding national interests in exchange for TICACORO's accusation that she was about to leave the European Union.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In her post-interview interview on the front page of the newspaper, she attacked her former foreign minister Boris Johnson by telling him of the checkers' plan for Brexit, saying the UK and the EU's proposal to collect each other's tariffs was "totally irrational."
Ved Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dayteon Simpson for killing LSU player
The LSU police arrested 20-year-old basketball player Ved Sims for allegedly shooting the suspect dead.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Officers released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims' glasses were lost during the fight.
Police found glasses from the spot and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Sivasan, the police said that he had fatally confessed to Vayed that he had shot me.
His bond was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The office of the Parish Corner on East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report Friday showing the cause of death as a gunshot wound to the inside of the neck.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police, and the citizens who helped with the investigation, which led to the arrest.
The LSU athletic director, Joe Alewa, thanked the area's law enforcement for their "starting to do their duty and delivering justice."
Simon was 20 years old.
Botton grew up in a 6-foot-6 forward where his father, aged, also played basketball for the LSU.
In the last season's game, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "in the middle" due to Vaide's death.
"That's what you're always worried about," Wade said.
Volcano erupts in Mexico City
The ash flying from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhood of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDC) on Saturday warned residents of Mexico to stay away from volcano activity for 24 hours after 183 gases and ash began to come out.
The center was monitoring multiple sounds and tremors.
Photos on social media showed a thin layer of ash on car airstrips in Mexico City's neighborhoods, such as <0xC5><0xA0>ochmilco.
Geologists reported increasing activity in volcanoes that have been 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goo" has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the independence vote, the Catalan police clashed with the separatists.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes with riot police and thousands of people joined a revenge demonstration on the first anniversary of Catalonia's demolition on the split.
Face-covered groups of people who supported the separatists were pushed back by riot police, threw eggs and threw paint powder, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets usually filled with tourists.
The crowd also dispersed later in the day after the police used their batons to stop the clash.
For a few hours, anti-independence groups were brazenly shouting "no apologies, no apologies" which were met with anti-union chants such as, "May Spain live forever."
Fourteen people received treatment for common injuries sustained during the protest, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in an area favored by independence even a year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist cantons.
Voters chose to be independent with an overwhelming majority, however, as the opponents of the partition boycotted the vote for the most part, the people who voted were few.
According to several authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop those who went to vote at polling booths in all areas of violent clashes.
Anti-independence groups set up tents outside on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in favour of the national police.
They wanted to go, but they had to take a different route.
The 68-year-old electrician, Narcissa Termes, who participated with his wife in a protest against the separatists, said he had no hope of Catalonia getting independence.
Last year we had the best time of our lives.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote but now we are trapped," she said.
Despite a special arrangement for regional elections last December, many pro-independence parties have found it difficult to keep up with the madness this year as many of their well-known leaders have either self-exiled themselves or are in prison for their role in gathering a referendum and then declaring independence and awaiting trial.
John Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protesters in his phone in favor of police, said the rift was provoked by politicians from both sides.
"It was getting more and more painful," he said.
Oriol Junqueras, who has been in jail since late last year, announced on Saturday that he would contest next year's European Parliament elections.
"Standing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to restore democratic values and condemn the oppression we have faced from the Spanish government," he said.
London: A man was arrested after his car broke into the house.
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly broke into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Inspector Bob Blamming, who carried out the investigation, said that the doors and the building were also damaged.
In some cases, a car can also catch fire with a crossbow.
Manga stroked Livingston to a 1-0 victory against the Rangers.
Dolly Manga's first goal of the season for Livingstone
Excited Livingstone surprised the Rangers as this was only the second defeat in Steven Gerrard's 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Manga's strike proved to be the difference between the two as Gray Holt's team moved one level ahead of Habernia in the second.
This season of the Premiership, Gerrard's team stayed away from the win and will have to face the leaders who are eight points behind them on Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
By the time Livingstone will begin his undefeated run in the six-game division, Holt has not yet tasted defeat since taking over as head coach Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone will lose chances against visitors without an edge.
Before they scored, Holt's team should have been very far ahead, having problems with their Directing Rangers all the way.
Scott Robinson was completely broken but continued his efforts against the goal, then only Alan Lithgow was able to pull off his attempt after sliding the head of Craig Holckett to meet him around the goal.
The hosts had content to let the Rangers play in front of them, they knew they could get visitors into trouble piece by piece.
And that's how the big goal came about.
The Rangers accepted the free-kick and working on the Livingstone opening, Daclan Gallagher and Robinson gathered to arrange a mea culpa that touched and scored from the middle of the box.
Until that stage, the Rangers held a hold on the possession but the home defense was impeccable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly most likely didn't have to do anything.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morello was forced to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was forbidden by Ranger goalkeeper Allan McGregor's foot, and Livingstone's player, Lithgow, who was set for the game, struck wide.
Livingstone's box continued to cross, and he went through two penalties after supplemental player Glenn Middleton was challenged by Halket and pushed away a handball.
'Extraordinary' - Analysis from Livingstone
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont on the playground of Tony McAvoy
A remarkable performance and result by Livingston.
For a man, he was wonderful, starting to rise above his expectations.
His style of playing and players have hardly changed since he was given the best game, but he gets a lot of credit for the way he has tempered the team since the season started.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halket handled the beautifully arranged defense very well while the Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warrel in constant activity.
Nevertheless, the Rangers were less motivated.
They were good as long as they were under the garrison, they stayed lower than its standards.
Their final ball was lacking - only once they had exposed the home team - and it was time for the Rangers to wake up for those who saw themselves in the middle of the table.
A warm welcome was accorded to the aristocracy in
On Saturday (September 29) there was a smile and a bleak sky in the faces as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations between the NATO Allies.
They raised issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then proceeded to Cologne to inaugurate a new large mosque.
It is the most populous city outside of Turkey.
Police gave security reasons for stopping a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but how many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Thousands of opponents of Erdogan - many of them Kurds - voiced their opposition to Erdogan's decision to include him in the country, both the police and the German government.
The two-fighter opposition characterized the visitor's admiration as a hero divided by some German Turks and discredited by others as an autocrat.
Road accident: One killed, another injured in road accident
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision took place near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street junction on a busy road in the south-east of the city at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car was standing and paramedics examined him, but he died on the spot.
The collision came a month after a second cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Children's Street, about a mile from Saturday's collision.
The Metropolitan Police said they were working to identify the man and inform his next-of-kin's family.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been diverted and motorists have been advised to avoid this route.
Long Lartin Jail: Six officers injured in road mishap
Six prison officials were injured after unrest in the prison of high-security men, the prison office said.2
Arrangements were broken on Sunday at about 09:30 BST at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and it is still under way.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been brought in to quell the unrest, which includes eight co-workers and one wing.
Officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deputed to deal with the problem of MMP Long Lartin.
Six members of the staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could be jailed for a long time."
The HMP Long Lartin housed more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most notorious criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor was treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot control officials were called to jail to resolve the serious unrest in which employees were attacked with a pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa on Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City triggers fear of flooding (drought-affected areas may benefit)
Tropical pressure rarely hits Arizona, but something similar is going to happen early next week as the rest of Hurricane Rosa's energy has caught its way through the entire southwest desert, risking a surge of anxiety.
The National Weather Service has already set up sightings for concern flooding for Monday and Tuesday in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and western Arizona, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake.
Rosa is expected to catch a direct route to the phonetic on Tuesday, which will arrive with rain late on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted: "Since 1950, there have been only ten tropical cyclones in the 200-mile area of Phoenix that have created a state of storms or tensions!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane located in an area of 40 miles of the AZ border."
State-of-the-art National Hurricane Center models have predicted sporadic rain of up to 2 to 4 inches along the Mogollon rim in Arizona.
Other desert areas in the south-west, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, are expected to receive up to 4 inches of scattered rainfall with 1 to 2 inches.
Out of the anxiety floods that are at risk, the rainfall of Rosa can be a blessing as the region is drought-prone.
Though the flood is a matter of great concern, some of these rains are likely to be beneficial as the south-west is currently facing a drought situation.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, the second-largest category," weather.com reported.
First, the route to Hurricane Rosa makes landfall in Baja California Peninsula, all of Mexico.
With a maximum hurricane speed of 85 miles per hour, on Sunday morning, Rosa is still 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is coming in contact with cold water in the Pacific and therefore its intensity is decreasing.
Thus, it is expected to hit the ground in Mexico with a tropical storm speed later in the afternoon or evening on Monday
Heavy rain can cause flooding across much of Mexico.
"Cool rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to north-west Sonora which is likely to increase to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Then, as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical pressure early on Tuesday morning, Rosa will make its way north across Mexico, which will then make its way through Arizona to southern Utah by Tuesday night.
"Rosa that its remains are expected to cause major damage by very heavy rains in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
The rainfall is expected to bring about life-threatening flooding and landslides in the desert and hilly areas
Midomar Norton attack: Four arrested in attempt to murder case
A 16-year-old man in Somerset has been arrested on suspicion of attempting to murder three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man after being found with a wound with a sharp weapon.
At 04:00 BST on Saturday, a teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Redstock area of Avon, and Somerset police said.
Officials have requested everyone who has any mobile phone footage related to what happened to them to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh suffered, that is, the anger of the Democratic Party
"Vote for Judge Kavanaugh means rejecting the rigours and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered the Democratic Party's "minus, fury" during the entire process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh was put to the test before Congress on Thursday, with Christine Blaise vehemently and emotionally denying the accusation made by Ford that she sexually assaulted him decades ago when he was a teenager.
Ford was also examined during the trial relating to the allegation.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, "the American people showed the brilliance and the quality and the courage of the Kavanaughs."
"One vote for Judge Kavanaugh confirmation is a confirmation of the vote for the most complete legal mind of our time, a jurist with a certified record of public service," he told a supporter crowd in West Virginia.
The President specifically referred to Kavanaugh's nomination with regard to the importance of turning the Republican into an interim election.
"Five weeks away from the most important elections of our time."
I'm not running away, but I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for the best candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that Democrats are on a "mission to resist and to disrupt."
The first key procedural vote in the House on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be no later than Friday, a senior GOP leader told CNN.
Thousands of people have been killed by the earthquake, tsunami, this number is still increasing
At least 384 people were killed when an earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, with large waves hitting the coast, leaving many stranded, authorities said on Saturday.
When the six-metre (18-foot) high waves hit the coast of the city of Paul on Friday evening, thousands of people gathered on the seashore to celebrate the festival, with waves that swept many people to their deaths and destroyed what came in their way.
The earthquake of 7.5 magnitude was followed by a tsunami.
"Yesterday, when the tsunami threat arose, people were still doing their activities on the seashore and did not immediately flee and suffered," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it struck cars, logs, houses, whatever in the ground," Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coast, the tsunami traveled at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) across the open sea.
Some people climbed into the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were shifted to 24 centres in Palu.
An aerial photo released by the disaster agency shows that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, the pools have turned and collapsed and there is water all around the mosque.
On Wednesday, the city's water supply began to deteriorate after the earthquake.
Earthquake tremors were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Implementation of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's terrible earthquake was about 200 times more than the atomic bomb dropped in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which is covered by a long narrow bay coast, may have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, it said, adding that an additional 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said that the 300 km (190 mi) Donggla off the northern coast of Palu, an area close to the epicenter of the earthquake, could have caused more damage to lives and property.
The communication system in Donggla is "completely broken, there is no information," Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in its statement, adding that staff and volunteers were moving towards the affected areas.
"It's an accident by itself, but it could be more pronounced," he said.
The agency was severely reprimanded on Saturday for not informing it of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
In the footage released on social media, a man from the top floor of the building can be heard warning people down the street that a tsunami is coming.
Within minutes, the wall of water hits the beach, taking the buildings and cars with them.
The Raiders were unable to find a quick fix.
Earthquakes and tsunamis unleashed widespread power that disrupted communication around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military from Jakarta and other cities began sending cargo planes with help materials, authorities said, but the displaced people still needed a lot of food and basic necessities.
The city's airport is open only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo visited the relief camps on Sunday.
The death toll from Indonesia's tsunami has risen to more than 800.
Its very bad.
When World Vision employees arrived safely from Donggla to the city of Palu where employees were sheltered in tarpaulin shelters in the courtyard of their office, they saw scenes of destruction along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me how many houses they saw that were destroyed," he said.
Its very bad.
Even when aid groups started disaster relief operations, some complained that highly-skilled foreign aid workers were also prevented from entering Palu.
According to Indonesian law, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only come if the affected area is declared a national disaster area.
That hasnt happened yet.
"It's still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for Indonesia's Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'It's a national disaster,' we can open up international aid, but that's still not the case."
The second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami came upon Paul, so those whose friends and family were still missing sat down with the hope that there would be miracles with their loved ones that there would be untold stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was pulled out of the gutter.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been buried under the body of her mother who had been standing next to her for two days.
JENDON SUBANDON, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games that were collapsing from Indonesia earlier this month.
Among the others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi who was involved was his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gando recalled how the news was delivered to the paragliding community hours after the Roa Roa hotel collapsed, sending a WhatsApp message to Palu Hariphon, who was attending the beach festival.
However, in his message, instead of two brown cheques, only one gray cheque was seen.
"I don't think it's meant to convey the message," he said.
The thieves took away $26,750 while filling an ATM at Newport in Levi's.
Thieves stole $26,750 when Brink's workers were filling out an ATM at Newport in Levy on Friday morning, according to news released by the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car in the entertainment complex was vacating the ATM and preparing to make more money.
While he was busy, the other man "runs after Brink's employee" and steals the bag for delivery.
The witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police could not determine the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person with information regarding their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper has changed his name to Yee
The rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Yee.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Officially known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West was nicknamed Yee for a while and used the title Moniquer for his eighth album released in June.
This change has come before his appearance in the live program on Saturday night, where he is scheduled to launch his new album Yandy.
She took the place of singer Arian Grunde on a show that had been cancelled "for sentimental reasons," the show's creators said.
As well as a shorthand for his current business, West had previously said that the term has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is a frequently used word in the Bible and in the Bible it means 'you'," West radio host Big Boy Say said earlier this year when discussing his album.
"So, I am you, I am we, that's us.
He removed the Kanye, which had only one meaning, which showed only our good, our bad, our confusion to everyone.
This album sheds more light on what we are."
This is one of the many names that have been changed.
Sin Combs was known differently as Puff Daddy, P Diddy or Diddy, but this year released his choice of names as Love and Brother Love.
The former West Colonist, Jay-Z, also did a duet with or without the hyphen.
Mexico's AML has vowed not to use military force against any civilian.
Mexico's President-elect Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military pressure against civilians as the country was approaching the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown against students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador will "never use the military to suppress the Mexican people" at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday.
While the left-wing student movement was deploying its roots throughout Latin America, soldiers opened fire on protesters performing peaceful demonstrations on the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at the time.
Lopez Orbador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more public universities.
He said that the lack of jobs and educational opportunities in the country has led to youth being pushed into criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double AI funding.
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of research being done in that field, says investigator and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Li who worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments came after AI was announced by various parts of the US government, which also lacks a formal AI strategy in the US.
By then, China presented its plan last year: it aims to become No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Given that all other countries are far behind the US, doubling the budget of AI research would be a good start, and we look forward to the next success at AI," Lee said.
Doubling funding will double the chances of a major breakthrough in the next AI in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Miffin Harcourt, CEO of Innovation Ventures, invested in China's most important AI company, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In 1980, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that could beat America's high-ranking Othello player, and then he was executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee welcomed technology competition such as the robotic challenge from the previous US government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when it would be next to help identify the next vision.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work very hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking on academic leaders; it's corporates," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have recruited brilliant people from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. increase its AI efforts, Lee said,
"I feel that those who have done Ph.D. in AI should be given green cards automatically.
China's State Council issued its plan to prepare the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation funds people from educational institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is poor, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve industry partners and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
It currently invests more than $100 million annually for AI research for NFS.
By then, no action in U.S. law to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence had been observed for months.
The Macedonians voted for a referendum on whether to change the country's name or not
On Sunday, Macedonians voted on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve decades-old differences with Greece that prevented their bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province known as Macedonia, says it belongs to a northern neighbor. The name refers to its claim to its territory, and its NATO and EU entry into the EU was blocked by using a veto.
In June, the two governments struck a deal based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the name change would reduce the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Selvik majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote for the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the minimum 50 percent of people needed for the referendum would come out to vote.
The question regarding the reading of the ballot for the referendum: "Did you accept the agreement with Greece to become a member of NATO and the EU?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was reasonable to pay the price for Macedonia, one of the countries formed by the fall of Yugoslavia, and for institutions such as NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live independently under the roof of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us," said Oliviera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Though not legally binding, enough people in Parliament said they would stick to the outcome of the vote so that a decision could be reached.
A two-thirds majority is required to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 pm.
However, in the last election of the year 2016, when 66 per cent of the Cool registered voters cast their votes in the ballot, only 16 per cent of them came to vote, compared to 34 per cent of them.
"I came out to vote because my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old voter Gjos Tenevski in the capital Skopje.
On September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorika and his son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko cast their votes in a referendum to change the name of Macedonia's territory, paving the way for him to join NATO and the European Union.
In Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Karvadarkov was preparing a small stage in front of the parliament and placing chairs in front of tents set up by people who boycotted the referendum.
"We're for NATO and the EU, but we want to keep our heads up and join, not through service," Kawadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we are proud of it.
If they don't want to take you as Macedonia, we can be like China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment into Macedonia, which has more than 20 percent unemployment.
"I think the big majority will be in his favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," Zeve said after casting his vote.
He said "yes" to the future.
A poll released by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - less than required.
Another poll carried out by Telema TV of Macedonia revealed that 57 percent of respondents thought they were going to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
A 50 per cent vote is needed to be successful.
The failure of the referendum will be the first blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took office on May 2 last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigating the defense of the entire Brygheton for the Aguero goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahm Stirling sealed a 2-0 win over Manchester City at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England on Saturday
Aguero looked ridiculously easy in his 65th minute of the game.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentine striker found a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran between the three defenders of Brighidton before hitting into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He'd been shot multiple times in the back of the head by a passer-by before he was able to get out of the car.
He then turned to the left, where he was standing.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give Aguero a back ball that used his right boot with a shot on the right side of the net to beat Brigitte's keeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero was facing some problems at his feet," city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about his game for 55, 60 minutes.
Thats what has happened.
We were lucky to have him at the time."
But it was Sterlin who benefited from the Sky Blues in the early stages of the Premier League Scuffle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that game the Aguero got the ball in the Brighton Deep.
He sent the ball through the throw to Liroy Sein with the left flank in a belligerent manner.
He took a few steps back to the front of the room before pulling the remote.
Sky Blues sent the ball into the net before taking it beyond the boundary.

Shaffer wants to play against Spurs.
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-offs controversy, there was no good reason to force another start.
But always competitive Chaser looks forward to a round against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the play-offs have an impact for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have confirmed a wild-card spot with at least a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to lock up their first-class title.
Even though we're not playing to achieve anything, at least we can toss the rubber, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowds and other forces will probably be played to the highest level of any encounter this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly in a position to let Scheizer pitch in such a situation.
Scheizer, who will make his 34th start, will give a bullpen session on Tuesday and pitch on the rest of his usual Sundays.
The Washington Right-Handler is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 stroke-outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to hold rally in West Virginia
When the President was talking about the importance of the Republican Turnout in the midterm election, he was referring to the selection of Brett Kavanaugh of his Supreme Court for the surrounding situation.
Everything we've done in the past has been done in the past.
We are five weeks away from the most important decisions of our lifetime.
This is one of the big ones, the big one -- I'm running, but I'm really running, so I'm fighting for the best effort everywhere."
Trump said, "You see the terrible, desperate radical group of Democrats, that's what you see happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by using the tools anyway, you see the murkiness and malaise.
They don't know who they're actually hurting, and they're crushing to gain power and control, that's why they want power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
"Democrats are on a mission to 'oppose and create barriers'," he said.
And you see that in the last four days, he called Democrats "angry and ugly and evil and untruthful."
He was given a ranking of Democratic Sens by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Diane addressed the audience in the name of Feinstein, which was well received by the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you signed up for the newsletter?
Yeah, yeah, what.
No, no, no, I'm waiting - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The church is no longer a large church.
It's an insult to those who speak their mind.
When I was invited to the party, I was pleasantly surprised by the support of my colleagues.
Finally, I'm the latest in the Labour MPs, who say you're not welcome - everyone's saying it to us.
My parliamentary colleague, John Ryan, was treated the same way because she stood firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censor's proposal for a disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn was critical of me.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on similar issues due to the Wittgenstein.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday said, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
As a local Labour MP, my eight-year-old, Friday night's GC meetings were the same.
It is sad that this is not the tone of many meetings today and the essence of "compassionate, humble" politics has long been forgotten, even though it has begun in earnest.
It is clearly evident that different views are not shared in the Labour Party and each consultation is evaluated on the basis of whether or not the leadership of the party is acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, as a colleague with whom I had previously drawn a similar political line, I would take a U-turn and expect to find myself in a position for which I could never agree – whether it was a national security or an EU single market.
Whenever I give a speech in public - and it doesn't really make any difference what I'm talking about - after a nasty comment on social media that calls me for not being elected, rejects the politics of the Centre, I'm told that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And my experience is not the same.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are political.
I am dedicated to the professionalism and determination of those professionals who face sexist and racist ideologies every day but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this season is the way the offense has been handled.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a comprehensive church and the party is becoming increasingly narrow with each "no-confidence" motion or change of the rules of the election.
In the last two years, I've been advised several times that I should focus on keeping my head down, not being so blunt, and then I'm going to "get better."
But that's not what I did in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, instigated by the neglect of the government, which had left my commercial schooling behind, I had sought support for better public services for those who needed them most - be it as local councillors or as ministers of government.
In the last election, I never hid my politics.
No way in the East of Nottingham could be confused with the views of my policy, and with the current leadership, in the area of disagreement
All I will say to those who are propagating the proposal on Friday is that when the country is moving towards Brexit, it will damage homes, businesses and our public services.

Iyer 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Iyer Goes to the Top
The two delayed attempts may have significantly reduced the final result, but it was undoubtedly the right thing to do to win the Iyer's unique victory in this wonderful tennis match of the day.
Now it's at the top of the charts, the only invincible party of the decade.
In the end, it was his outstanding defense, just as he had the right to take better chances, to advance the domestic team, and to please coach Peter Murchi.
He said: "We've done it before and we're still happy with the result.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Iyer deserves credit, he took his chances better than us.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, replaced by Frazier Clemo, was put on the Iyer front, but a yellow card for Scotland's captain Rory Hughes, published by Warriers for the game, allowed Merloes to show the number, and Jason Negotiated Bagot caught the unrelenting effort.
Climo increased Iyer with a penalty, scoring exactly before half-time, and at break time Iyer converted in a single attempt to make 17-5.
But Melrose made a good start to the second attempt and Patrick Ederson's attempt was reduced to five points converted by Begotten.
Then there was a serious injury to the Ruridih Note, which was given a stretch and then re-started, with a converted attempt by Clemo to push Stafford McDowell further to the Iyer.
When Iyer's acting captain, Blair McPherson, received a yellow card, Melrose paid off the excess with an undefeated Bruce Klollwin's effort at the end of a serious push.
Although the home-side returned, and when Stroo Hutchinson was given a yellow card from the penalty line-out to meet Clemson without the ball, McPherson touched the back of Adair Maule.
Climo was converted, Carrick restarted it, after Kelly Rowe collected David Armstrong and sent Flanker Gregor Henry for Homer's fifth attempt.
Even today, the sport's star restaurant seems to be set for a new career in the industry.
Still, the sport's star is ready to go into the hospitality industry after it was reported that he has been nominated for the directorship of a licensed restaurant.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis performs on the BBC's popular show, which he is writing and co-starring with long-time co-singer Greg Bumpphyll.
Both have announced that there will be an upcoming new series at the end of the show and it seems that Kieran is planning for the post-crawl life.
According to the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmoren Limited.
The actor declined to comment, but a Scottish Sun source indicated that Kieran wanted to join Glasgow's "rich restaurant business."
The sea is ours: Bolivia hopes the Pacific will re-open for them
Marines patrol a large number of naval headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings have a flag of the color of the sky.
Sailing destinations from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are littered with the motto: "The sea is officially ours."
It is our duty to restore it."
The memory of a coastal land that was lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict is still vivid - just as the Pacific Ocean seeks to be re-floated.
These hopes are perhaps at their highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has a spirit of unity and peace, and certainly hopes for a positive outcome," said Bolivia's diplomat Roberto Callajila.
Many Bolivians will see the ICG's decision on the big screen across the country, hoping to see the tribunal in The Hague in favor of Bolivia's claim that - after decades of volatile discussions - Bolivia is obliged to negotiate to provide a comprehensive exit route to the Chilean Sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's miraculously indigenous president - who faces a contentious battle for re-election next year - has several rides in Monday's ruling.
"We are very excited to be back in the Bay Area at the end of the year.
But some analysts believe that there is little chance that the court will make a decision in favor of Bolivia - and if that happens, it will be a slight change.
The Netherlands-based UN has no power to hand over the territory of Chile, and it is determined that it will not determine the outcome of this potential story.
In international law, Chilean expert Paz Z<0xC3><0xBC>ret said the ICJ decision comes six months after the final arguments were heard, indicating that "the subject was not complicated."
The last four years have been challenging because of the pandemic.
The issue of access to the sea is being hijacked by the current Bolivian administration, Zort said.
He added that the decision by the Chinese government to release the detainees has undermined the integrity of the country's diplomatic relations.
It's hard to argue with China and the world, but it's hard to argue with that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodrigues Weltz, a representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making by the court was unusually slow.
Monday will bring "an extraordinary opportunity to unlock a new era of relations with Chile" for Bolivia and "end the 139 years of mutual differences with consensus" for Chile, he said.
Calzadia also denied that Morales - still the most popular of Latin American presidents - used the issue of the seas as a political basis.
Bolivia never gave up the right to reach the Pacific Ocean, connecting them.
The government is trying to show that they need to get out of the past.
North Korea says it will not denuclearize until it trusts the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that if he does not trust Washington, his country will not take the initiative to destroy nuclear weapons.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday.
He called upon the leaders of the two countries to implement the commitments made during the summit in Singapore.
After Singapore, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo feels the need to renegotiate a more than three-month-long stalled nuclear diplomacy with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that this is a "pipe dream" that keeps sanctions and U.S. opposition intact and will bring the North to a knee-jerk stand anytime to announce the end of the Korean War.
Pyongyang is the first to be wary of agreeing to a declaration without the implementation of a significant denuclearization move.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread suspicion that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal that the country sees as the only option for its own scheduled security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit of Kim-Trump.
The Paris Fashion Show showcases the latest style of headwear on a large scale, so the high street stays with you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or stop the sun altogether, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Browne unveiled a series of uniquely large head gear for their SS19 collection on the road, which shined the style set at the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, the high non-professional hats have made Instagram soar, and the designs below the catwalk have created an attraction in front of their eyes.
The stand-out piece by Valentino was an over-the-top badge hat, decorated by a long fan-like brim, that captured the minds of the models.
Other over-emphasized materials, including watermelon ornaments, a wonderful hat, and pineapple - but they weren't designed to keep your head cool.
Thomas Brown also revealed a selection of strange muskets - and only for Halloween's time.
Many of the colorful faces had a face-to-face CV, and the Haute Couture looked more like a Hannibal laboratory than a Couture.
One construction was found with scuba diving gear with snowballs and black glasses, while the other looked like molten ice cream cones.
And if you're looking for a high-quality print, you're in luck.
Those looking at the style speculate that the giant bonnets could make their way onto the larger roads.
The outer cap on La Bomba's high AD shoes looks attractive, with a two-foot-long brick pual hat, which is visible all the way from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The most widely circulated unprofessional hat on social media had a Commodore's label on the back, sending out a large formation underneath the catwalk - a pual beach bag that was as large as a swimming suit-wrapped model.
Raffia bag of burnt orange, cut with raffia frying, with a white leather handle on top, was a stand-out piece in the Jacuzzi La Rivera SS19 compilation in Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm hopeful that big hats and beach bags will hit the high street next summer - because the designer has created such a huge impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edwards: Essential language skills for global citizens.
Scotland's independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence and have remained uninterrupted with a set of outstanding exam results in 2018, reinforced only by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, the school, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), is providing the best level of service to its students and stakeholders.
The goal of independent schools is to prepare their students for further and higher education, to make them a career choice and to maintain their place as global citizens.
In the form of education sector, which has designed and implemented a school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language he understands, he understands."
If you speak in a language that touches his heart."
While we want to build relationships with people from other countries and build trust, this is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English.
This year's results show that the language league is at the top of the charts with the highest percentage of independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent students who studied a foreign language have achieved the higher category A.
Data collected from the 74-member school of SCIS shows that 72 percent of students have achieved the category in Medell<0xC3><0xAD>n, while 72 percent have studied German, 69 percent have studied French and 63 percent have studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will need in the future.
In independent school curriculums and elsewhere in the form of subject selection, languages are being taken up in the same way as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17% of respondents attributed language skills to a decrease in language skills for reasons given by employers struggling to fill vacant positions.
Therefore, language skills are essential to prepare more young people for their future careers.
This skill is essential in a globalised world with more potential employment opportunities for languages.
Even if they choose a career, if they learn a second language, they will get the real benefit of this kind of life-skill.
Being able to communicate directly in foreign countries will put a multilingual person in front of the competition itself.
According to a 2013 survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent were unable to communicate adequately in a foreign language and with French being the only language spoken by a two-dimensional, 15 percent.
This is why language learning is so important for today's children.
It will equip children with more than one language, especially in developing economies, with the right opportunities to find meaningful employment.
Every school in Scotland will have a different language, which teaches.
Many schools will focus on more traditional modern languages, while others will teach languages that will be considered the most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests are, there will always be many languages to choose from in independent schools, which are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are famous for providing opportunities to teach, prepare children, and divide them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In today's world of global trade, it cannot be denied that the future of the country is very important, that is why it is reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer opportunities for interest, diversity and excellence for Scotland's youth.
This should happen.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
Sunday's training for the Lakers in St. Louis
The wait for fans to see LeBron James is almost over, with Los Angeles Lakers Matt making his debut.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play a preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
It remains to be seen how many minutes the game will take.
It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on Lake's official website.
Mike Trudell, a spokesperson for the Lakers, tweeted that James would probably play for a limited number of minutes.
Earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game preseason schedule after taking the Lakers to practice.
"I don't need to be in a position to be ready for this game," he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has launched a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wyling, West Virginia.
Last week was the first of Trump's five scheduled trains to have a halt in friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote to support the Supreme Court's decision to fill the vacancies, Trump is aiming to gain support for the upcoming midterms, as the Republican Congress is in danger of losing control when it goes to vote in November.
What's the time of Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia train live stream on YouTube below.
Trump is expected to address a hearing this week of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh, who has been embroiled in a week-long FBI investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by the anti-satellite Senate confirmation vote on hold.
But the main purpose behind the excitement of the railways is to help the Republic face the November election.
So, President Trump's campaign says that the goal of these five rails next week is to "enable volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand the presence of presidents in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
Trump's campaign spokesman, who asked not to be named, said Congress' control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible because we're in a busy campaign period.
According to West Virginia Metro News, the Wesbanko Arena in Wheeling is planned, with tonight's rally "can bring in supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and take coverage from the Pittsburgh media."
This will be the second time last month that Trump visited West Virginia on Saturday, winning the state by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senator Patrick Morris, who is trailing in the election.
Simon Hyder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters: "This is not a good sign for Morris that he has to try to advance in the presidential election."
Rider Cup 2018: Team USA shows desire to keep alive in Sunday's singles
After three one-on-one sessions, only four sets of Saturday's midterms took place, which may have been a requirement for this Ryder Cup.
A pendulum swinging in motion is a completely inventive sports concept, but a player who actually believes in something like this and has never been in a competition like this since.
So, where's the momentum now?
Because it was moving all day, Jordan Spieth said, "He had a six-digit rise and now it's four, so we're giving him a little momentum."
Certainly, Europe has benefited from four points with twelve more points in the game.
As Spieth says, Americans feel that the wind is a little in their favor and they have a lot of encouragement, not in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who play together all day and each have three out of four points.
The Spirit moved from T-Green to Mold and is preceded by an example.
The festivities began with a thud as his round was underway, while A and Thomas were on the way down to the after-party, with a key putt syncing to take the four-all-stakes match into the match.
The putt that won him in the 15th match was met with the same screaming, which shows you that the US team is not out of this.
"In fact, you just dug deep and worried about your match," said Spieth.
All of these players have now retired.
18 holes to go.
The only two players with extra points in the last two days by Spieth and Thomas are Fanesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
There are four or five European countries in the world that can't be wrong.
"Mollywood" was the only pair that didn't hit the bokie on Saturday afternoon, but kept them off the bokie on Saturday morning, after nine o'clock on Friday afternoon.
A run and the way their energy flows from both sides of the ragged crowd, it seems, are the players they lost on Sunday, and there won't be any more popular players for a possible European win, so that the sun sets towards Fleetwood or Molinari than Li Golf National.
The two of them are in different hotels together.
However, the time has come to speak of European pride.
When he was paired up with Alex Noreen, Bubba Watson and the Web Simpsons hired Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, to do the little thing.
Take a bogey and two doubles on the front nine, sweep the Spaniard and the Swedes into a hole in which they will never get close to the climb.
There is no one to help you get out of the hotel on Sunday.
It is very exciting to be close to the foreball and the forefoot, as they do not take the advice that they give because of the communication between the couples and thus the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has performed well as a team, so far and on the final day have achieved a significant boost, but the forum session has shown that the team USA wants to fight, which was pleasing to some special statuses.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe improved 10-6.
With a 10-6 victory over the United States on Saturday, Europe will take advantage of the final day of the European Ryder Cup in four games.
Inspired couples Yomi Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari have taken the lead in Le Tiger National with two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods to take four points so far.
Thomas Bjorn's European side wants to preserve the Harald Trophy in Hazelta a year ago and take a 3-1 series lead over the US team in the morning in football.
In the forums, the US resisted even more, winning two matches but they could not work in the loss.
To save the trophy, Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European player to live four points at the same time, when he and Molinari dubbed "Mollywood," after a great weekend, only the second pair to live four points at their opening match in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the foreball, he was beaten by Woods and American Broyson Deshambu by another formidable 5&4.
Woods, who saw himself in two matches on Saturday, showed an impressive burst of intelligence, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in foreballs and forecourts.
Justin Rose rested for the foreballs in the morning. Dustin Johnson and Brooks came back to fellow Henrik Stenson in a 2&1 defeat to Koepka - finishing first and third in the world.
This was not the case in Europe during a pleasant festive day in the south-west of Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
He scored a superb 2&1 victory over Spain's Joan Rahm and Ian Polter in the foreballs and then hit them in a counterattack to beat the Poles and Rory McIlroy 4&3, losing two holes at the start of the forecourt.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only two teams have fought back after a loss of four points in singles, but only Furyk's side needs to pull back to retain the trophy as holders.
Two days later, on Sunday, it looks like it's going to be a different story.
"North Korea will unilaterally disarm without confidence,"" he said."
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions in the United States had deepened his distrust, and there was no way the country could unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly of the World Trade Organization (WTO) that North Korea last year took "vital measures in good faith" such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and pledging not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we did not receive any response from the US," he said.
Without any confidence in America, there would be no confidence in our national security, and in such a situation, there is no way that we first unilaterally disarm ourselves.
While Ri repeated North Korean complaints about Washingtons resistance to a nuclear-armed approach, North Korea will gradually make appropriate decisions as they will be rewarded, in a statement that seemed appropriate, this does not directly negate one-sided disarmament, as Pyongyang did in the past
When Kim resolved to work towards "decentralization of the Korean Peninsula," Ri released the first joint statement between the US President and the North Korean leader serving in Singapore on June 12, and Trump pledged North Korea's security.
North Korea has been demanding a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang should give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also opposed calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States stressed the need for ""first disarmament"" and increased the level of sanctions pressure to achieve its objective through sanctions and preventive measures, even ""rejecting the declaration of the end of the war."""
The assumption that sanctions can bring us to the knees is only a dream of people who are ignorant of us.
But the reality is that continued sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader made at the United Nations earlier in the week.
The minister highlighted three meetings in five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, saying: "It is not the party South Korea to the nuclear issue, nor would the denuclearization of the US, Korean Peninsula have come under such a stalemate."
When he was asked to the U.N., the tone of Ri's speech from then on was dramatically different from the previous year. "Mr. Evil President" Trump referred to Kim as the "Rocket Man" who is on a suicide mission after the General Assembly, which puts the U.S. mainland on the target of North Korean rockets, was essential.
Trump, who threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim at the United Nations this year for the courage to take steps for disarmament, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is free of nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit, "if it takes two years, three years, or five years - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for taking action.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Committee on Thursday: "The Security Council's sanctions must continue to be enforced strictly and without fail until we have a complete, final, certified assurance of the destruction of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 for bidding to raise funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Rein on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
"He left Pyongyang in July by saying that North Korea's progress had only taken hours to condemn it for "criminals-like-demands."
This month, North Korea vowed to destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures" at a meeting with Moon.
He said Kim told him that the "actions that he wanted" were moves to move forward to improve security and relations with Washington as Trump did in Singapore.
Harvard students are struggling to find a place to rest.
This year, Harvard University’s new course earned more than a handful of graduates to beat the growing Macho culture studied by caffeine-fueled ‘all-nitters’.
When it comes to how to take care of yourself, the children of the world's first university saw an educationist without gaitagam.
Charles Qazisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the curriculum, which he considers to be the first in the U.S.
Talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning, he was inspired to start this course.
At the end of it a girl came up to me and said: "Now, in my senior year, why am I being called this alone?"
"So far no one has told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she told the Telegraph.
The course, which is being implemented for the first time this year, explains how good sleep habits help students in the academic field and athletic performance as well as enhance their general well-being.
Paul Berrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, said the university decided to start the course after students were deprived of sleep during the week.
The cell that lasts for hours includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section features a picture of a room in a student residence, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, instructors, and books about the effects and light of caffeine, and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, and the importance of sleep time.
In the second section, participants are asked how long-term sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the complex with an interactive icon, then encouraging participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of students right away.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke a cigarette for yourself," he added.
A culture of 'all-night pulling' pride still exists, he said, adding that modern technologies and increasing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you have enough sleep with good quality should become a ‘secret weapon’ for students to cope with stress, fatigue, and anxiety – even for weight loss, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into a mode of starvation that causes them to constantly starve.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old from California who studied chemical and physical biology, took a class of them during his first year at Harvard and helped Professor Qazisler design the course.
He said that this cell opened his eyes and inspired him for a campus-wide cell.
The next step, they expect, is that all these postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study program before joining a competing institution.
Professor Kazisler recommended that students learn about the harmful effects of going to bed, as well as when to wake up, and the 'Blue Light' released by electronic screen and LED lighting systems, which can lead to sleep problems that disrupt your circadian rhythm from the killer.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The Menga Gol overtakes Gerald's men
The Rangers suffered a second battle of the distant blues as a disgruntled side due to Dolly Manga's strike losing 1 - 0 to Steven Gerrard in Livingston.
Ever since St. Johnston's 4-1 win in February, Ibrox had wanted to enter his first win on the road, but Garry Holt's team left Gerrard's second loss as manager of 18 games in his favor.
Manga hit seven minutes before half-time and there was no motivation to balance the rangers.
.When the Rangers reached sixth place, Livingston rises to third and just behind the Hibernians at a distance of the goal.
Clearly throwing an object from a distance can cause more trouble in the store for rangers after the linesman banana spruce was moved under treatment for a head injury.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side, which in the past made the year a place in the semi-finals of the Battfried Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the Levi's 11, which took a point from the Hurts last week and the way his well-drilled outfit has outwitted his opponents at every stage, has made him happy.
The Rangers may have dominated, but Livingston did a lot with the ball he had.
They only had two minutes to spare when Manga's first-ever late-off Scott Pitman sent through the goal but the midfielder grabbed his big chance.
Captain Craig Hulket was found after a deep-caged jacob free-kick but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only expand on the back post.
The Rangers took control but showed more hope than belief about his game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have been penalized on fifteen minutes as he and Steven Lawrence collided but referee Steven Thomas rejected the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers used only the first two half shots on target, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly bothered by the head of Lassa Coolibli and a weakened Ove Azaria strike.
While Livy's 34th-minute opener may have been against the run of the game, no one can deny that he alone was worthy of his welfare.
Again, the Rangers failed to work with the deep Jacobs set-piece.
Scott Airfield didn't react as Deccan Gallagher hit the ball over Scott Robinson, who kept his composure to pick up the men's singles for an easy finish.
Gerard moved on to work on the break as he swapped Coolibelly for Ryan Kent and the winger's slot at Switch Morelos provided an almost immediate impact but the impressive Kelly was blocked from his line.
But Livingston continued to play in a way that pleased the visitors to hold the visitors by hitting the long ball high with the lettuce and the helmet.
Holt's side could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood well enough to block Jacob before he came from the Lithgow corner.
A penalty was claimed on Rangers in place of Glenn Middleton as he messed up with Jacobs but again saw Thomson far away.
Tag: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page of our "Sunday Morning" calendar: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and counting...the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Geiger" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger Counter.
Since then, the mainstay of science, the gigger counter became the mainstay of pop culture as well as the seemingly impossible by starring gaiety scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the 1950 film "Balls of Cornedo."
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a gigagar counter, which is used to detect radioactive mineral such as uranium.
When you wear earphones, you can actually hear the effects given by mineral radioactivity."
Evans: "Say, he's sure he's popping!"
Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the search for his name is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'see' bad cells.
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'see' bad cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize disease cells as part of treatment.
The method involves removing the patient's immune cells, turning them into a lab.
They can then 'see' a normal protein for many cancers and are then re-injected.
One test showed promising results in many cancer patients.
A woman treated by a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize disease cells found that her uterine cancer had died within 18 months.
The method involves removing the patient's immune cells, turning them into a laboratory so that they can see the normal protein in many cancers known as HER2, then re-inserting the cells.
J. Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "increases the development of many types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lungs, and colorectal cancer," explained Prof. Bernzoski.
He has worked in a type of leukemia therapy in an approach to teaching patients how to extract immune cells and target cancer cells.
After his SNL appearance wearing a mega hat, Nye West struck out on a pro-Trump diet.
It didn't go well
Kanye West's Hurriyet was called into the studio after a thrilling performance praising his U.S. during Saturday Night Live. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing her third song of the night called Ghost Town in which she wore the Make America Great hat, she continued to fight the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
Often I talk to an American person and they say: "How do you like Trump, is he racist?"
"If I had been concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago."
SNL began the show with a skit starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made a mockery of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual harassment allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, footage of West's Rent by comedian Chris Rock was uploaded on social media.
It's unclear whether or not West was trying to joke with rock postings.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had had an adverse time wearing his headphones.
They put me in the back of the class.
"""Don't go out wearing that hat,"" he said."
They've ruined me!
According to the Washington Examiner, he said, and then they say, "I'm in a sinking place."
West went on: “Do you want to see a submerged place?’ Saying that he would “wear my Superman hat, because this means you can’t tell me what to do. You want the world to go on?”
Try to find love."
Her comments received at least twice the harrowing response from listeners, and members of the SLN were disappointed, Verity reported, with one person telling the publication there: "There was intense sannato throughout the studio."
Weston was brought in instead of singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many with the performance of the I.L.V. It song, dressed as a perrier bottle.
Weston received support from TPUSA group head Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous souls: Thank you for standing up in the crowd."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "who she is and she's absolutely wonderful."
But I didn't choose to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their "art") who I believe is embracing the ideology and speaking out against what is harmful to my community.
Its free.
So we are," she added.
Before the show, saying that he is now known as "Kenya West," rapper announced on Twitter that he has changed his name.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffie and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg's name was Snoop Lion and definitively the musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist already known as Prince.
Trying to kill me at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with murder after killing a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said that the incident took place in Balhammur.
He is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Keats Harrington strikes back at the toxic mermaid.
Jon Snow is best known for his swordwork role in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But, the 31-year-old actor has hit out at Macho Hero's stereotype, saying such roles on screen mean that young people feel they must be strong to gain respect.
More than with The Sunday Times culture, Kitt states that he believes 'something went wrong' and questioned how to overcome the toxic mermaid problem in the <0x23>metoo era.
As someone who recently married her Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, she admitted that she felt too strongly to address the issue.
I feel personally, very strongly at this moment - where have we done anything wrong with masculinity?
"What are we teaching men in the context of the problem we want them to be when they're growing up?"
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for an increase in toxic manhood due to its male characters.
He continued: 'What is birth and what is taught?
What is it that is taught on TV and in the streets, that young boys think this should be a certain part of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time - how can we change that?
"Something has obviously gone wrong for young men."""
He is tired of fighting and horses, he admitted in an interview that he will not be doing any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when he arrives at the end of next summer.
Sam Shepard's True West's comeback from the November kit will feature the lead actor in the film which is the story of the filmmaker and his brother, who are robbers.
The actor recently revealed that he is considering meeting his wife Rose as the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
He said, 'I met my wife on this show, so she gave me my future family and my life here.'
Rose played the character Yigrett related to the love of Kit's character Jon Snow in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property location in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China records 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, health officials say.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases, which marked a change from the past, were induced by sex.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in large parts of China as a result of infectious blood infections.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health officials said the number of people infected with HIV had fallen to almost zero.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was discouraged in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be severe.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases are transmitted due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised the holistic use of HIV drugs as part of an effort to solve this problem.
Maxine Waters denied that the employee had leaked the G.O.P. Senator’s data, blasts ‘dangerous falsehoods’ and ‘conspiracy theories’.
U.S. Rep. Maxson Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of his staff posted personal information of three Republican American senators on the members' Wikipedia profile.
The Los Angeles Democrat asserts that the claims were handled by "ultra-right wing" pundits and websites.
Lies, lies, and even more despicable lies, voters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information transmitted includes the home address and phone number for U.S. Sens. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utah.
The information, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, appeared online on Thursday.
The three were released after being questioned by the senators.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to Waters' office and published information on a member of the water staff, Hill said.
These unfounded accusations are a complete lie and a complete lie, Waters continued.
My staff member - whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - is in no way responsible for leaking this information.
"These allegations are completely false and a complete lie."
The statement quickly sparked online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Eric Fleischer.
"It's infuriating," Fitzgerald said.
This indicates that she is not likely to become a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they don't get angry.
They should not be rewarded.
They must not question the motives of the accused.
They need to be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer was comparing voters' reaction to Kavanaugh's criticism of Democrats, who were accused by critics of being angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro also expressed his views on Twitter to unite voters in the mid-term elections.
"If it's the truth, it's the truth," he said.
In her statement, Waters said her office had "warned the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent claims."
We will ensure that the perpetrators are disclosed, and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to me and any members of any staff."
John's English Strikes Again review downplayed Rowan Atkinson's spoof.
It's now traditional to see the importance of Brexit in any new film with British Slant and it applies to the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and was re-introduced to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will we be self-loathing about what kind of new export opportunities we have in the country?
At any rate, bare-faced, rubber-like face at the front, Johnny English has the license to recreate anything a second time - although the name of its allusion is more than anything that it's a broad comical composition designed for a non-English - cinematic areas.
He's definitely a skilled secret agent who, despite his bizarre impersonation, Mr. Bean's dash and a doll from that boy have found little clues in the riots of fire theme tunes at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
It was originally based on Atkinson, a traveler and international man of mystery who once played Barclaycard in TV advertising, leaving chaos in his wake.
This is one or two of the most beautiful flowers on the outside.
I loved Johnny English when he approached the helicopter, when he was dressed in a medieval armor and the rotor blade was wrapped against his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy is on display, but the humour makes it feel very low and awkward, especially as "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedy as their own self-confident component.
The humor seems to have been created for younger kids rather than adults, and for me, John's wasted adventures in English aren't as focused as Atkinson's silent-movie gigs in the exploration and personalization of Bean.
Now the best local support is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's spy super-secret web network, exposing the identities of agents across the UK in the field, for the agent's fall on duty - a regrettable small role for Kevin Alden.
: This is the last moment for a Prime Minister who is a stubborn and embracer who is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson works very well with this Quixi-Teresa-Me character but there is nothing special in the script to work with.
Her secret advisers notified her that as every active detective had compromised, she would have to bring someone out of retirement.
This means fighting John's English on its own, which is now operating as a school-master in a posh establishment, but how the off-the-records evidence of being an undercover operative: Here are some good gigs, because the rock-type of English espionage is one-of-a-kind.
The English are sent back to Whitefowl for immediate briefing and reunited with his long-suffering former buff, played again by Ben Miller.
Buff is a married male, modeled on a submarine commander, a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which Vicky Peppa Pigdine is a little useless.
So Batman and Robin Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in the action of getting very wrong, fighting off Olga Kuryalenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Karishma is in a terrible collapse in the clutches of the tech billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain's computer troubles: Sinful Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and bogey begin their Farceal high jinx odyssey, assuming the servant's disguise, they set fire to a flash game restaurant; they are smuggled aboard Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure chaos as the headset attempts to familiarize itself with the interior of Volta's home a veritable reality.
All the obstacles have been taken back for a final order, but as it is adequate and fun, there is very little children's TV about the whole thing.
Beautiful medium sized material.
And I can't help but think about other Johnny English films that happen: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson the role that really does justice to his talent?
Labour rejects, it prepares a plan for Britain to work a four-day week but pays for five days.
The Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party is on the verge of considering a revolutionary plan in which Britons will work four days a week - but will receive payments for five days.
The party reportedly wants that the boss of the company should pass on the savings made by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to the employees so that they can be given more days.
It will see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still take home the same amount of pay.
Sources said the idea would "fit" with the party's economic agenda and plan to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The trade union Congress has supported a four-day week to take advantage of the changing economy for workers.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected to be released before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight but the four-day working week is an aspiration that fits with the party's approach of rebalancing the economy in favour of the workers as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Green Party will not be the first party to support the idea of a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this desire is not currently supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not being considered by the party.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to put aside his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to get back power from "faceless directors" and "professors" in utility companies.
The shareholders in the water companies will not be able to get back their entire stake as the Labour Government can make 'deductions' on the basis of alleged misappropriation.
He also endorsed plans to create Inclusive Owners' Funds to put employees on company boards and hand over 10 percent of private-sector companies' equity to employees, which stand to pay out from an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Linde Graham, John Kennedy speak "60 Minutes" about whether Kavanaugh's investigation by the FBI could change his mind
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and the Bureau's findings raise the question of whether any Republican senator could be forced to support it.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republicans Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham, could the FBI find anything that would inspire him to change his mind?
Canada seemed to be more free than its partner from South Carolina.
Kennedy said, "I mean, of course."
I said, I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After this incident I called him, he got away with the accusation, he said, 'Did you do that?'
He was determined, determined, and outstanding."
Graham's vote, however, appears to be located in stone.
"My mind is about Brett Kavanaugh and he's going to accuse Dynamite," he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it strongly, Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And not one of them could verify his name, which he gave to them.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday the New York Global Citizen Festival will host an annual music festival, with a very impressive line-up of artists and a similarly impressive goal; the end of world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring thousands of people to Central Park's Great Lawn, not only to enjoy the acts of Mazon Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the goal of the ceremony to end alcohol poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, an area of the Global Poverty Project, is an international advocacy group that seeks to end poverty by actively increasing the number of people fighting against it.
To receive a free ticket to the ceremony (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), musicians had to complete a series of tasks, or "works," such as e-mailing a world leader, calling, or other meaningful measures to help raise awareness of their own goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal for 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free program of music a real way to persuade people to call for action, or is that just another case of so-called "clickTVism" - people believing that they're making the right difference by signing an online application or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, emphasizing various goals.
These actions have inspired world leaders to announce pledges and policies worth more than $37 billion to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and declarations thrown out of its operations, of which at least $10 billion has been disbursed or funds raised.
The group estimates that the safe fund has so far directly affected about 649 million people worldwide.
The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and bureaucrats, is committed to "helping children grow to their full potential" after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens promising $35 million in aid to end malnutrition in the country.
In April 2018, Tracy Ullman, the Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition, told a group assembled in London, "On behalf of the UK government, with your support, as do donors, national governments, and global citizens alike, we can make the social injustice of undernourishment a footnote in history."
The group also said that after more than 5,000 steps were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a project The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children suffering from malnutrition.
In response to a FAQ on its website, "What do you think we can do to end acute poverty?"
The global citizen replied: "It will be a long and arduous road - sometimes we will fall and fail."
But, like the great civil rights and anti-racism movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janet Mona New York are some of the acts involved in this year's event, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Russian may use U.S. Navy for blockade to block energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington can take the help of its navy if necessary to prevent clashes in Russian energy markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleged that Russia's annexation of Syria - significantly where it is operating at the invitation of the Vaidya government - is a hypothetical to explore new energy markets.
"I think it's because they're in the Middle East that they want the power of the broker as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to resolve it.
"The United States has the capability of our Navy, and if needed, to block, the sea route is open to ensure that its energy does not enter the market," he said.
He was addressing the attendees at a ceremony organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization and which has identified itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, and he noted that they were almost identical.
He described Russia as a "terrible sea-based economy," saying that "the economic alternative to Iran and Russia is, to a lesser extent, to take advantage of and to an alternative to fuel."
The statement comes as the Trump administration is working to increase its export of liquefied natural gas (LPG) instead of Russia for consumers in European countries.
To accomplish that, officials in the Trump government, including US President Donald Trump, tried to get Germany out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Russia has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is ready to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a full-fledged economic project.
Russia argues that the U.S.'s sharp opposition to the project is purely for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, "I believe we are of the view that energy can never be a means to use pressure and consumers have the right to choose suppliers."
Germany has not wavered from the US stance and it has reiterated its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the US to withdraw from a bilateral agreement between European Energy Policy and Berlin and Moscow.
After the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) Dieter Kampf said, "I have a great objection to the third country interfering in our energy supply."
The Massachusetts Senator says that Elizabeth Warren will take a "tough stance" in the running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take a "strict stance" in the running for president after the midterm elections.
In the town hall in Massachusetts, Holliday confirmed that the Running for President would be held.
According to The Hill newspaper, it's time for women to fix our broken government by invading Washington and the top of it is women.
After November 6, I will take a strong stance in the running for president.
During the Warren Town Hall, President Donald Trump showered rain on him and said he was "taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm ashamed of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have openly criticized the war.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We have to conduct an FBI investigation before voting."
However, in a survey released on Thursday, most of Warren's candidates do not think that Warren should be running for president in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of "probably" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not take the step.
Thirty-three percent supported the measure.
The survey found support in a 38 percent collaboration with former governor Dave Patrick, who further supported the run, and 48 percent in opposition.
Other high-profile Democratic names that have landed in discussion in the context of a possible 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press report, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin cites track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
The 26-year-old spent a year in the military in Iraq in September.
He was arrested in connection with a domestic violence case on Monday night.
At a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Sarah told the audience about Donald, saying, "What my son is going through, what he is going through after returning, I can understand the pain of the families of the soldiers who are suffering from PTSD and some of the wounded who have returned."
Describing his arrest as "an elephant in the room," Palin said of his son and the senior soldiers who had returned from the other wars, "They've changed, they've become stubborn, they're surprised to see their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military giving back what they've given to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, she was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska on charges of domestic violence and for interfering in domestic violence cases and possessing intoxicated weapons.
The DCs of 18 states have supported the challenge against the new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy, denying victims of gang or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-court filing in Washington on Friday to support the asylum-seekers challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The complainant's full name is Grace V. The Sessions Suit filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against Federal Policy has not been disclosed.
She was tortured by her partner and members of her violent gang, but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers for the states supporting Grace wrote to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which has raised a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as the country faces widespread problems of gang and domestic violence.
The new U.S. Asylum Policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum against domestic violence.
Columbia District Attorney General Carl Reissy said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades-old state, federal and international law."
Federal law requires that all acelum claims be decided subject to certain facts and circumstances, and such a statute violates that principle, the Find-of-Court said in a brief.
Attorneys further argued that the policy denying immigrants entry shocked the U.S. economy, which was working to become their entrepreneurs and provide "essential labor supplies."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to provide asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence.
The sessions announced the policy on June 11 and said that asylum is available for those who leave the country of their motherland due to fear of membership of a particular social group or political opinion, caste, religion or nationality.
Asilum did not mean to eliminate all the problems, all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescue efforts have been intensified to find the survivors, who have doubled the number of deaths in Palu.
The situation was much worse for the survivors.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who consoles her traumatized child at an evacuation centre in Palu city, said, "It's very stressful.
Every few minutes, an ambulance takes the body to the morgue.
There is a lack of clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up things lying in the water and trying to save whatever they found.
Hundreds of injured and a 7.5-magnitude earthquake in Andhra, as in hospitals, was felt.
One of the injured, Dwayne Harris, suffered a broken back and shoulder and was resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, as patients were often treated there due to strong aftershocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recalled those moments in the fifth-floor room of the hotel, which was shaken by a massive earthquake with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
Harris, who was in the city for a family wedding, told the Associated Press: “I thought I was buried under the rubble of the hotel.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then there was no sound.
I don't know what happened to my wife and children.
I hope they are safe."
US ambassador accuses China of 'threatening' with 'propaganda aids'
A four-page announcement in a government Chinese newspaper in the U.S. citing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, came a week after the U.S. ambassador accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday – referring to a supplement to the announcement of the China Daily’s Des Moines Register, the state’s best-selling newspaper – accused of interfering in the November 6 U.S. Congress election, which China rejected.
Trump has alleged that China tried to interfere in the US elections, US officials told Reuters, a new phase of sharpening the US campaign of increasing pressure on China has begun.
It is common for foreign governments to resort to advertising to promote trade, but China and the United States are currently in the throes of a trade war, and both have imposed new tariffs on each other's imports.
At the start of the trade war, Chinese and US experts said the tariffs were designed to target exporters in states such as Lova and support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, who was a long-time governor of Lova, China's main exporter of agricultural goods, said China has caused the loss of American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an op-ed on Sunday in the Des Moines Register: "China is now trying to scare us twice as much by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
Branstad wrote that "to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of America's glorious tradition of freedom of speech and expression to print a paid ad in the Des Moines Register."
"Contrary to that, in the Chinese newspaper world you will hear limited anti-Sooro and you will not see a true reflection of the dissenting opinion of the Chinese people on China's worried economic flow, because the media is in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added, “A leading newspaper in China turned down an offer to publish its article. ” He did not, however, name the newspaper.
Analysts warn that the Republican is harassing women voters ahead of mid-term elections by defending Kavanaugh
While standing with and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in a case of multiple allegations of sexual assault, the analyst has warned that the party will face disapproval, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The feelings surrounding the subject have been extremely heavy, and most Republicans are already saying they want to move on with the referendum.
In an article published in The Hill on Saturday by Grant Rieher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, he said that these things can no longer be taken back.
"""I don't think last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for the FBI investigation can attract angry voters,"" Rehr said."
Karen Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser to the progressive group MoveOn and national spokesman, told the Washington D.C. newspaper on Friday that "women should not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, and they will not forget November."
Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee pushed forward Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, saying during a protest in the Senate's hallway on Friday morning that protesters said "November is coming!" Protesters said "November is coming!"
Nonpartisan political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site, "Democrat's enthusiasm and motivation have soared.
People say that enthusiasm is already there, and it's true.
But it may be swinging higher among female voters, especially in smaller cities and among young voters aged 18-to-29, when they don't like the president, they don't vote often."
Before giving details of allegations of sexual assault against the nominee of the Supreme Court in Ford's public testimony, analysts suggested that there could be a backlash if Republicans go ahead with the confirmation.
According to former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele, "This has become a confusing puzzle for the GOP.
It's not just about the committee's opinion on whether or not to put Kavanaugh on the bench, it's also about the way Republicans have handled the whole issue and the way they've dealt with the complainants," Guy Cecil, director of group priorities USA for electing Democrats, told the news channel.
However, following the agreement of Fords and Kavanaugh, the American people may be somewhat divided by going further towards it.
The new poll found that 41 percent of respondents believed certain or perhaps Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they were certain they were with Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh may or may not have lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
The Guardian reports that after pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had assaulted him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez has alleged that the Supreme Court nominee had exposed her secret to him at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventors of the World Wide Web for Google and Facebook are planning to launch a new Internet
Team Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Technology Legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that is building Berners-Lee's open source platform by solidifying it.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what information to allow access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose behind Intrap was "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
Its a historic moment.
This app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
This may include a contact list, a to-do list, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify and is available on the same browser and everywhere at the same time.
The unique thing about a personal online data store is that it's entirely up to the user to decide what kind of information he or she wants to give access to.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inerrupt is to provide the company with the resources, process, and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
At present, the company has signed an agreement with some of the staff developers and volunteers of the security platform Bruce, bought by IBM by Berns-Lee, to work on the project.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the InRep website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were "talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make complete changes to where all of their business models stand overnight."
We dont need their permission.
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "aim is to provide professional energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, when the World Wide Web Consortium was established at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berns-Lee revolutionized the Internet.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
I'm extremely hopeful for the next era of this web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Celebrating the WW1 Victoria Cross Clarique
The only church in England to have won the Victoria Cross in World War I has been celebrating its 100 years in the city.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard Vaughan won the award in the attack on Bellanglais and Lehcourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by snipers four days later and no one knew after that that he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vaughan, said it was a "brilliant symbol," a monument his grandfather's award-winning feat would proclaim for nearly 100 years.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Wayne led his battalion towards the Canal de Saint-Quentin "with great smog and heavy gunfire from field and machine guns."
He later reached the firing line and proceeded to run alone with a field-gun with "heavy bravery" and exited in three detachments.
One month before the end of the war, Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918.
Michael Vaughan, 72, said his grandfather's work was "something I knew I could never do but it made me something humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Wan, also laid wreaths after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said he "felt very honoured to participate in the parade" and added that "the support provided by many is a testament to the bravery of a real hero."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Ballator 206, instead of getting a Peppa Pig.
Imagine, you're staying up all night to watch a pack of Bellator 206 to refuse to watch the main event.
San Jose's bill includes 13 fights, including six on the main card and being shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., Ggaard Musasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other and instead the coverage turned into a Peppa Pig when viewers in the UK were stunned.
Some of them didn't wake up until the next morning because they didn't know what was going to happen.
A fan on Twitter described the cartoon as a "sick joke."
When asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications, said, "The government rule is that for 6 p.m. that content wasn't appropriate so they had to go on children's programming.
The Peppa Pig, "Yes."
Scott Cocker, chairman of the Ballet Company, said he would work on his schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably do that," Koker said.
But it was a Sunday morning at six o'clock in the morning and this time of ours on Sunday and Monday in this way, we can not do this work.
But we are working on it.
I mean, when the switch is over, a lot of the writing goes back and forth and it doesn't feel good.
We tried to fix it and we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I promise you this will not happen again.
We're going to keep it five fights instead of six as usual and we tried to deliver more for the fans and we just went over the top.
It is a bad situation."
Dessert Island Discs: Tom Daley experiences 'namaste' over sex
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he seemed to be jinxed in front of everyone because of his sexuality - but that inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize "not everyone is like me" until he went to secondary school.
Speaking on the First Radio 4 Desert Island Disc presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he talked about gay rights to bind people to "hope."
He also said that being a parent pays less attention to winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter of the long-running show, has been ill for several months.
Appearing as Castaway on Laverne's first program, Daly said she felt "more deficient than anyone" in them because "it's not socially acceptable for boys and girls to pick up."
He said: "To this day, those who have felt inferior to others and have felt different from others, those feelings have actually given me the strength and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," so he didn't disappoint anyone when he learned about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and has called for an end to homosexuality in more countries using her appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said he spoke because he considers himself lucky to have found a way to live without compromises and that he wants to "build hope" for others.
The three-time world champion reportedly fell in love with US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, with whom he "suddenly caught me" in a 2013 interview.
Daly married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but he said the age difference was never an issue.
When you go through a lot of good-feast events at such a young age - he competed in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later. He said it was hard to find someone who has had the same good-feast experiences.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Dale in June, and Daly said it had only changed his "whole perspective" of life.
If you had asked me last year, 'I want to win a gold medal' was all that.
You know what's bigger than an Olympic gold medal?
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie."
His son's name is similar to his father Robert, who died at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer in 2011.
Daly said his father didn't want to die and finally said that if he still had a ticket for London 2012 - he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that you couldn't sit in a row wearing a pad," he said.
I was sitting by holding his hand until he really stopped breathing. Dad died and I finally accepted that he was not invincible, he said.
The following year, Daly competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
I found out that this is the dream of my life - there is no particular feeling of having to dive in front of a crowd of domestic spectators at the Olympic Games.
He also deliberately chose his first song Heather Small's Pride song, the song that came to work to build a samurai at the Olympics and still thrills him.

Out-of-form Michaelson was sitting on a bench of the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to regain form to avoid becoming an unhappy milestone.
Michaelson is going to play in the biennial event for the 12th time, he was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's foreballs and forearms.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, it is often done for the United States, instead of being in the middle of a five-time major action as he has done repeatedly for the United States.
The 48-year-old isn't ideal for a tight-leaved golf national course when there aren't even fairly straight drivers at the peak of his career, where long rough plains routinely sentence him to a false shot.
And if the course itself isn't too tough, Michaelson faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who has paired with Toki Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans go down four points in 12 singles matches, Michaelson's match could be crucial enough to end before the competition starts.
He had a lot of confidence in his players and he had nothing else to say.
"Today he understood his role very well, he patted me on the back, wrapped his hands around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's been a big part of the team in the past and this week.
I didn't think I'd be able to play two games.
I wanted to do more, but I thought we had to do what we had to do.
He wants to be there just like everyone else."
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record with the Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It can make the end of a Ryder Cup career memorable that never matches the height of his personal record.
Although Michaels has 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven half-centuries at home, Furyk said his presence has communicated some invincible power to the team.
It's funny, it's funny, it's witty, it's witty, it likes to make fun of people and it's a noble person to be in a team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players can have fun with it, it's been fun to watch it this week.
There's a lot more to it than just playing."
Europe's captain, Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn, knows that the big lead will be revealed at any time.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that the gigantic lead up to the last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an upset.
Dan began his career with a match at Velederama in 1997, with side captain Seve Ballesteros taking a five-point advantage against the Americans, but narrowly narrowly avoiding a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 nose to reach the final line.
You keep reminding yourself that we had a huge lead in Valedarama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and Valedarama where we won, too, only to have both won 5-3 on Friday after watching the 2018 class and 10-6 at Golf National yesterday, Bjorn said.
"History will show us and our team that time has not passed.
You're going to be sorely missed tomorrow.
Go out there and do the right thing.
This will not be completed until there are points on the board.
Our goal is to try and win this trophy and that's where the focus is.
I've said all along that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but on the other hand there are great players in the world that we also know very well."
Looking at the way his players have performed on the Toff golf course adds to the excitement, saying: "I never put myself ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different animal.
Tomorrow's show will be different and it will be a different story.
It's great with a partner when everything is going well, but when you have to show performance in person, your ability as a golfer is fully tested.
The only message you need to get to the players is that tomorrow you have to give your best.
Now, you have to leave your partner behind and give him the best on his own as well as your own."
Contrary to Bjorn, rival Jim Furyk would expect to perform better individually than his partner, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, from the rest of the players, excluding those who had picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself has tasted both defeat and victory, opening up Europe's "Miracles at Medinah" and was part of Brooklyn's winning team before coming out as a loser.
In response to a question on how captain Ben Crenshaw had led his players in the last days in 1999, he said, "I remember every word of it."
We've got 12 important matches tomorrow, but you've got to get off to a quick start, as you've seen in Medinah, in Brooklyn.
When the momentum moves in one direction, there is a lot of pressure in the middle matches.
Let's set up our line-up accordingly and put the players in a design that we think we can show some magic tomorrow."
Thomson is tasked with advancing the game and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Raheem, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter will face other Europeans in the top half order.
"I went to this group in this order because I think it covers everything," said the second of the singles' selections.
Germany's new warship was postponed again.
The Cold War-era frigate was due to be replaced by the German Navy's newest frigate in 2014, but due to faulty systems and heavy cost, it could not be launched until next year, local media reported.
A military spokesman said the flagship ship of the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates, the "Reinland-Pfalz" brand, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The vessel was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the controversial post-delivery issue had undermined the future of the ambitious project.
In 2007, the Navy ordered four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class vessels to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to have a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technologies such as radar, infrared, and acoustic signature.
Other important features include its long maintenance period - new frigates from home ports must be put in place for up to two years.
However, the continued delay means that the Cutting-Edge Warships should have been able to show Germany's power abroad but will be outdated by the time it arrives in service, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated F-125 frigate became headlines last year when the German Navy refused to officially approve the ship and sent it back to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time the Navy had sent the ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was said about the reasons behind sending the ship back, but German media referred to some of the important "software and hardware shortcomings" that render the warships sent on war missions useless.
The software's shortcomings in particular were important because the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class battleships would be powered by as many as 120 sail crews, with this manpower only half as much as the manpower on older Bremen class frigates.
Moreover, it has also been revealed that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Pfalz is thought to be as heavy as ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that the initial cost of the project increased from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion).
The problem of new frigates has become especially important in view of the recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the Defense Committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the Navy was actually "going through a shortage of deployment-capable ships."
The official said the issue was heating up over time as the old ships were scrapped but no vessels were delivered.
He said that no one from the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigate was able to join the navy.
National Trust Evesdrops on Secret Life of Bets
The new research being conducted on real estate in the Scottish Highlands is aimed at exploring how bats use the landscape in search of food.
It is hoped that these findings will shed new light on the behavior of flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will include common and soprano pipestrels in Wester Ross' Inverve gardens, as well as brown long-eared and doubenton bats.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out a mobile survey using hand-holding detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's voice and what species are doing.
Then a living map and report will be prepared to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dever, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help better determine the benefits such as the creation of grasslands and how best to preserve woodlands for bats and other related species.
There has been a significant decline in bat populations over the past century in Scotland and across the UK.
They are threatened by building and development works that damage their routes and habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, with some chemical treatment of flypapers and building materials as well as attacks from pet cats.
Cats aren't really blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey due to their nocturnal hunting habits.
They use a modern eco-location technique to point out flaws and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks in the country and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, inspect resting places and sometimes carry out rescue operations.
The organization has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve area in the Threeway Estate in Drumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says the estate is an ideal area for him.
We have developed a good area for bats here in Thiruvananthapuram, he said.
We've got old buildings, lots of old trees, and very good Habitats.
But there's still a lot about those bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about how to move forward."
He stressed the importance of testing bats before conducting maintenance in the property as the potential unwanted destruction of the single-breasted snatching could lead to the extinction of 400 females and young bats, possibly the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, or harass them or destroy their roosts.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish officer at the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged people to help.
"We still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of its species, we don't even know how their population is growing," she said.
Prosecutors rejected Ronaldo's claim of rape with a claim to German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape claims against him "fake news," with Ronaldo saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, making allegations to this magazine.
In 2009, in a hotel room in Las Vegas, Portugal and Juventus forward Ronaldo is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga.
He is accused of paying $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after the claim was reported, addressing Ronaldo's 14.2 million fans in an Instagram live video, the 33-year-old described the reports as "fake news."
No, no, no, no, no.
What they've printed today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo said in front of the camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
And thats normal.
They want to be famous by printing my name, but that's just part of the business.
"I'm very happy and all is well," said Rooney.
Lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, a report they have called "unfair reporting of suspicion in the area of privacy."
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said: "The player will be compensated for damages to the moral image consistent with the severity of the infringement, which is perhaps the most serious violation of individual rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to papers filed in Nevada's Clark County District Court, after meeting in the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her by doing an act against creation.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good person" and only "one percent" demented.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but it was done by mutual consent.
Mayorga has also claimed that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to settle out of court because she "feared the change" and was "concerned to be humiliated in public."
The 34-year-old Meirga says she now wants to cancel the settlement as she is constantly shocked by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged molestation, and this summer in a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million went to the Italian giants Juve.
Brexit: The UK will "forever regret" for losing its status as a carmaker
If the UK loses its status as the world's leading car maker after Brexit, it "will regret it forever," business secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "important" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnston near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal," Mr Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of the no-deal Brexit event could hurt jobs.
Toyota's Orys and Avensis made 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the European Union.
"I think if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we'll see our factories shut down," Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota at Bernstein, said.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concern about fears of leaving the EU, including how cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, will operate without an agreement.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its mini plant a month after Brexit in Oxford.
In the case of no-deal Brexit, car manufacturers say that the risk of supply chain is a major concern.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis for orders of cars coming from both the UK and the European Union and parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there could be disruption at the border and, according to industry, it could lead to a shortage of parts and delays.
The company said that it is not possible to keep more than one day's worth of Toyota inventory at its Derbyshire plant, so production will be stopped.
Mr Clark said the Theresa May checkers plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely designed to avoid checks on the border."
"He told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, ""We need a deal. We want to make the best deal, to grab this opportunity 4 with success at present."
Evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers says we need to be fully able to continue the hugely successful chain of supply chains.
It is not possible to say how long the Toyota production will be closed but as production will be stopped for a long time, he warned that the additional cost will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately pose a risk to jobs.
Peter Sovellaris, who has worked at Burnston for 24 years and is a United Nations convener at the plant, said the concern of its members was growing: "In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they will never come back.
"We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU," the government spokesman said.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed, says White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "will be postponed for another week" as a dispute over nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues in the Supreme Court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, relations between the Trump supporter and Russia, and a potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not, and whether or not this will threaten Mueller's independence, gossip has been going on in the streets of Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein wore wires to record conversations with Trump and discussed the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein, however, denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, according to reports, he resigned.
Instead of a meeting with Trump, who would be at the United Nations in New York was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he "doesn't like" to fire Rosenstein but delayed the meeting to avoid a clash with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that took the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of misconduct and sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh, with further delays in the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "It's not set a date, it could be this week, I think the Supreme Court will be back in action for another week."
We're going to keep an eye on it and I'm going to keep the press informed."
Some journalists objected that Sanders had not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Chrissy Teigen explains why this is happening.
Sanders said the reason for not briefings was not to "make TV reporters angry", adding that "I don't disagree with the fact that they are offended."
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"She said the current president has had more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president." She added without giving evidence: "We know the numbers."
Sanders said the briefing would still take place, but "if the press had a chance to ask the president of the United States a direct question, it would be many times better than talking to me."
We try to do that and we've seen a lot of that over the last few weeks and you can talk to the President of the United States when the press briefing is held."
Trump regularly answers reporters' questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or attending press conferences with visitors.
However, a single press conference will be held.
This week in New York, the president may have said why reporters had assumed a strange situation and behaved recklessly before they had gathered.
The Health Secretary has written to EU employees in NHS Scotland about the fear of Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to the EU staff to express the country's gratitude to the staff working in the NHS in Scotland and wished they would continue post-Brexit.
GA’s Freeman MSP sent the letter less than six months after the UK’s exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to meeting the costs of applying permanent status for EU citizens employed in its dedicated public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman writes: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the exit were going on and this led to the expected decision by the autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in its preparation for a possible no-deal situation.
I know this is a difficult time for all of us.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate that I attach great importance to the contribution of every member of the staff irrespective of their nationality.
Co-workers from all over the European Union have provided their valuable experience and expertise and it has strengthened the work of healthcare and has benefited the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Kristen Abercrombie has undergone an immediate surgery after a serious head injury.
According to a report by Tennessee's Mike Organ, Vanderbilt suffered an emergency surgery after a severe head injury to linebacker Kristen Abercrombie during Saturday's 31-27 defeat to Commodores.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred a short time ago.
"He fell to the side and collapsed there," Reid said.
The trainers and medical staff gave him the abercrombie oxygen before putting it on the stretcher and took it for further investigation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harrison of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that the surgery was performed at the Vanderbilt Medical Center in Abercrombie.
Harris added that "no details of the type or proportion of the injury have yet to be found" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
This is his first season with Tennessee State since Redshirt sophomore Abercrombie transferred from Illinois.
On Saturday, he made a total of five tackles before leaving the game, with a total of 18 tackles of his season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a high stamp duty when buying property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty to purchase the property to help the homeless with additional cash under the new tory plan using extra cash in the UK.
This step will neutralise the success of Corbyn's drive to attract young voters
There will be an increase in stamp duty on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects that it will be able to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year in this way to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers while buying property in the UK will have to pay higher stamp duty with the extra cash used to help the homeless, which Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's drive to target younger voters with more affordable housing and heavier earnings.
To speed up the government's campaign of additional money to combat rough sleeping, an increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK.
Surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, which may include a high level introduced two years ago on the sale of a second home and purchase and may be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects this to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London's wealth is bought by non-UK residents, which increases prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to take home a home.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers and they spend most of their time outside the country.
Boris Johnson has asked for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of overspending on land to keep property prices high, and Theresa May urged them to leave quotas on cheap homes to fix Britain's "housing disarray."
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and the vacating of "no-fault" possession.
It wants to give more power to the committee to build new houses.
"Last year I said I would dedicate my Premiership to restoring the British dream that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means we're going to fix the broken housing market.
"The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and make a living here."
However, it's hardly fair that hard-working UK residents are as easy to buy a home as those who don't live in the UK and work at overseas companies.
Many people dream of buying a house and sleeping in a rented house is becoming a reality."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate quest" is to become a Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scott is taking up the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently third in League One, with three points in the top.
After guiding St. Mirren back to last season's Scottish Premiership, he disappeared from the stadium this summer.
I wanted to play for my country.
I got a B-cap," Ross told BBC Scotland's SportSports.
But I grew up watching Scotland play at Hampden with my father as a child, and that's what always keeps me going back.
If I get the chance, I'll be able to manage the team."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he doesn't find it awkward to follow such established names at such a large club, having previously rejected proposals from Burnsley and Ipswich Town.
"If I can take this club back to the Premier League, can I get success at this moment?"
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, he is undoubtedly placed in the Premier League," he said.
It's not an easy task to get there, but if I can take the club back there, I'll see myself succeed here.
Ross has only been in his management career for three years, at Dumbarton he has worked for 15 months as assistant boss and heart's coaching staff.
He then helped Aloua regain his three-tier reputation, and in the following season won the championship title to St. Mirren.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton's Academy.
He took care of Elijah's affairs, saying, "It was probably the right life curve.
I really believed that management was more suitable for me than playing.
It seems odd because I've done the right thing, lived the right life out of it, and enjoyed some of the right motives.
But it can be difficult to play.
On a weekly basis, you have to see a lot of things.
I'm still going through that work pressure and load but the management seems to be quite right.
I always wanted to manage and now that I do it, it feels the most comfortable for me all my life."

The exact time for the pint is 5.30 pm on Saturday, the survey said.
The summer heatwave has increased earnings for Britain's struggling pub but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars reported a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July, but restaurants saw a 4.8 per cent drop in revenue.
Peter Martin of business consultancy CGA, which compiled these figures, said: "England's long-term participation in the World Cup due to the heat of the constant sun and the expected participation in the World Cup continued its June previous month pattern in July, with pubs growing by 2.8 percent, while restaurants hit more hard.
The decline of 1.8 per cent in restaurant sales in June was even worse in July.
As much as restaurants went down in sales, drinks-based pubs and bars did excellent business.
Food-based pubs also suffered heat losses, although they were not as severe as restaurant operators.
This means that people just want to go out for drinks.
Sales of drinks in managed pubs and bars rose 6.6 per cent month-on-month, while food sales fell by three per cent."
Lessure and Hospitality Analyst R.S.M. Paul Numan said: "These results are consistent with the trend since the end of April.
The weather and the effects of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in an outdoor market.
It is not surprising that despite the ongoing struggle of restaurant groups, the continued annual sales decline of 4.8 percent will leave a worse impact, especially on ongoing price pressures.
"Long hot summers should not be a bad time for the food industry and now only time will tell how much relief we will get from the moderate temperatures we experience in August."
The total sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, stood at 2.7 per cent in July, showing a slow decline in brand roll-outs.
The coffee pitch tracker monitors the industry's sales for the UK's pub, bar and restaurant sector and captures and analyzes data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is an established industry benchmark.

There is a growing fear in the news that sex-related content is being posted in it.
20% of students said they had a "major" account to show their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, has a private social media account that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapidly growing "fake Insta" page - in regards to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
There is a growing fear in the news that content related to sex is being posted in it.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show parents when they also had a second private account.
When a mother saw her 13-year-old daughter's mysterious site being hacked, the teenager urged others to "rape" her.
Research by Digital Awareness UK and Independent Schools' Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half having a private account.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "Disrupting a lot of teens they find online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eliud Doyle will be "the voice for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Doyle has been elected as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and Chairman Ian Beatty has described the move as a great opportunity for guidance seekers to leverage his extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
"Alidha holds wide respect in the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are confident that Scotland's athletics will benefit greatly from her by bringing her on board.
Doyle said: "I look forward to working as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute to Scotland and guide the game."
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 games in Atlanta, had a total of four Olympic golds and now a regular BBC pundit, unable to walk due to a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I had to deal with a stroke.
I could not walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell how much I will be able to recover.
It's been a long time since I've been able to do anything, but I've learned how to do it, and I'm still learning how to do it, and I'm still learning how to do it!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
There is a difference of opinion online in breast pump advertising compared to mothers' cows
The breast pump company has shared an online opinion with the ad and compared cow's milk care from mothers.
To launch the so-called "world's first silent wearable breast bump," consumer tech company Alvy released a tung-in-cheek music video-inspired advert, expressing the mother's freedom to show off the new pump.
Four real moms dance on a track in a street-scattered village of cows and sing songs: "Yes I give milk myself, but you don't see a tail" and "Yes, you probably don't see a mole, that's my breast."
The chorus goes on to say: "Pump him, pump him, I'm feeding his children, pump him, pump, I'm milking my women."
However, the announcement, posted on the firm's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed response from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the dairy industry's "terribleness."
A lot of wrong decisions have been made to use cows to advertise this product.
For the scripture says, "All this has been accomplished, that the children conceived and bore a son, and those who didn't die will be saved in the last days."
Elvi breast pump fits perfectly inside the nursing bra (Elvi/Mother)
Another commented: "This is extremely traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why shouldn't mothers keeping their babies use a breast pump ad?"
Another added: "This is an out-of-touch ad."
The second ad defends, a woman admits that she felt the song "Hilarious."
I think this is a genetic thing.
If I still needed it, I'd still need it.
From the looks of it, I feel like a pig.
This is a little crazy, but I can see what it is.
"It's a generic product," he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad intended for moms who are pumping (often in their workplaces or toilets) and who look like cows."
This is not an advertisement praising or valuing the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they were all dancing with a discreet pump placed in their bra.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the understanding that many women who pump breast say they feel like a cow.
Although Elvy Pump is fairly silent, it has no wires or tubes and sits fairly fit inside a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to roam, hold their children, and even go out while pumping.
Ana Banarin, Mother's Partner and ECD, commented: "The Elvi Pump is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and aggressive launch.
By drawing a parallel between expressing women and dairy cows, we want to bring breast pumping and all its challenges to light, and by demonstrating it with fun and determination that this new pump comes with a wonderful sense of liberation.
This isn't the first time El Paso has become a leader.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children used the product to catwalk for designer Marta Jacubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
Although the number of detained migrant children has increased, the proportion of monthly border crossings has not changed, as the harsh conditions and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to put children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are non-documented immigrants and fear for their own ability to live in the country by moving on to claim those children.
In June, federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that information would be shared with immigration officials, raising the risk with this announcement.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, confessed to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor numerous citizens.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of sponsors or members of the household illegally reside in the country, and most of them have a criminal connection.
So we continue to press the steps of those individuals," Albens said.
In order for the children to be dealt with more quickly, the authorities introduced new rules according to which some of them would need to appear in court within a month of detention, which, according to earlier shelter workers, was 60 days.
Many immigration judges will get to request their case for legal status, via a video conference call, rather than an individual.
Those who are deemed unfit for relief shall be disposed of expeditiously.
The longer children remain in custody, the more anxious or depressed they are likely to be, resulting in violent clashes or escape attempts, according to reports from shelter workers and recent months of systemic abuse.
Lawyers said there were growing concerns at a large facility like Torniello, where children are more likely to be ignored due to the number of children they have.
They added that moving to a tent city without giving enough time to prepare children emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can shock many people who are already struggling.
Syria called on the US, French and Turkish to immediately withdraw 'occupational forces'
In an address to the UN General Assembly after eight years of war, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moolem asked Syrian refugees to return.
Maullem, who also served as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops were illegally occupying Syrian soil under the guise of fighting terrorism and "justice will be meted out to them."
They must return immediately and without any conditions, he told the assembly.
Moulayem stressed that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, which has killed more than 360,000 people since 2011 and displaced millions from their homes.
"Damascus will continue to fight this war until we have cleansed all Syrian territory," he said, "for the foreign presence of both terrorist groups and any illegals."
The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 1,000 French troops are on the ground in a country that has been ravaged by war.
On the refugee problem, Moulay said conditions were good for them to return, and accused "some Western countries" of spreading "irrational fear" that forced refugees to flee.
We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
They are politicising what should be a purely human problem.
The United Nations and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid for Syria will not be provided until a political agreement to end the war between Assad and opponents is reached.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in one of the last strongholds of Idlib rebels has created an opportunity to push political negotiations forward.
The Russian-Turkish deal halted a major possible attack on a province by Russia-aligned forces in Syria, where three million people live.
Moulayem, however, stressed that the agreement had "specified deadlines" and hoped the military action would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra fighters, who would be "destroyed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moulayem created the conditions for participation in the committee of the Syrian government, which said the row's work should be limited enough to "review the clauses of the current constitution," and warned against intervention.
Why do you think Trump won a second term?
By that logic, Mr. Trump will be able to win re-election in 2020 unless, of course, the scandal and scandal ends your presidency ahead of time, which many liberal viewers are probably hoping for.
There is no doubt that "there will be a dramatic final confrontation of the presidency that never happened!"
So far, there are no signs of the viewer's fatigue.
Since 2014, the president-time rating has more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly three times to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Focus News's major-time viewers average is 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has gained prominence in cable ratings with about 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.

When I got to Mr. Fleiss this week, the sun was 80 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was more keen on watching MSNBC than recording CNN inside.
He could not remove himself, the Senate Judiciary Committee of Breitbart could not face the future of the Supreme Court and the balance hanging in the balance,
I remember when we were doing all the crazy shows of the past days and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western culture," Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but in the end they got it right.

The money from outside comes riding in the rigging of the mid-term elections.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th is seeing a flood of wealth, thanks to the rebuilding of congressional districts that pitted two incumbents into the same seat.
These recently remodeled suburbs outpace Pittsburgh District Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Keith Rothfuss of the Republic, who currently represents the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, with the new 17.
The maps were redrawn following a January decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that ruled that the old districts were run secularly in favor of Republicans.
The new 17th contest has touched the finance slugfest between the main party's financial woes, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning the widely-watched special election in March.
That seat held a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political analysts have given a little more edge to the Democrats.
The U.S. imposed a penalty on El Salvador for cooperating with China, then returned
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with Thidi retreating from Washington.
Mr Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June and had a hotel in Panama until the partners disbanded the Trump Organization's 2017 management team.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "current decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore," U.S. Department of State spokeswoman Nari Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the idea of the penalty was only against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid, including drug control, development and economic cooperation, in 2017.
The proposed penalties, which included deductions on economic aid and targeted restrictions on visas, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials pushed back a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, similar to last year's meeting, which was seen as a step toward efforts to stop the flow of migrants into the United Nations.
But by mid-September, the top management made it clear that they wanted the convention to go ahead, effectively ending any idea of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now set to address the conference, which will gather the administration in mid-October in a sign of imports, diplomats said.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new harsh messages or sentences from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to give a statement on the details of the debate, which was described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their accounts were supported by an outside analyst who was close to the management and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study history
The shoes could then be placed on special counsel Robert Mueller's report about possible obstructions to Mr. Trump's justice, which is now very convincing evidence in the public record.
Mr. Muller is also said to have turned his attention to whether Mr. Trump's campaign coincided with the attack on Russia's elections.
Should Congress change hands, Mr. Trump will see himself face to face with responsibility in that system as he prepares to go up against voters and perhaps even a panchayat of his peers in the end.
That's a lot of possibilities, and I don't mean to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - that he's not even sworn in in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect how long the conflict can last.

We failed, and we missed the opportunity to stop the genocide that will take place in the coming years.
The direction of the foundations of history around such segregation points, and the vulgar movement of democracy, is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face some of these divisive points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Law Officer Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the future of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been surrounded by problems ever since the newspaper reported that last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his impotence for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the account of The Times is inaccurate.
How will we respond if the F.B.I. investigation into the new request for deletion is not complete or equivocal - or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And on top of all that, will we vote in mediation for Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will last for a long time.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.

Greg Dornan of Ranger is optimistic ahead of the competition against Rapid Vienna
Rangers became the host of Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that following an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, the victory against the Austrians would put them in a strong position to qualify from the G class of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dornans from making his first appearance until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal in the season but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for more great things to come.
It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good side," the 31-year-old said.
We went into the game believing we could get something and came up with a point.
We could have won it in the end, but a draw was probably the right result.
They were probably good in the first half and we came in second half and were on the good side.
It's Friday night, and it's another big night.
"Hopefully, we can get three points but it will be a difficult game because they had a good result in the last game but, with the backing of the crowd, I am sure we will be able to go ahead and get a positive result.
The past year has certainly been difficult, with all the injuries I've had and the changes in the club itself being a factor that makes the space look good now.
The group is good and the boys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
Let's hope we can get through this season and get back on track."
Women are losing sleep due to the fear of retirement.
Although the survey participants had an idea of how they wanted to be cared for, some people were talking about it with their family members.
In a national-level study, nearly half of the individuals said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they spoke to their children about it.
People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to communicate," said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance business at Nationwide.
This is where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family for care if you don't know your wishes ahead of time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as those choices can be an important component in determining costs.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor may also be able to help you with a way to pay for the expenses incurred.
Your funding choices for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance plan, a cash-value combination of term life insurance plans to cover these expenses, or a self-insurance plan with your own assets as long as you have the money.
Get your hands on the book and get your hands on it quickly.
Get a health care substitute so you can hire a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes in case you're not able to tell.
Also, consider having a power of attorney for your financial matters.
You will choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parents are having a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Write them down in the form of a written plan so that you are prepared.
Not only is money in the game, but who is the doctor?" asked Marty.

Man shot multiple times by an air-gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times by an air gun while walking home from a night-stand.
The victim, Devon, at the age of 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracobe when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hands.
Officials described the shooting, which took place at around 02:30 BST, as an "unplanned act."
P.D. did not see his assailant.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to communication closure, the relief authorities could not obtain any information of Donggala region north of Palu, located near the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the earthquake struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017, is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, at the end of narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongla is a coastal region more than 300 kilometres (180 mi) west of the island of Sulawesi.
The territory, an administrative region that is below the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Dongla.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but mostly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite shore of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agencies, Palu and Dongla have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed several hundred homes in Dongla.
A tsunami hit West Dongla in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire in the form of an earthquake and is hit by regular earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia on Dec. 26 in the Asih province of North Sumatra unleashed a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people living on the shoreline of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom lived in Asih.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, behind the Sumatra coast.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 quake struck the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, giving birth to a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 strikes near the city of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: Behind Sumatra, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mantawai Islands, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed nearly 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the PD Jaya region of Asiha, which caused damage and upheaval as people remembered the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami disaster.
This time the tsunami did not come, but more than 100 people died due to collapsed buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists.
Sara Palin's eldest son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sara Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for interfering with a domestic violence report and creating barriers to arrest, according to a report released by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone from her.
Palin's Met-Su trial is being questioned at an earlier facility and is being held on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "definitely not guilty" when asked for his plea, the network noted.
Palin is facing three Class A offenses, meaning she could face up to one year in prison and a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B crime, which carries a one-day prison sentence and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sara Pali, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The matter is currently before the court of experienced Alaskans.
In January 2016, she was charged with having a weapon associated with the incident in the form of a domestic assault, a domestic violence crime report, molestation and drunken driving.
His girlfriend alleged that he punched her in the face.
Sara Palin was criticized in 2016 by a group of veterans after linking her son's partial behavior with PTSD to her service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of people have been killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake has rocked a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication network has come to a standstill and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
An earthquake has just struck off the central Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos of the incident are going viral on social media.
When the tsunami struck the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the rare death penalty for the suspect of a terrorist attack in NYC.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sepulo Saipov, the New York City terrorist attack suspect who killed eight people - the rarest punishment the state has ever given for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a home depot tenant truck to attack a bike ramp along the western side highway in low-lying Manhattan, which rammed into pedestrians and cyclists on its way to Oct.
Filled in in New York's Southern District, a notice of intent to demand the death penalty, to justify one death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily injury.
According to the court document, both of those reasons provide for the possibility of a death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a federal maha panchayat reprimanded Saipov with a 22-count charge that included eight charges of murder with dacoity, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime lawsuits, and one charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditation," describing how Saipov had behaved in a "hateful, cruel and deprived" manner, prosecutors said.
Objective notes cites, "Cyfuolo Habibullevic Saipove Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clevis, Ann Laurie DiCat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlage, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mondeza and Alejandro Damian Puncho, families and friends of injury.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been nearly a decade since the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York in 1953 was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were convicted and sentenced two years ago on charges of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during a Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were electrocuted to death on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, a native of Saipov, Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
According to the report, Saipov told officials that he was inspired to attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
Police said he had also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22-convicted charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the decision.
"We think that the demand for the death penalty, instead of accepting a plea for life in prison with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense forces had previously asked lawyers not to demand the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
During a protest at the Tory convention today, Nigel Farage took an oath to assemble the people's army.
"The former U.K. leader said the politicians had ""warm experiences"" from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU."
Peter Boone, a conservative back-and-forth leader, said in March in Birmingham that if Mr. Farage had been Brexit secretary, the UK would have "got out" by now.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faces to regain her deeply divided position has been underscored by the pro-Reiman Tories who have joined separate protests against Brexit in the city.
The president has been struggling to keep up with his plan to reconcile his checkers between Brexiteers, reminers, and EU attacks.
The Allies asserted that she would go ahead by trying to make a deal with Brussels despite the sheer negative reaction - and force Eurosceptics and labor to choose between her aid and ‘anarchy’.
Mr. Bon said that he wanted to leave the rally at Solihal, so he wanted the checkers to be removed.
You suggested that Mr. Farage should be made an ally and given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If they had been in charge, we would have been out by now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: I will support Brexit but we need to remove the checkers.
Setting up his opposition to the EU, he said: We did not fight to be subservient to world wars.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bohn rebutted the suggestion that the 2016 vote had changed people’s minds. “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to live is completely wrong.”
Andrea Jenkins, who had a Tory breakout, was also in March, telling reporters: I am simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Checkers are not popular in the general public, opponents are not going to vote for them, they are unpopular in our group and in our workers who actually work in the streets and help us get elected in the first place.
Please put the checkers down and start listening.'
In a pointed message to Smt. May, she added: Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.
Mr. Farage said rally politicians should feel the heat if they were to betray a decision they made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is a matter of trust between our people and our political class," he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're going to tell them today, 'We're not going to let you down after you've done that.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: I want you to create our political class, which is on the verge of betraying the Brexit, to experience the heat.
"We are building an army of the people of this country that won us the Brexit and will not rest until we have an independent, self-governing, sovereign United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the survivors marched across Birmingham before holding a two-hour procession in the city centre.
This weekend, after the start of the group, a group of activists waved banners against Brexit.
As soon as the convention opened, Labour colleague Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservatives with a party app for the safety problems they were facing.
"These are the people who tell us that they can keep systems in place and all the technologies for Canada Plus Plus to have a non-frills border, so that free trade can happen in Ireland without borders," he added.
"It's a full-scale effort.
"There's no such thing as a good brake seat," he said.
"Warren plans a ""strict look"" at President Trump"
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will take "a hard look at President Matteo Renzi for a duck" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, GOP State Representative Geoff Dil, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign, is running for re-election against him in November.
She's probably at the center of speculation that she'll go against Trump in 2020.
The afternoon event in Holoc was Trump's 36th meeting with constituents using his townhall format after taking office on Saturday.
A participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was now "time for the women to go to Washington to cast a spell on our broken government, and cover up the fact that it was a woman who stayed on top."
Man shot to death in LSU's Sims shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims has been arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 11 a.m. A. Dyson Simpson, 20, at the ET news conference.
He released a video on Friday asking for help in identifying a man seen in the footage.
The Seams, 20, was shot and killed near the southern university of Patangan early on Friday.
Vaide was shot in the head on the seams and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, 247 sports per day.
Wade came to the rescue of his friend and was shot by Simpson Way.
Simson was asked and he confessed to being on the scene, armed, and Wade confessed to shooting Sims.
Simson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 minor who grew up in Baton Rouge, the Sims played 32 games with 10 stars in the Vital Season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton won the world title by defeating Sebastian Vettel with the orders of the team
It became clear for the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, that the team called in would play a large part in the Mercedes race.
From Paul, Botas got off to a good start and almost hung out to dry Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his group mate.
Vettel moved to Pitts before leaving Hamilton in traffic at the tail end of the volume, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes later kicked a lap and Vettel came back, but Hamilton went ahead with some wheel to the wheel after the action that saw a Ferrari driver leaving the inside side unharmed free from the risk of being caught after a double-move for the defense at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started with the back row of the grid on his 21st birthday and came seventh at the end of the first circle.
He then relied on his tyres for the quarter, leading a large portion of the race thus moving ahead of Sadhy and Kimi Raikkonen, aiming for a quick end.
In the 44th circle he finally came to the pits, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight circles as Raikkonen took fourth.
It's a tough day because Voltaire did an excellent job over the weekend and I was told by a real gentleman.
The team did an exceptional job of having one or two," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump on Saturday ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein in a procession, urging her not to tear up the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing her of sexual harassment of the Supreme Court-appointed Brett Lee.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly comment on Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate shows that people are "selfish and bad and unpatriotic."
"One thing that could have happened and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the Senate over the last few days is when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and selfish and evil and untruthful," he said.
"When you see the lights and the leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.'
I didn't do this.'
Do you remember?
Dr. Dre, did you get it right?
Remember the answer to that... did you leak the document - "Oh, where?"
Oh, no.
I didn't lock up."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak, we connected to the influence of the senator.
In late July, Feinstein was sent a letter by Ford detailing the charges against Kavanaugh, and it leaked in early September - but Feinstein denied that the leak did not originate from his office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak them, Finstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"She told me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as I told her."
But she didn't see any disapproval to sit down with the president, who commented at a Saturday night rally: "What I'm telling you, was a very bad body language.
Maybe not, but it's the best song I've ever heard.
Advancing the defence of the Supreme Court convict, who is accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that Democrats were using the charges for their own.
They are determined to take back the necessary power anyway.
You can see selfishness, arrogance, they don't care who they're hurting, they have to run to get power and control."
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars hit back at Dandi on Friday, winning 5-3, paving the way for the Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants.
The Giants got a two-goal lead early in the attack from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bluvier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney restored the lead for the Giants before they brought home the home side level.
Francis Butcherd equalised with Dundee before Lucas Lundwold Nelson scored two goals to ensure his victory.
Adam Keyfessman lost in the third Elite League of this season to Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between these parties, in which the Giants won the last three matches.
Dwyer's opener came in at 3:35 in the fourth minute with Kendall McFall's help, with David Radarford providing assistance as Bluewillier doubled the lead after four minutes.
In the busy start period, Sullivan was brought back to the game at 13:10 before becoming the provider to equalize with Matt Marquardt Covini at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that when he scored his second goal at the end of the first night, the Giants got a boost in the first break.
The home side regrouped and Bucharest once again put him in a level-term with a powerplay goal at 27:37.
At the end of the second session of the first match, Colney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nilsson lead Dundee and set him up for his team's fifth half-way victory in the final session.
The Gators, who have now lost four of their last five games, are in their next match at the Milton Keynes home on Friday.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in air strikes to save lives
An airliner in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after it was confirmed that it had taken off a plane with thousands of people safely off the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, prompting a tsunami.
Severe aftershocks can destroy the region and many are trapped under the rubble in Palu-Nagar.
After his associates escaped, 21-year-old Anthonyus Gunwan Agung seriously refused to leave his post at the Palu Air Station in Mutiyara Sis al-Jufri airfield.
It was ensured that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway, could take off safely.
When he saw the control tower collapsing, he jumped off.
He later died in hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia said the decision could save thousands of lives, the Australian ABC News reported.
We had prepared a helicopter to take us from Balipan in Kalimantan to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning just before reaching Palu by helicopter.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, officials fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the country's disaster renewal agency reporting that the towns of Dongla, Sigi and Boutong are out of reach.
Sutopo Puro Nugraho, a spokesman for the agency, said, "While many people have not been able to be reached, it is believed that the bodies of many people are still buried under the rubble."
The high waves of up to six meters have destroyed the palu, in which a mass burial ceremony will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
In an interview with Sky News, 35-year-old Risa Kusuma said: "Every minute an ambulance brings a body.
Clean water is scarce.
Every minute of every day, the market is on the verge of collapse.
Jan Galfand, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what will be found there.
"It's a crime, but it could be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night, because the work related to the invasion can be completed."
Are you ready for the NFL Draft?"
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one person is missing after the plane crash in Laguna
That single-line operated flight crashed in Micronesia, in the Pacific Lagoon, now showing one person missing, when it was previously said that all 47 passengers and the driver had escaped safely from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that the account was unavailable for the male passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
In an attempt to land at Chuak Island airport, local boats helped rescue the passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said the six passengers were in the hospital on Saturday and their condition was stable at the time.
The cause of the accident is yet to be ascertained and the exact cause of the accident is yet to be ascertained.
Both the airlines and the US Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon short of the runway.
Some observers thought the plane would overshot the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jensen said the plane had crashed.
"It's a good thing," Jones said.
Jensen said that A and others managed to escape by crossing the water up to the waist for emergency export on the sinking plane.
The flight attendants were rummaging and shouting, and they also sustained minor injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who had made repairs on the nearby coast before the plane sank in water up to 30 meters (100 feet) were also able to help with the rescue by using inflatable boats to rescue people.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline crashes in the past two decades, but this does not include Air Niughi.
An analysis of the night time line shows that a woman is burned alive.
In a review petition, the prosecution on Saturday ruled in the case of a man who was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett specialises in the field of khufufa analysis.
She mentioned before the jury how she used her cellphone records to piece together the pieces of the activities of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Telisni and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, who died the night she was held.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cellphones, which contradicted Telis earlier claims that Telis was with her on the evening of Chamber's death.
When the data showed that his cellphone was with Chambers, he told him that he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford took the stand and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if he was in the truck with Sanford that night, whether Tellis was telling the truth, he said, "He's lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another anomaly is that Teles said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The phone records indicated that the couple had known each other for a week.
Rowlatt said that shortly after Chambers' death, Teles removed the text, call and contact information of the chamber from his phone.
He took her out of his life, he said.
A hearing is scheduled for Sunday to determine the final outcome.
The judge said he hoped to take the abuse to the jury later that day.
Thread: What's the opposite of hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge a negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The upper castes from Bristol claimed that the hip-hop movement has moved away from its roots in political messages and resolving community issues.
They want to get back to their roots and re-popularize wake hip-hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Loki.
Another black man?!
N.Y. Nani has used the term "nationalist" in the wake of the "nationalist" tech scandal.
"She was another black person," the mother complained after receiving an inappropriate remark that a New York-based nanny couple was being discriminated against and sued for dismissal from a job.
The couple denied having their own nascent, comparing the claim to "money laundering."
Nancy Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, was disappointed to find her new babysitter, Giselle Morris, black on the first day of her work in 2016.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOTHHER BLACK PERSON, Mrs. Plasco-Flexman texted her husband.
However, she sent the Virgin Morris twice instead of sending her husband.
According to the New York Post, an "inconvenient" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morrison after realizing her mistake, saying that the current nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was expecting Filipinos to replace her.
The girl was sent to Bhutan for one day's work and an Uber was sent home.
Now, Morris is filing an indictment seeking damages for the couple's dismissal, and is seeking damages of $350 per day for six months, initially hired by her for residential work, but without a contract.
I want to show you that, look, you can't do this," she told the post on Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
Responding to the claim that the couple are naturopaths, he told them that it was appropriate to terminate Morris' employment, fearing that he could not be trusted after being insulted.
My wife sent her something that she didn't intend to say.
She is not anti-Semitic.
"We're not anti-Semitism," President Trump told reporters.
But can you put your child in the hands of someone you thought was wrong, even if they were wrong?
What's your new baby?
Let it go. "
Comparing the experiment to "money recovery," Plasco said: "I was left with a month to have a child with my wife and she was in a very difficult time."
You're following someone, right?
This is not a good thing," said the investment banker.
Although the legal process is still going on, the public court has responded quickly to the couple's condemnation on social media, blaming their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington's publishers were afraid that the text would link to a talking bear, published in a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born soon after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to keep the first-time reader in place of the seed before publishing.
"We know now that this is a huge success, and we know it's going to be amazing."
Her father, who inspired her to write a children's book with a small toy bear, previously worked as a BBC cameraman, was sarcastic about abandoning her work, telling her that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was a "bittersweet," after which she died the following year.
Paddington, who he calls "an important member of his family," said his father was proud of his potential success.
"He was a very quiet person, and he wasn't a self-righteous person," she said.
But because Paddington wasn't very real to him, it was like if you had a child who achieved something: you'd be proud of it, even if it wasn't actually working for you.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although this was his own creation and imagination, he always credited it to Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing her daughter, she was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to show her life.
Ned always called to say that this was really bad, because he didn't expect it to be successful, Mrs. Eden-Leperosai said.
Then I got a call from Ned that he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "I love you, Tatiana.
You'll be with you soon.
Ill be with you.
Doctors gave her medication for her heart pumping, which was slowly losing effect and leaving her system.
She had been in a coma for a short time, and it was all gone.
All I knew was that I had to sit there and wait.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by my family and people.
I really wanted to keep it under control."
Ante Mrs. Adnan-Lepperhouse, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were suffering from a mental disorder she was suffering from, so unaware.
No one knew, she said.
My head was down and I was sweating all the time.
It's hard to understand, but it was on the flight, I felt this heavy sense of sympathy for Ned.
It was because of my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Victims post-cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones due to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries are posting an inspirational message and a card on the phone number, which people can call to ask for help.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to have to experience what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, told her that her son was a promising cook with an impressive smile.
Everyone knew him by his wits.
He always said that his memory brightened up any room."
However, before his death, he left work, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother, the suicide bomber, was looking for his brother.
Ms Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a handbook on the impact."
Mrs. Davis issued the card, "to show people that there are a lot of people they can go to and talk to," even if it's just a friend.
"Don't be shy, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphries, who has been Mrs. Davis's aunt for years, said that shortly after Mark's mother's death, she lost her 15-year-old companion Mark.
"He never said he felt sad or depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his nature.
"It was a huge disappointment on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents, they didn't see anything in front of you or in front of you."
Her death was a big shock to her, but she has to work on it: "This makes a hole in the family.
This is what separates us.
But we all have to keep fighting."

"I thought we could actually get what he wanted - a limited time of exploration, a limited scope of work - maybe we could bring some unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, noting that the committee was biased and "falling into gridlock."
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporter not like the FBI investigation?
They want to change because of their time.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as is expected, the Republican does poorly, he will be slack in his attempt to choose his desired man in the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was calling the senators, pleading for their support for Mr. Kavanaugh, who had hired Mr. Bush at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, Mr. Bush's private secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a Vogue in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which will allow Mike Pence to break the tie and become vice-president of the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea under Kim "reduced"
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byong-sage of the South's Ministry of Integration said there were 1,127 refugees last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the main reason for the strict border control between North Korea and China and the acceptance of high tariffs by traffickers was because of this.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
A large number of refugees from the North are finally being offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The highest number of flights took place via China, which has the largest border with North Korea and is easier to cross between the two Koreas in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between high defenses.
China takes refugees as illegal migrants, not accepting them as refugees, and repeatedly sends you back forcibly.
Relations between the north and the south - which are still technically at war - have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks, where the issue of denuclearization was a key topic.
This came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June when they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday blamed U.S. sanctions for undermining progress there.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr. Ri said that without any trust in the United States, our national security will not be trusted, and in such situations, there is no way that we disarm ourselves before unilaterally.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a "histeric," making him ineligible to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hesitating" and said he was unfit for the nature of the Supreme Court to rule.
Pelosi made the remarks at an acquaintance at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had ever performed in such a way, they would have called it 'historical'," Pelosi said on Thursday about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Kristin Blassey Ford while they were both in their teens.
While discussing his family and high school, Kavanaugh was very emotional in his early years, sometimes almost outspoken and strangulated.
He also condemned the Democratic Party's "inappropriate" charge of "violent and coordinated character assassination" by liberals, which led to Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court because it makes it clear that he is biased against the Democrat.
"I think she's made herself unfit, from the excuses and the style in which she went after Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi expressed doubt on whether she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if this was confirmed and if the Democrats managed to win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll do it - if they're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not fair to be in the Supreme Court, but in the courts," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is presently a Judge in the D.C. Circuit of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about the Appropriate Attention Act or Roe v. Wade v. Probable Kavanaugh because it comes down to a conservative justice human being.
During his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is not the time to go to the court of historical, partisans, and we are expected to say that this is not going to be very good," Pelosi said.
Women need to do this.
It's been months and years of frustration that she can't get out of the house.
We cry when we're angry," Ms. Steinman told me after 45 years.
I don't think this is unusual, do you?
She continued, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an employee somewhere, who told Jane that she was crying, that she even developed a technique when she got angry, which meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person in front of her, who was talking to her, 'You think I'm sad because I'm crying.'
I'm in a rage."
And she's just moving forward.
And I think that was wise."
Tears are allowed in the form of exports as part of anger, because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories from an early job in the male-dominated office, where once I found myself crying with uncontrollable rage, was whether I was caught by a woman with a sore throat - a sharp manager, which I was always a little scared of - dragging me on a ladder.
Don't ever let them see you cry, she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They will be happy to see you, and they will be happy to see you."
Patrickia Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der, who was the president of a Democratic Congress in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for his presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Harton was caught in an extramarital affair in a boat called a monkey business, and she was thrown out of the competition, Mrs. Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der was very disappointed and felt that she should not consider herself running for president, there was no reason behind it.
30 years later, she smiles and says to me, "It wasn't a well thought out decision."
"There were already seven contestants in the competition and the last thing they wanted was another one.
Some called it the "Snow White and the Savage Warfare."
Because the campaign had been delayed, she was behind in collecting the capital, and that's why she swore not to participate in the competition until she collected $2 million.
It was a defeated war.
She learned that some of the patrons, to whom the men had given $1,000, would give her only $250.
Did they think I was being discharged? She was surprised.
When she announced in her speech that she would not run a formal campaign, she went out of her way to express her gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system, which made it harder to raise money, and anger at voters targeting and gender discrimination instead of representatives.
"You might have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
You may have noticed that my computer was my personal computer.
I wonder what they're going to put on my desk.

How could the U.S.-China trade war be a good thing?
Experts believe that the initial period of the trade war between the US and China has been terrible, and until this war is over, the benefits for Beijing may increase in the long run.
US President Donald Trump earlier this year warned of tariffs on major Chinese imports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase this week came with the latest tariffs, imposing half-a-dozen tariffs on all goods entering the U.S. from China, affecting goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion).
Beijing has responded each time it has imposed tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of goods.
China has promised a short-for-short match with the United States, and the world's second-biggest economy is unlikely to bounce back.
To return to Washington means to lean against the will of the people, but to bow in public against the United States would be extremely embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing does well, the pressure of the US trade war can positively support China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact is, Washington or Beijing may have made an immediate political decision to create conditions that would trigger an economic telespin, or even more terrible than what previous viewers in the country saw," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who looks at Asia for the Center for New American Security, Think Tank.
"Syria is ""ready"" to send back the refugees, the foreign minister said"
Syria says it is ready to return refugees voluntarily, and is appealing for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said that the situation in the country is improving.
He said that today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure to move forward in the fight against terrorism.
The government is continuing rehabilitation in areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people in the country are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alim said the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that there would be no co-operation or co-operation from the countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris.
Team Europe beat Team America by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National, out of Paris, France, winning the 2018 Ryder Cup.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on the European axis and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe earned Mukut, as Denmark captain Thomas Byrne's tin reached 14.5 points, a feat he needed to defeat the United Nations.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most part of the tournament, dipped his t-shirt into the water in the 16th hole Per-3 and won his match against France's Molinari.
After the tournament's current format began in 1979, Italian golfer Molinari took a shine in all of his travels, with 1 in 4 players leading 5-0.
American Jordan Spieth, the bottom-ranked player in the European team, was blown away by Denmark's Thorborn Oleus 5&4.
World number one Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who probably played in his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the all-time European winner in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but I am alive today.
This is going to be a tough year.
Thank you for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get the ball back.
"It's about the team and I'm glad I was able to help.
He carries a torch to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles game on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud, I grew up watching that man beat Tiger Woods," the 23-year-old said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
The strange figure of one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, finished second after Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA has struggled to get Fairways through the week with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finnau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk, after a disappointing performance for his team, said, "I'm proud of these people, these people fought.
This morning we had a little bit of a warm up.
We fought.
Welcome to Thomas.
He is the best captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will all be together once again, I will be working with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward."
"I am very fond of these 12 players and I am proud to serve as captain.
You need to get the top of your hat.
We got out."
