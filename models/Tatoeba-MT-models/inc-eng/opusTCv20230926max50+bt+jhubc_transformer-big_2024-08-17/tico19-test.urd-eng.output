How long have these symptoms persisted?
And all chest pain should be treated in the same way, especially at your age.
And with the heat.
You also need to check your blood pressure.
Are you still having a fever?
Do you have a pain in your heart now?
You also have difficulty breathing.
Can you tell me what other symptoms you're having?
And how much you've grown
I have food, too.
I've got a small and light
I'm having a lot of chest pain today.
Is this the right time for you to have an allergy?
It will cause pain in the chest.
I think I have a little fever.
And I want to tell you where the heart hurts
And they have a fever.
And with your history of diabetes.
And you know it feels like my heart is breaking.
And you know people eat me all the time.
And you've got a pain in your heart
And you're saying you've got pressure on the chest
Someone at home has a heart attack with high blood pressure.
Are there any other signs or symptoms that you're experiencing?
Do other people in your family have the same symptoms as you?
Do you have any other symptoms.
Do you have difficulty breathing?
Do you still have a pain in the neck?
Because it's the season of peace.
But we can't ignore the pain that starts in the chest.
The most important thing is the pain.
I'm having difficulty breathing
I know a lot of people are going to eat me.
But we need to treat every chest pain with utmost seriousness.
You're still breathing, right?
I had completely forgotten about the pain.
Do you feel like someone is squeezing your heart?
Are you still having difficulty breathing?

Do you have high blood pressure or any other chronic illness?
Do you have a chronic medical condition such as diabetes?
Do you feel pain in the chest?
Do you have blood pressure.
Do you have difficulty breathing with it?
Do you know what the symptoms were?
Did you see the picture?
Drink a lot of water today.
I'm going to do a blood sugar test.
The symptoms are similar to mine.
How high is your fever?
How's your blood pressure?
If you have a high fever
If you have a fever of one hundred or more
If you think your symptoms and problems don't seem to improve

Yesterday I had a fever.
I had a heart attack here.
I'm having difficulty breathing.
I'll send you a picture.
I'm having a heart attack today
I'm having a bit of a headache today
In my opinion, this is a scam.
I think it's a little bit.
Is it like someone sitting on your chest?
It started with a headache and a fever at the same time.
It hurts in the middle of my chest.
It's like a pain in the neck.
It's in my heart
It's in the middle of my heart.

As in the middle of the chest.
Now you can take a paracetamol for fever.
How long have you been experiencing these symptoms.
You've got a pain in your heart
Sometimes I have a pain in my chest.
You'll only have one more pain.
Is there anyone sitting on your chest?
The same thing happens with fever and cough and pain in the muscles.
In the middle of my heart
Show me where you feel the pain.
Because you've got a fever
So do you think some of these symptoms could be about getting pregnant?
Do your children have the same symptoms?
Tell me about your pain.
The fire is lit at night.
I've had a fever for the past two days.

You said you're in pain
The overall spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom increased sharply between January 1 and March 15, 2020
The overall spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK is showing similar trends, while the global COVID-19 epidemic in all countries is accelerating at different stages depending on the country.
Based on Italy's experience, hospitals and intensive care units in several countries should increase their preparedness thanks to the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients as they require intensive care in particular.
On December 31, 2019, a large number of cases of pneumonia of unknown causes were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent is the novel coronavirus, now called the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
However, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
There is evidence to date that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
COVID-19 is the most serious disease in 14% of cases, requiring hospitalization, while those with severe illness require intensive care in 6% of cases.
The mortality rate of patients admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19 is ca 4%.
In this study, we will assess trends in the overall spread of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA (EU/EEA) country and the UK (UK) and compare them with Hubei province in China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with those in Italy during 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, the COVID-19 spread further, and the dynamic state of the global COVID-19 epidemic in the rest of the world is currently in line with that country.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al reported the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to the WHO's case definition.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA, were reported by three French nationals returning from Wuhan in Hubei province, China, on January 24, 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported since 31 December 2019 to date, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths were in Italy alone.
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> To achieve aggregate data and cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) receives data on COVID-19 cases in every country around the world only from official sources, the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
The data was used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them with Italy.
As for the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative spread of COVID-19 for 14 days, taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK during the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We presented the cumulative data of reported cases of each country from January 31 to March 15, 2020, as of 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 2020, compared with Italy during the period of March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 Trends in EU/EEA Countries and the UK
The 14-day cumulative total spread of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries in general and the UK is in accordance with Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the overall spread of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21 and then accelerated on February 28, 2020.
This was mostly due to a sharp increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but the overall spread of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK has been similarly shown to be increasing trends(supplementary content).
In Figure 2, the total number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK, in comparison with Italy during the period 31 January to 15 March 2020, is shown.
It was highlighted that, as of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., the total number of cases in the other 15 EU/EEA countries and the UK were first reported, compared to Italy, just 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends observed in the overall spread of COVID-19 show that the pandemic is growing at a comparable pace across all countries.
Despite the fact that countries are at different stages, variations in the national public health response and different definitions of possible cases in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients, including catch-up testing, must be tested to confirm COVID-19.
In early March 2020, doctors from the affected areas of Italy reported a situation in which ca 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the number of COVID-19 cases is currently available in any hospital and/or intensive care unit for 6% and 1% cases, respectively, at EU/EEA levels (data not shown).
However, recent surveillance data, including the completion of reported cases and the number of deaths, should be collected in a systematic manner.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that the availability of intensive care and mid-career beds has drastically changed from 29.2 in Germany in Europe to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that these countries will have more or less resources like Italy (there are 12.5 intensive care and mid-career beds for every 100,000 population in 2010-11).
Modelling scenarios for increasing health care capacity, estimates of COVID-19 cases hospitalized in each EU/EEA country and the UK that are associated with a <0x3E>90% concern of exceeding the capacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the ECDC's rapid risk assessment holiday update on COVID-19.
Since there are up to date clusters of cases in EU/EEA countries and specific regions in the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units in general define the population of the regional region, priority data on cases and intensive care beds facilitate the available numbering of regional units of 2 (NUTS-2).
The situation in Italy and the current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units must prepare themselves for the permanent community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and the surge of COVID-19 patients, like Italy's affected areas, requires health care, especially intensive care.
As with the recent ECDC Acute Anxiety Assessment, a fast, proactive and comprehensive approach has been described as necessary to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, which should be accompanied by a change in the prevention mitigation approach, provided that the number of cases is not expected to increase rapidly if it is not implemented ahead of time.
A list of public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic has also been listed in the rapid risk assessment.
There is a small opportunity for countries to further increase their control efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care providers.
By failing to do so, it is likely that healthcare systems in EU/EEA countries will face the need for intensive care due to an increase in patients in the coming days or weeks.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused by the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has so far infected more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 people anywhere in China and the world, with devastating consequences for humans.
Like its homologous virus SARS-CoV, which in 2003 caused SARS in thousands of people, SARS-CoV-2 can also be spread by bats and causes similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but it affects older people and women more than young people.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications about emerging disease, this article attempts to offer a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly developing research article.
We will cover the basics about epidemiology, virology, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
While many questions still need answers, we hope this review will help to understand and eliminate this dangerous disease.
The spring festival of January 25, 2020 had become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese due to the outbreak of the novel viral disease and the insistence to stay at home for all holidays and several weeks.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the spread of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease is named CoV disease (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread to nearly 50 other countries across the country and around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, there had been more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 40,000 patients recovering and 3,000 deaths as a result of the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is "the public's No. 1 enemy" and is more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, means, treatment and diagnosis since the first report of 7 January 2020 and which has determined the isolation of several patients.
This review attempts to summarize creative advances in the area of new and rapidly evolving subject matter.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with the disease caused by SARS and another CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (the MERS outbreak in 2012).
We'll talk about what we've learned so far about the diagnosis and prevention of this disease, as well as some of the key questions that remain.
CoVs have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of the common cold 4.
However, in this century, we have two of the most deadly CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the epidemic in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon the terrible disease spread to many other countries with its mortality rate.
So the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of CoV in the recorded history of humans.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the cluster of pneumonia whose sources are unknown was first reported to the China National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was released.
The first case was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, infections were reported among healthcare workers, which meant it was possible to transmit from person to person.
On January 23, all public transport in the city of Wuhan was shut down and it was locked down.
In the first clinical study of the disease on January 24, it was reported that only 21 of the 41 confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which is believed to be the site of the infection from an unknown source of animals.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time this report came in, the disease had already spread to nearly 50 countries across China and around the world (Example.2.2).
As the situation is rapidly evolving, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, on 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, one of the most up-to-date descriptions of the epidemic was listed in a multilateral study (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but especially those between the ages of 65 and 30.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over the age of 50, very few under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 has affected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread to the city and surrounding areas.
The average COVID-19 diagnosis was 5 (9-2) days from the start.
The average duration of growth was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
According to the time of mass transportation before the Spring Festival in China, the number of infected people increased sharply before June 23, 2020.
The patients with confirmed cases had a mortality rate of <0xC2><0xB1>1.44 (%95Cl:1.10-1.86%) and an adjusted mortality rate of <0xC2><0xB1>3.06 (%95Cl: 2.02-4.59%) of all patients.
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and enveloped viruses, which are part of the synthesis of receptor RNA.
They are divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha and beta -CoVs are known to affect humans.
The wrapped spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the papadyl peptide 4 (DPP4) SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion.
Viral genetics are released into the cytoplasm, then after replicating the viral genetics, the genetics make up the versions of the glycoproteins encased with RNA and the New Cleo cascadevir, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
More than 99.98 percent of the 10 samples collected from the origin of the outbreak linked to the Wuhan seafood market showed the genetic identity of SARS-CoV-2, a new type of beta, respectively.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Thanks to electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found on the very thin part of the human respiratory tract's epithelium.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor not only for SARS-CoV-2 but also for SARS-CoV.
However, the S-liquid of SARS-CoV-2 is more vulnerable to SARS-CoV than A human ACE2, which agrees with the fact that SARS-CoV causes fewer infections than SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form secreted proteins through the novel short-circuit and orf8 encoded by orf3b.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 can play a role in viral pathogenesis and express itself in IFNB, although there is no known active domain or form of orf8.
On 18 February 2020, Zhao et al., with the amino acid transporter B0AT1, reported a complex resolution in the EM structure over the full length of the human ACE2 by 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> fractions.
They found that the complexity, in which the open and closed changes were combined as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complexity could bind to two S proteins, which could ferment CoV identification and evidence of infection.
B0AT1 can be a treatment for screening drugs in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original and the Damiani representative
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both originating from bats, have been transmitted to humans through civet cats and camels.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered to be the local representative of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is similar to two SARS-like CoVs of 96 bats, such as bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is not yet known which mediators have helped to overcome barriers to infect humans, and the path of transmission has not yet been explained.
G., et al., had suggested snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans, including homologous replication within the S protein.
According to a study by researchers in Guangzhou, China, long snouted pangolins often used in traditional Chinese medicine, ant-eating mummies, pegolins, and 99% of the genes found in SARS-CoV-2 could be a potential intermediate representative of SARS-CoV-2 based on same-sex.
However, the 1% difference in prevalence between the two genomes is still a huge difference, so, too, are waiting for the final results of the comprehensive evidence (Ex.33).
Most of the physiological properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in dry environments for up to 48 hours and at temperatures below 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and up to 40%-50% humidity for up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to ultraviolet rays, and to heat up to 56<0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes, or up to 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, parasitic acid, chloroform, and other fatty disinfectants, but chlorhexidine cannot effectively inactivate the virus.
In general, the entire human population lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore prone to the novel virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4.4).
Usually, when a representative is attacked by a virus, the representative's immune system is activated by the first type of receptors (PRRs), including C-type lactant-like receptors, TLR-like receptors, NLR-like receptors, and RLR-like receptors.
Through a variety of methods, the virus causes inflammation, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of the number I type interferon (IFNs), which limits the spread of the virus and encourages its viral antagonistic genetics to accelerate microphase phagocytosis.
However, the N-liquidity of SARS-CoV can help protect the virus from an immune response.
Soon, a favorable immune response becomes involved in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including <0x2B>CD4 and <0x2B>CD8, play an important role in the defense of cells.
To produce virus-specific antibodies, T cells of <0x2B>CD4 stimulate B cells, and T cells of <0x2B>CD8 directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defense cells.
However, CoV-T can inhibit the functions of T cells by causing cell apoptosis.
Supplements of the hormonal immune system, including C3a and C5a, and antibodies, are essential to combat viral infections.
For example, MERS-CoV is neutralized by an antibody isolated from a recovered patient.
On the other hand, excess in the immune system produces many independent radicals locally that can damage the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst case, many organs stop working and even die.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is evident from the onset of clustering, and is more likely to affect older and pregnant women.
It is common in people who have a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are weak, such people are more likely to be infected than others.
Based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the growth period of SARS-CoV-2 is approximately 14-1 days, mostly 7-3 days.
However, according to a study of 1,099 cases, the average period of growth is 3 days and 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study shows that the period of growth based on 8,866 cases was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to set an effective time of quarantine based on the most appropriate period of growth to protect people from transmitting the virus from people who are infected but have no symptoms.
In general, people infected with the virus need to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Often the main and early symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, accompanied by no other symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, knee pain, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience shortness of breath and/or a stroke a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients with severe respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidity, and freezing improve immediately.
Fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even against normal pulmonary imaging, should be checked for early diagnosis of patients.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 found that of patients with symptoms of 98% fever, %76 with dry cough, %55 with shortness of breath and %3 with diarrhoea, %8 needed ventilation support.
In two recent studies, similar results have emerged about the cause of a cluster through household clustering and non-symptomatic person-to-person transmission.
In comparison, a 2012 study found that patients with MERS-CoV also had underlying symptoms of fever (%98), dry cough (%47), and shortness of breath (%55).
However, 80% of them needed ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients, and MERS is more deadly than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (%26) and sore throat(%21) were also seen in MERS patients.
It has been proven that SARS patients have symptoms of fever (100-99 per cent), dry cough (75-29 per cent), shortness of breath (42-40 per cent), diarrhoea (25-20 per cent) and sore throat (25-13 per cent), and about 20-14 per cent of the patients needed valvulation support
As of February 14, when the number of confirmed cases globally reached 66,576, the COVID-19 fatality rate was 2%.
In comparison, as of November 2002, the mortality rate in SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases was 8,096.
Based on a demographic study in June 2012, MERS had a mortality rate of 37% in 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study showed that SARS-CoV-2's R0 reproducibility was higher at 5.71-7.23 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 6.47, while SARS-CoV's R0 reproducibility was only 2 to 4.
Table 1.1 presents a comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV symptoms, mortality and reproductive numbers.
The data above suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less deadly than the latter two viruses.
Therefore, controlling the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is more difficult than the outbreaks of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Often clusters start with a single family, a single gathering, or a ship-like ride.
Most patients have traveled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas in the recent two weeks prior to the start, or have had contact with infected people or patients.
However, it has been reported that people can keep the virus inside for up to two weeks without showing any symptoms, and patients who recover from the hospital may be infected again with the virus, which rings the bell to extend the quarantine time.
In these patients, white blood cells were found to be low or equal at the initial level (especially lymphocytes).
For example, the number of white blood cells <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L in lymphophenia including the number of lymphocytes <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and the level of sprite amniotransferases and viremia were found in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had increased levels of enzymes in the liver and muscle and myoglobin in the blood, and most patients had increased C-inactive blood and atherosclerosis.
In patients with severe cases, increased blood D-dimer, fahreban deficiency, the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
The anti-normal properties in chest radiographs of COVID-19 patients are characterized by a two-way complex shadow in the lungs or fog on the ground glass.
Many patients have common pneumonia, severe lung pain, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Breathlessness syndrome, uncontrolled inflammation, a collection of fluids, and increasing fibrous gas exchange are largely compromised.
Inactivated pneumotitis of type I and type II reduces the level of head factor and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the risk of lung enlargement and their failure.
Therefore, the worst radiographic results of the chest are parallel to the extreme extent of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19, like SARS and MERS patients and the pathology of ARDS and viral infections, showed pneumocytes, the formation of the helium membrane, and the infiltration of intermediate lymphocytes, and multicellular sinus cells in the lung of the patient who died of the disease.
Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to diagnose COVID-19 was the key criteria for detecting the RNA of SARS-CoV-2.
On 13 February 2020, in China, due to the high rate of negative lies, which could accelerate the epidemic, the use of medical data for diagnosis was started (which is no longer entirely dependent on RT-PCR).
A similar situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, for an effective diagnosis, the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory testing, and radiological outcomes must all be present.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol to use CRISPR-based shrillak technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which can be used to detect RNA fragments at 100x10-18 microliters per hour (200x10-18 microliters per hour) without the need for 100 microliters/liters of artificial SARS-CoV-2.
Hopefully, if confirmed in medical samples, the new technique will dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to a lack of experience with novel CoVs, primarily physicians can provide supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while also trying different treatment options that were previously suggested or used to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (table (table2).
These methods of treatment include current and possibly antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychotherapy.
Even plasma of recovered patients was suggested to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in the race to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
In the beginning, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs, and perhaps a small amount of ACE2 is expressed on other organs such as the stomach and kidneys.
After all, respiratory failure and lung failure are the major risk factors and major cause of death for the patient.
Therefore, to help alleviate symptoms and save lives, the severity of the disease includes general oxygen, rapid flow of oxygen, non-intrusive ventilation and mechanical intervention ventilation.
Patients with severe pain in the respiratory system have to be helped by the use of a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique for treatment through the extracorporeal oxygen membrane (ECMO), at risk of life-threatening heart attack or respiratory failure.
In addition, for the care of electrolysis, the treatment and prevention of secondary infection and septic shock are essential for the protection of vital organ functions in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is said that an excess of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS results in cytokines.
Cytokinin storm is a type of systematic inflammatory response that arises from a series of cytokines including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines contain immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the major cause of severe respiratory syndrome and various organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokines, especially in severely ill patients.
Corticosteroid eggs and an anti-IL6 molecular antibody have been used to treat cytokines.
Other immune suppression treatments for cytokine strom include; IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF were blocked; JAK was inhibited; Repression of the moving cell 4; and directed modification of the T cell of the immune response, which inhibits HADC.
In SARS, steroids were widely used as an immunosuppressant as a treatment to reduce the severity of inflammation damage.
However, a heavy dose of steroids was not beneficial in lung disease in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it can cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis affecting the diagnosis in a dramatic way.
Nevertheless, short courses of the infectious dose of corticosteroids have been suggested with caution for severely ill patients with COVID-19.
So far, no effective antiviral treatment has been confirmed.
However, with the vaccine remdesivir injected into the vein in a U.S. patient with COVID-19, nucleotide analogues were found to be effective.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug, originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, the remdesivir was found to be potentially blocking other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead provided a compound of it to China for a couple of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, with results much higher than expected.
In addition, baristatinib, interferon-a, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been proposed for possible treatment for patients with symptoms of severe respiratory distress.
Treatment with lopinavir/retonavir can cause diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The combination of this treatment with other medications used in patients should be monitored carefully.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients recovering from this infectious disease to treat other patients with the disease or to protect healthy people from it.
In fact, most recovered patients have relatively high levels of antibodies against pathogens in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) that helps fight pathogens and other foreign objects through B lymphocytes and identify and neutralize unique molecules on pathogens.
On the basis of this, plasma from the blood of patients who recovered from COVID-19 was collected and admitted to 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms such as inflammation and viral load and lack of oxygen in the blood improve within 24 hours.
However, the specific method of treatment has not yet been developed, so it is necessary to confirm and explain it before suggesting its widespread use.
In addition, while looking at the effects of the treatment, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma should also be considered.
For example, antibodies enhance the immune response, and can cause cytokines-induced syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening.
In general, the number of antibodies in the blood is low, and the demand for plasma is high for the treatment of seriously ill patients.
It is difficult to develop specific antibodies so quickly to fight the pandemic.
Identifying genetic code to isolate B cells from recovered patients and encode effective antibodies is a delicate and difficult process to screen an effective antibody against the virus's essential protein.
In this way we can speed up the process of antibody production.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effects largely depend on the combination of multiple ingredients in a formula, which depends on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Many effective ingredients are unknown or obscure because such ingredients or their best combinations are difficult to extract and verify.
Currently, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or patients who have recovered from the acute phase, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19.
For example, Zhu Feng Jie Lu Capsule and Li Huang Cheng Wen Capsule have been proven to be effective in treating COVID-19.
Several provinces in China, including Gansu (63.7%), Nanjia (50%), and Hunan (50%), saw a high rate of improvement in treatment of COVID-19 patients, using traditional Chinese medicine in 87 percent of their patients, while Hubei Province, which used traditional Chinese medicine in only 30 percent of its COVID-19 patients, had a higher rate of recovery (less than 13 percent).
However, this is a fairly strict comparison, as the effects of this analysis should include many other factors such as the number and severity of patients.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and her colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine with Western medicine (WM) treatments.
They found that compared to just the Western medicine group, Western medicine <0x2B> traditional Chinese medicine group had significantly lower body temperature, symptomatic remission, and hospitalisation, compared to the required time.
Very impressively, the symptomatologically increased (light to severe) WM<0x2B>TCM group was significantly lower in the WM group only than in the WM group (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and the mortality rate (39% compared to 8.8%).
However, traditional Chinese medicine is still waiting for better and controlled trials of its performance and safety on a large scale and in more centers.
It would be interesting to highlight the method of the process of treating traditional Chinese medicine, their effective ingredients, or, if possible, their combinations.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients are more likely to be highly contagious and even fear of deadly disease, and quarantined individuals experience boredom, isolation, and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of infection such as fever, tremors, and cough, as well as the negative effects of treatment with caricature steroids, such as insomnia, can lead to more anxiety and mental stress.
In the early stages of SARS, there have been reports of a series of psychotic patients experiencing persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic excitement, psychotic symptoms, depression, and suicide.
Detecting and quarantining contact as part of public health related to the COVID-19 pandemic can make people more anxious and guilty about the impact of conflict, quarantine and stigma on their families and friends.
Similarly, COVID-19 patients, suspects, those in contact with them, as well as the general public who also need mental health care should be provided.
Psychiatric support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 and its treatment plans, and continuous and accurate updates on the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are necessary to prevent the transmission of the virus from animals and infected people to sensitive representatives, and antiviral treatment is often necessary to control the outbreak of the emerging virus.
Efforts have been made to develop S-liquid-based vaccines to produce long-term and antioxidant antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS.
A vaccine that directly affects animal models for SARS was analyzed.
However, the efficacy of these vaccine candidates in protecting elderly people, deadly challenge samples and animal virus infections cannot be determined before medical studies begin.
This is because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported so far.
In contrast, MERS clusters have continued to be found in regions other than the Middle East, where there are areas with a steady source of animal viruses.
The MERS vaccine strategy has been developed using sub-units of inactivated viruses, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viruses, and recovered proteins, and some of them have been tested on animal samples.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and important task to overcome the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome this difficulty due to the long-term (average 18 months) requirement for vaccine development and the dynamic variation of CoVs.
COVID-19 has started showing its medical course in thousands of patients as a novel disease.
In most cases, patients are able to recover without surgery.
However, COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, is associated with more disease and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, health care agencies must develop disease diagnostic models to prioritize their services in low-resource areas.
Based on the medical studies that have been reported so far, the following factors may be associated with the diagnosis or progression of patients with COVID-19 (table 33).
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is now also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurred in people aged 65-30, 47.7% of the 8,866 patients in the study described above were over the age of 50.
Patients who are more likely to have underlying co-morbidities are more likely to require intensive care, and are more likely to be older than those who do not have such complications (the average age being 66 instead of 51), which present age as a diagnostic process for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 affects men more than women(0.27/100,000 compared to 0.31/100,000).
Weakness and Complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are at risk of severe heart and respiratory attacks.
Heart attacks are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be linked to the positive cholangiocyte of ACE2, which can lead to liver damage in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying disease have a strong connection and can interfere with each other.
Unusual laboratory results: The level of C reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a potential analytic process for the treatment response and eventual recovery of the disease.
A C-reactive protein level correlation has been proposed for the severity and diagnosis of COVID-19.
Additionally, Elevated Lactate D-Hydrogens (LDH), Aspartate Amniotransferase (AST), ALA-Nine Aminotransferase (ALT), and Cretaceous can also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are expressed in a number of organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released through tissue damage.
Therefore, they are the traditional markers of heart or liver failure.
Important medical symptoms: To predict the consequences and complications of COVID-19, the temporal improvement of chest radiography and medical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other tissues.
Use of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are commonly used to suppress the immune system to reduce the severity of inflammation loss as an auxiliary treatment in infectious disease.
Because large amounts of carotenoids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, very low doses of steroids should be used in patients with COVID-19 for a short period of time.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, many patients experienced abnormal stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to long-term quarantine and witnessing the irrational deaths of close family and fellow patients.
The provision of psychological counseling and long-term support is essential for these patients to recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies done so far, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be different from that of SARS.
SARS-CoV-2, in addition to wrapping up in the lower respiratory tract, can also wrap up in the upper respiratory tract, and cause mild or no symptoms like the common cold caused by other CoVs in the early stages of infection.
Therefore, infected patients in the early stages or during the growth period can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission occurs when the patient is seriously ill, while there is not much transmission in the early stages.
Thus, the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more severe than the SARS epidemic and is quite difficult to control.
Currently in China, hopes and efforts are underway to isolate Wuhan and surrounding cities and disrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by keeping the entire population in continuous quarantine.
While these measures are dramatically hurting the country's economy and other sectors, they are reducing the number of new patients, a sign of a slowdown in the pandemic.
Fortunately, the pandemic will end in March, and the don't-swing phase will take place in three to four months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., has estimated that COVID-19, which seems to be a much more infectious disease than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longi et al., setting a model for predicting the consequences of the global pandemic, suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group said both mid-turbine and sore throats of patients who had recovered from the hospital two weeks ago were found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a circulating strain of influenza.
However, based on the decrease in the number of new cases, there are promising indicators in China, indicating that the current strategy is working.
In fact, one million cases were predicted with half a million deaths in Ebola.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been brought under control.
It is also possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is weak in spreading the infected disease and will eventually disappear or remain present with humans like the less diseased virus.
The following format provides a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS (55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through coughing or sneezing and possibly through direct contact with a virus-contaminated substance.
The virus is also found in the stomach, which creates a new possibility of passing from the mouth to the stomach.
A recent study on 138 cases found that 41 percent of the cases were likely caused by non-nervous infections, 17 patients with pre-existing conditions and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, people, especially health care providers, social workers, household members, colleagues, and even those in contact with patients or those infected, should be very careful.
The first line of defense to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of a mask on the face; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series <0x23>1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent liquid droplets from potentially infected individuals from traveling through the air or sticking to surfaces of objects from which they can reach others.
However, only N95 (serial <0x23>1860) masks can prevent the inhalation of small viral particles ranging from 10 to 80 nm, only 5% of viruses can fully inhale, SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, both about 85 nm.
Even if five surgical masks are combined, the particles can penetrate them, so health care providers who have direct contact with patients should wear N95 (serial <0x23>1860s) masks and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers must wear isolation gowns to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also spread through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus probably entered his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should wear a transparent shield or goggles on the face when working with patients.
It is highly recommended for the public in the affected or possibly affected areas to wash their hands more often than usual with disinfectant soap, try to self-quarantine indoors and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of three feet from the patient is considered appropriate.
These functions are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus in the human world, it is believed to be the highest sex of SARS-CoV as reported on January 7, 2020, and should have caused a high alert for China based on a deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan comforted citizens by saying that the novel virus has low human-to-human infectious and limited reproductive capacity and that prevention and control of the disease is not a problem.
The message brought great comfort to the alarm of the public, especially as they were preparing for the festival of Bihar, and at least in Wuhan, the time to control the disease was lost.
Disease control agencies in China may have made significant improvements in the future by learning from this difficult lesson.
For example, these agencies should (1) be careful when making public announcements as each word is important to citizens and can change the way they perceive and react to the public; (2) be sensitive to and react to the general information of the clinic rather than reacting to the official reports of doctors or officials; (3) be sensitive to and responsive to the pandemic and the system; (4) restrain the spread of the pandemic, rather than comforting the public, and controlling it in its early stages.
The COVID-19 epidemic began in December 2019 with the novel virus SARS-CoV-2.
In less than two months, it has spread to nearly 50 other countries across China and globally.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the spread of COVID-19 has created a sense of a resurgence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for keeping the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people and men more than women and has a higher severity and mortality rate in older people than young people.
SARS mortality rates are higher compared to COVID-19 (%10.91 compared to %1.44).
COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients do so when they are seriously ill, making it more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 is relatively faster and more widespread than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, regular RNA for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative.
Otherwise, the virus can be positive again in recovered patients.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
In view of the rapid progress in research on COVID-19, a number of important issues remain to be resolved, such as the following:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96 percent of genetic homogeneity has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
The original representative, from bats, who was the medium species of virus transmission in humans?
Without knowing the answer to <0x23>1 and 2, we cannot effectively reduce the transfer process and it can re-emerge at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical testing show that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to this ACE2, how does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and result in pathological changes?
The virus also binds to cells that express ACE2 in other organs.
Without the right answers to these questions, we cannot get a fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic continue?
How does the virus develop genetically when transmitted to humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, end up like SARS, or will it continue to happen from time to time?
This is important, but it may take some time to find the answers to the above and some other questions.
However, no matter how much we spend, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
The source of human coronaviruses
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven the intergenerational evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their host organisms, including humans.
Before 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illnesses such as the common cold.
The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory System (MERS) shed light on how devastating and life-threatening HCoV infection can be.
The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 once again highlighted CoVs and its rapid transmission and reduction in pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV took us by surprise.
HCoV infection is an infection transmitted from animals to humans and it serves us to understand the animal source of HCoV.
Most HCoVs originate from bats where they are nonpathogenic.
Some HCoVs are also known to host organisms between reservoirs.
Identify host animals that have a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Investigation of CoV-hosted organisms in animals provides important information about pathogenesis CoV in humans.
In this review, we present a review on the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, in which we focus on their animal origin and hybrid transmission, along with their history of discovery.
Importantly, we compare and differentiate different HCoVs from the perspective of the evolution of different viruses and the restoration of their genetics.
In this context, the current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic will be discussed.
In addition, the requirements for changes in successful host organisms and the implications of virus protection on the severity of the disease have been highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family of coronaviruses, which includes a group of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which used large genetics such as 26 to 32 kilobases between RNA viruses, were called "CoVs" because of the appearance of crown-like morphology from an electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have identical, undifferentiated genetics as participants in the same organization.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open frames of reading mounted on one another(ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the diagram of the polygons of pp1a and pp1ab.
This polyimide is applied to a further 16 non-inorganic proteins, designated nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genetics includes ORFs for structural proteins, including nostrils(S), envelopes(E), membranes (M) and nucleoli (N).
A large number of supporting algorithms for specific sequences are also encoded through CoVs of different sequences.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four generations (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), in which the beta-CoV generation is mostly composed of HCoVs and further divided into sequences (A, B, C and D).
Evidence from filo genetics showed that most bats and mice are the source of the genetics of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while the largest reserves of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV are birds.
For thousands of years, CoVs have constantly crossed different species barriers, and some of them emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 cause mild cold and/or diarrhea-like symptoms.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, which can lead to infection of the lower respiratory tract with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations being more likely in relatively and more patients.
In the mid-1960s, HCoV-229E strains, B814, isolated nasal discharges from patients with a mild cold.
Since then, more and more information has been collected through extensive studies conducted on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, before the outbreak of SARS, the idea was widely accepted that infection with HCoVs is generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is the most devastating in history, with the infectious disease affecting more than 8,000 people with a mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, an outbreak of respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the Middle East led to a persistent outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula that spread throughout the world.
2019 Novel (HCoV 2019-nCoV, later named SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world must prepare for the upcoming global epidemic of SARS-CoV-2.
The source of all seven HCoVs are bats, mice, or domestic animals.
Numerous lines of evidence support the emergence of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well-adapted and non-pathogenic but exhibit high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented numerous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
The source animal tracking of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, the power of the spread and the restriction of transmission among different species.
This could also help or guide the search for SARS-CoV-2 reserves, intermediates, and hosts of domesticated animals, with significant implications in preventing future recurrences.
In this review, we will present an overview of the pathogens of source animals, mixed-use transmission and HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the shared idea that parental viruses of HCoVs are usually non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts and become pathogenic after being transferred to their new host.
We also take a look at the evolution of HCoVs, often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenic mutations.
In this context, the consequences of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 have also been discussed.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
HCoV-229E strains were isolated from the nasal discharges of B814 previously isolated, patients with mild cold, different animals infected with different CoVs, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoVs (Figure 1), depending on the historical sequence, will be informative and instructive.
In 1966, HCoV-229E pressure was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections, and later adopted to increase WI-38 lung cell lines.
In 10 to 20 percent of HCoV-229E cases, symptoms of a minor cold, including headache, sneezing, restlessness, and sore throat with fever and cough, have been observed.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and then inserted into the cerebral pathways of small rats.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those of people who have HCoV-229E, which is not symbolically different from pathogens of other respiratory tract like influenza A viruses and pathogens.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both distributed globally, and they are more widespread in temperate climates during winter.
Usually, the growth time of these two viruses is less than a week, after which the disease lasts for about 2 weeks.
According to a voluntary study of humans, healthy people are affected by HCoV-229E, causing a slight cold.
Only a few immune-compromised patients show severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "a common pneumonia," was first well-documented in human history as a global epidemic caused by HCoV and SARS-CoV is the atomic agent, the third discovered HCoV.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in China's Zhuang Dong province.
The SARS epidemic that spread to many countries and continents resulted in 774 deaths with 8,096 cases.
In addition to the rapid spread, it was estimated that each case, in which the growth period is 4 to 7 days and the 10th day of the disease is at the limit of viral load, could increase by about two secondary cases.
SARS-CoV-infected patients initially have symptoms of muscle pain, headache, fever, restlessness, and chills, followed by zika al-nuff, cough, and shortness of breath.
Lymphopania, rare laboratory tests of SARS have a randomized function of the liver and some elevated creatinine kinases.
In SARS patients, dissociative damage of alveolar, the proliferation of epithelial cells, and the increase of macrophages are also observed.
About 20 to 30 percent of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In these severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney, can be affected, usually with cytokines strom, which can be fatal, especially in patients with low immunity.
For the first time, the virus was isolated from the open lung biopsy of an index patient's relative, who had traveled to Hong Kong from Zhangzhou.
Since then, there has been a great deal of research on HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands during late 2004.
Initially, it is found in young children, the elderly, and patients with low immunity with respiratory disease.
The disease caused by HCoV-BL63 is common in nasal mucosa inflammation, osteoarthritis, fever and meningitis.
Another independent study described separating the same virus from the nose sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although he was born in the Netherlands, he was actually born in the Netherlands.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 is about 4.7% in the common respiratory disease, and its symptoms are severe in the onset of summer, spring and autumn.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive coughing, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized due to pneumonia and inflammation of the urethra.
HCoV-HKU1 associated with severe asthma was reported, along with community-acquired pneumonia and inflammation in the urethra.
Similarly, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, with mild respiratory illness, were found worldwide.
These four community-acquired HCoVs are very well compatible with humans and are generally less likely to cause extreme pathogenic disease mutations, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons, such as the more severe subtype of HCoV-NL63, the more severe case of acute infection in the lower respiratory tract, which was reported to be the cause of severe infection.
Usually, when they are able to transmit HCoVs and sustain themselves within humans, they become low-intensity harmful or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient in Saudi Arabia who was suffering from severe pneumonia and kidney failure.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases occur in the Middle East, and occasionally in close contacts with secondary outbreaks, import cases occur in European countries and Tunisia.
In 2015, a secondary outbreak was reported in South Korea with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS, which has the characteristics of advanced acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, a number of MERS patients develop severe kidney failure, which is very different from MERS in diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases accounted for 34.4% of deaths, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses found in humans.
Between mid-December 2019 and the end of December 2019, a large number of pneumonia patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were last detected from Wuhan, China's Hubei province.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the ongoing outbreak of respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency, and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with 3.4% of those treated have died.
In particular, in Hubei, China, the mortality rate in these cases is 4.2%, while it is 1.2% outside of that.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causes severe respiratory infections and is presented as fever, cough and diarrhoea.
It has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and it can increase the syndrome of acute respiratory distress.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are closely related due to the constant similarity in the 82% high nucleotide, it is a cluster of different branches of the pathogenic tree.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus appears to be less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 reported symptoms of infected non-symptomatic subjects that could contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
There are many interesting similarities and differences in comparison and contrast with the other six HCoVs of SARS-CoV-2.
First of all, there is a lot of similarity in the duration and duration of the growth of HCoVs disease.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four other community-acquired strains (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, it has been commonly seen that HCoVs derived from the SARS-CoV-2 community show the characteristics of their infection during infection, including being unspecified, mild, or with no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as SARS-CoV infection, although this proportion is slightly lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 reveals interesting features like community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the minimal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as the community gained from HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be confirmed that, like cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after entering the human body.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2, like other HCoVs, can be found in fetal samples.
Although there are at least some circumstances that have yet to be explained in future studies as to whether SARS-CoV-2, like the case of SARS-CoV, plays an important role in oral fungal transmission.
It will also be of particular interest to see if, like community-acquired HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 will appear seasonal.
After entering humans, however, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogenesis, and sustained spread, will affect the final outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
All four HCoVs obtained from the community cause mild symptoms by adapting well to humans.
From another point of view, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both types of ancient HCoVs can survive the global epidemic.
HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans that cause severe HCoV diseases have been eradicated.
In order for this to happen, HCoVs that collect mutations will have to be replicated in humans to adequately combat host restriction.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts and the more people it infects, the more likely humans are to fully adopt it.
If it is adopted well, it will be difficult to prevent its transmission to humans through quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, four CoVs from the community have been circulating in the population, causing a common cold in immune-controlled individuals.
These viruses do not require animal stockings.
In contrast, humans did not adapt well to the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and their transmission to humans cannot be sustained.
They need to grow and thrive in their animal reserves, and possibly find an opportunity to spread through one or more medium and expansive host animals to sensitive human targets.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoVs derived from the community.
At least at this time, it is more capable of transmitting like community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether humans will adopt it completely and whether it will circulate in humans without a reservoir or intermediate host animal.
Before we talk about the origin of HCoVs, it would be better to talk about the evolution, nature, reserves, medium and extensive determination of the host animals and their characteristics.
An animal, if it has a closely related ethnic association, acts as an evolutionary host of HCoVs, sharing a high degree of similarity to the sequence level of nucleotides.
The virus is usually well adapted to this host and is non-pathogenic.
In the same way, the host organism harbors HCoVs continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, host organisms are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parent virus.
On the other hand, if HCoVs are introduced to intermediate host organisms at or before the introduction of humans, they do not adapt well to the new host and are often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as the animal's source of human infection and then play the role of a rapidly increasing host of human infections in humans.
If HCoVs are not able to maintain transmission within the host, they will go into a closed path of infection.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate host organisms and even establish long-term nutrition.
In such a case, the intermediate host organism becomes the host organism of the natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data has revealed with disappointment that the SARS index cases have a history of contact with sports animals.
A later non-proliferation investigation found that animal traders had a higher incidence of adverse SARS-CoV lgG compared to the general population.
The first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-like viruses in the live animal market were the masked palm civet cats (Pygooma larvata) and a raccoon dog.
This indirectly supports the fact that no SARS was reported after killing all of the civet bulls in the markets.
However, it has been reported that the Mask Palm Civet cats from the forest or fields were largely negative for SARS-CoV without their appearance in the live animal market, suggesting that the Mask Palm Civet cats may only be acting as an expanding intermediate host animal but are not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
In particular, since Zhang Zhou's mandis contain antibodies to SARS-CoV in 80% of different animals, a number of small mammals that are breastfed cannot be ruled out as acting as the expanding medium host animal of SARS-CoV.
All of these appear to be the closed path hosts of SARS.
The natural host of SARS-CoV has resulted in the closely related bat CoV, known as SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-Bat CoV HKU3), which is present in the Chinese horse-tailed bat.
These bats are positive for the anti-SARS-CoV antibody and the genetic sequence of SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat CoVs share a 92-88% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new idea that bats are hosts of human pathogens.
A number of SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none can be isolated as live viruses except a designated WIV1.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the receiver of SARS-CoV.
WIV1, derived from a sample of bats' feces, was demonstrated to be used as a receptor for bats, civet cats, and human ACE2 entry cell.
Interestingly, Sierra's recovered SARS patients were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the closest representative of bat-borne SARS-CoV, sharing 95 percent nucleotide sequence similarity.
However, despite the extreme similarity between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct SARS-CoV parent virus and bats are not the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
The cluster of MERS-CoV of the same group was analyzed as beta CoV-HKU4 and beta CoV-HKU5, a fellow geneticist.
Beta CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV, use the same representative receptor, dipole peptidease 4 (DPP4), for the insertion of the virus.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS, identified from Europe and Africa, is close to counterparts in Beta-CoV.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closely related beta CoV-HKU25 share only 87% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Thus, bats cannot be the host of the immediate reservoir of MERS-CoV.
Studies in the Middle East, on the other hand, showed that in a number of African countries, such as the Middle East camels, MERS-CoV has a coagulated camel seropositive for specific inhibitory antibodies.
MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was isolated from a coagulated camel's nose through a swab, and this further indicates that the camels act as a real host animal reservoir of MERS-CoV.
It should be noted that, experimentally, MERS-CoV-infected camels had generally mild symptoms but large-scale virus outbreaks were observed.
In particular, infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory tract, but also through the febrile oral route, which is the main route for the virus to flow from bats.
However, questions remain as there is no history of a number of MERS-confirmed cases linked to camels prior to the onset of symptoms, including human-to-human transmission or unknown animal species that harbor MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is a 96.2% nucleotide matching partner with the isolated CoV RAT13 bat.
Similar to the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the parental relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is very good to assign.
I mean, bats can't be a direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2 unless there are nearly identical bats CoVs in the future.
Presumably, Hunan's seafood wholesale market, which has many early cases of COVID-19 associated and possibly hints at animal-to-human transmission, will be the host animal between the SARS-CoV-2 species sold and killed.
Several recent studies based on meta-genetic sequences have suggested that a group of at-risk small mammals known as pangolins (Manus javinica), may also be a haven for native beta CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These novel pangolin CoV genetics share 85-92 nucleotide sequences with SARS-CoV-2.
However, these nucleotide sequences are as closely related to RATG13 with about 90% identification at the level of nucleotide sequence.
This file is a cluster of subspecies similar to SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the genetic tree, one of which shares a 97%.4 amino acid with a continuous identity, as well as the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2.
In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, despite the high degree of consistent matching genetics, are more diverse.
Previous studies on sick pygolons had reported the presence of viral anomalies in lung samples, similar to the associated SARS-CoV-2.
This study found partial genetic sequences, which are about 86.3% of full-length viral genomes, have adopted different assembly methods and manual safety.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence of direct support for SARS-CoV-2 from a pangolin source due to the continuity difference between beta CoVs of SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is also smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta CoVs.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is yet to be established.
While the best sequence matching has been found in the receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2-related beta CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the best widest genetic sequence matching.
It is highly speculated that, in the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 and Pegolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, selective mediation is driven by careful evolution between high levels of similarity.
In the third wild animal variant, a counter-proposal has been proposed in favour of recombination between beta CoVs and RaTG13 related to pangolin SARA-CoV-2.
The spread of recombination on a scale between beta CoVs, exists as a driving force in evolution.
A decision on a direct animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be made.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied to be animal sources.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have been the original source of bat CoVs, while parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mice.
It has been reported that a bat CoV in the North American triangulation bat, terming ARCoV.2 (Applause Ridge Cove), has shown a close association with HCoV-NL63.
HCoV-229E, on the other hand, was genetically related to another bat CoV, the term heposideros/Ghanakhawham/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, and the camels are also suspected to be its intermediate host animal.
For explanation, the current knowledge about the animal source of the identified HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Figure 2.
Fileo genetic analysis has provided evidence of cases of mixed transmission of HCoVs in history.
When the domestic live stock HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans around 1890, a global epidemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E's transmission is less clear.
Beta-alpha-CoVs have been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
There is an alpha CoV.
There is evidence to support the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, in a shared ecological niche, bats may be in contact with humans, not with alpacas.
Instead, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-associated beta alpha CoVs are heterogeneous and non-pathogenic in beta, while alpha alpha CoVs are caused by the spread of respiratory disease in infected animals.
In the end, the alpaca alpha CoV was not found in pets.
In this way, the possibility of alpacas acquiring HCoV-229E-related alpha CoVs from humans cannot be excluded.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where beta-alpha CoVs act as a genetic pool of an HCoV-229E, alpacas and camels can act as mediators, just like cases of MERS-CoV, which transmit the virus to humans.
MERS-CoV serves as the best example of a mixed transmission from bats to camels and camels to humans.
The evolutionary source of MERS-CoV in bats is known as its early identification and is also reinforced by subsequent results.
Obviously, bats provide a rich pool of virus types for the transfer of genetic fragments and interbreeding and interbreeding.
Long lifespans, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and strong flying ability are favorable conditions for bats to become an ideal 'virus spreader'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced into a Kohan camel for decades.
It is well adapted to the camels that have been converted directly from the host organism to the host organism of stable and natural reserves.
MERS-CoV maintains a very mild disease and a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its occasional transmission to humans is an accident and humans are the closed path host of MERS-CoV because they cannot sustain its transmission.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the role of pangolins, if any, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a closed-door host for SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoV, which is similar to civet cats in the SARS-CoV case.
Future studies may include or rule out the possibility of a combination of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from animals to humans.
First, bats can be a source of host organisms similar to SARS-CoV-2, a nearly identical virus.
Humans share an ecological niche with bats through butchering or coal mining.
Second, pangolins may be one of the faster intermediate host organisms, with SARS-CoV-2-related viruses newly introduced.
People get infected with the virus by eating and drinking.
It is possible that a number of nursing animals, including domestic animals, are infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies are guaranteed in domestic and wild animal surveys.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 can occur in the third species that interact with both bats and pangolins.
The animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is still under investigation.
In addition to a wide variety of host animals, CoVs are important in facilitating three major processes by the viral in crossing several types of barriers.
First, they have relatively high variation rates in RNA copy.
Compared to the other single stranded RNA viruses, the determined conversion rate of CoVs can be considered "high" by "moderate" while the average conversion rate of CoVs per year on site 2, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation of novel host organisms, is 10-4 as an alternative.
CoVs have proof-reading external bundles, whose deletion results in better mutability, attention-grabbing, and even inefficiencies.
Interestingly, the Neo-Cliotyed Analog Remdesivir is known to suppress the copy of CoVs by inhibiting this extracellular bony and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is a highly-intelligent agent tested as an anti-SARA-CoV-2 in medical practice.
However, the mutation rate of CoVs is one million times higher than that of its host.
In addition, there are often times when CoVs cannot adapt well to the host organism, with a higher rate of mutation.
Compared to the highest mutation rate of SARS-CoV, the mutation rate in well-adapted SARS-CoV-2 appears to be low in humans.
Probably, it has already adapted to another host organism close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV is applied to a well-adapted camel.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that the increased genetics will make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective immediately.
Second, the genetics in CoVs demonstrate the use of additional morphology in genetic modification for mutations and recombination in large RNA, thus increasing the probability of mutual evolution of mixed DNA, which is beneficial for the appearance of novel CoVs when conditions are favorable.
This is supported by encoded multiple unique reading frames and library functions towards the 3' end of the genome.
Third, through the unique mechanism of "copy selection", CoVs often randomly switch into RNA molds.
During the copying of CoV RNA, the host organism acting as a mixture, the door undergoes frequent changes.
To produce new CoVs, the full length of highly homologous and sub-genus RNAs can be recombinant.
Evidence of the natural combination of phylogenetics has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as BAT SL-CoV and BAT CoV-HKU9.
The transmission of the virus to the host
In addition to the three factors of virality mentioned above, viral interaction with the host organism receiver is a key factor in effective and mixed-transaction transmission.
With this, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a common example, which had shown positive selection during the mixed-cell transition.
In addition to the comparative analysis of isolates of SARS-CoVs from humans and CoVs, SARS-CoV has the idea of rapidly adapting to different host organisms, especially with the variation of the S-lithium's receptor binding domain.
In general, the receptor binding domains in the CoV's S proteins interact with the cellular receptor and are intensely selected through the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the receptor binding domain on the S1 fragment is the 318th to 510th amino acid, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its correceptors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV receptors are able to identify the ACE2 receptor for the binding domain that various animals, including bats, civet cats, rats, and raccoon dogs, allow for a mixed pancreatic transfer of the virus.
In fact, the remains of only 6 amino acids in the receptor binding domain were found to be different in the isolated viral of humans and civet cats, 4 of them in the form of receptor binding to interact with the receptor of ACE2.
The receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations, which can increase the interaction of the nostrils with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acids may prove to be an important sub-alternative for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein indicates that the essential association of its S protein with human ACE2 may change.
Indeed, a tabular electromagnetic microscope study is pointing to the linkage between human ACE 2 and SARS-CoV's S protein being -10 to 20 times greater.
It will also be interesting to determine if any other sub-receptors will be needed to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also linked to ACE2 but with a different part of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as amino peptide N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetyl-acetyl-salic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can account for the successful adaptation of these CoVs to humans after they have been transferred from their host animal to a mixed strain.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of HCoV mixed-infection transmission is monitored, relying on another host and through binding factors.
The spread of these host proteins between humans and host animals with natural reserves of HCoVs, such as bats, a Kohan camel, and rats, can interfere with mixed transmission.
For a successful mixed-use transmission of HCoVs, the angry host animal's dependency factors and disturbances are bound to the host animal.
In this regard, the molecular definition and characteristics of this important part of the interaction with the host organism of the virus are yet to be determined.
Unnecessarily extensive genetic testing of host animal dependencies and binding factors to SARS-CoV-2 may be beneficial with the use of the latest technology of CRISPR.
Emissions of Novel HCoVs: Back to the Ground
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the excretion of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, beta CoVs act as a reservoir of the genetics of an HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also enhance the evolution of HCoVs and act as two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a novel molecular coding gene has the potential to rapidly change the phenotype of a viral virus.
In SARS-CoV-assisted proteins, ORF8 is considered important in human adaptation, as were SARS-CoV-related bat viruses isolated but found different ORF8 proteins encoded differently.
The strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic have been identified to have the characteristic of 29 nucleotides ending with SARS-CoV.
This deletion divides the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is adaptive variation that promotes migration to host organisms.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of recombinant recombination with alpha- and gamma-CoV sequences, where a large number of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase recombinant small areas were identified.
The locations of the reticulocytes were identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has been observed that the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in a Kohan camel in Saudi Arabia, has had to experience recombination events between different sequences.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other CoVs, with HCoVs recombining with other animal CoVs with their non-steroidal genetics.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unannounced changes in viral genetics, possibly as a result of immunity to the virus, such as the host's immune system.
An example of its effects is the loss of the entire length of ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, which causes two nucleotides to be deleted.
Although the presence of ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca shows a single nucleotide entry of alpha-CoV, resulting in a frame shift.
Last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure in the host organisms of their reservoirs.
When bats are infected with CoVs, there is a trace of no-symptoms or mild symptoms, which indicates a mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It turns out that bats have good compatibility with CoVs both in anatomy and physically.
For example, anti-inflammatory agents in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs in activating the immune response.
In addition, the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 that inhibits the activity of the natural killer cell in bats is suppressed due to the low level of expression of the molecules of the large histocompatibility complex Class I.
Furthermore, reactivate high levels of the type of oxygen produced by the high metabolite activity of bats (ROS) by suppressing the copy of both CoVs, and by impacting the proof reading through the extremities to create highly pathogenic virus strains, when a new host animal is introduced.
Further pathogenic CoV strains can develop through recombination, which can lead to increased adaptation of the host animal to the properties of novel proteins or enzymes.
So, it's not a coincidence that three novel HCoVs emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs cause non-pathogenic or mild symptoms in their reservoir host animals such as bats and camels.
They replicate strongly without the immune response of the powerful host organism.
In it, the secrets of why symptomatic patients are shown without symptoms and the cause of severe cases in human infections are hidden.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivity of the immune response and the cytokines strom in which, from the powerful immune response, more intense lung damage occurs.
In contrast, in an asymptomatic carrier, the immune response is de-coupled from a copy of the CoV.
The same strategy of non-integrating immune responses has a beneficial effect in the treatment of contrasting SARA-CoV-2.
The interferon reaction is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, the organization of type I interferon should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the inflammatory function of NLRP3 in bats is impaired.
For this reason, the prevention of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emission of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea emerging through SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Where a bat beta-CoV has been found to share a 95% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, there is a bat-CoV sharing a 95% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals in the market have been found to harbor viruses such as SARS-CoV, the direct intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs have been found to be surprisingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, meaning that pangolins are acting as one of the intermediate host organisms or that Pangolin beta-CoVs can contribute to the final version of SARS-CoV-2 through genetic fragments.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by humans.
CoVs have come to light again due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
Studies of CoVs in bats and other animals have radically changed our views on animal sources and animal reserves of HCoVs in human transmission.
Extensive evidence suggests that the source of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is bats and has been transmitted to humans through an intermediate host animal.
Given that SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and civets in markets, SARS outbreaks can be effectively eliminated by closing meat markets and killing civets.
For the same reason, in view of the discovery of numerous sequences of pangolin beta-CoVs closely associated with SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from meat markets to prevent transmission from animals.
However, future investigations have yet to clarify when and where SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in a Kohen camel for a long time.
For the locals, these camels serve as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool as well as an important source of transport.
They are widely found in the Middle East and Africa.
So, just as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were done in Chinese markets to prevent the spread of the virus, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS.
To prevent the recent spread of MERS, a coherent approach must be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS for camels, along with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, they can lead to the emergence of new genetic variants.
In the forest, species and species of animal CoVs are circulating.
In particular, bat CoVs are very diverse with their ability in animals.
As a result of emissions of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or deadly to humans in the future, there are many opportunities for animal CoVs to evolve and reappear.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, wild animals in some places in China should give up the culture of eating.
With the trials of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be in place.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reserves until they have a chance to grow.
Although bats have many characteristics that lead to the spread of viruses, if people are educated, chances of interacting with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced.
A better understanding of CoV and its natural hosts requires continuous monitoring of the milking animals, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the epidemic from animals to humans and its future spread.
As a result, human-to-human transmission of pathogens can be more effectively prevented by staying away from the ecological niche of natural reservoirs of viruses that transmit disease from animals to humans.
Several pieces of the puzzle of being the source animal of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if a bat transmits an ethnic virus of SARS-CoV-2 to a pangolin, it will be interesting to see under what conditions bats and pangolins can share the same environmental power.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission in humans, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third-feeding animal acts as a true intermediate representative, it must explain how it interacts with other species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, because many other breastfed animals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and testing for infection should be conducted.
If there are bats, pangolins or other mammals, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 and its parent viruses, which are almost identical, will be identified among its natural representatives.
The ongoing investigation in this area will explain the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, as well as having a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnostic criteria for the "suspected case" and "verified case" of COVID-19 must be renewed
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid advisory guide for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, providing our experience and a good reference for fighting the global pandemic that has spread around the world.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, which is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research in our awareness and knowledge and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guideline, which has been issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, saying that the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected case" and "verified case" in accordance with the final guideline for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version) are provided.
In December 2019, there was a 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, now officially named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named as severe respiratory distress coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
To fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a rapid advisory guide and it has been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has gained a lot of attention since its release.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, based on the results of ongoing research in our awareness and knowledge and the experience of medical practice, it is gradually increasing; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China issued the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), a total of seven issues of which were released from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, with some fundamental changes in the context.
Now our guide has received a comment from Zhao et al., suggesting easy scoring based on their medical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guide and is a valuable reference to this global pandemic worldwide.
We give thanks for them, and we give thanks for them.
However, their work also needs to be updated in line with the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (the seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the Seventh Issue (3 March 2020), a comprehensive analysis of the history of the epidemic is required to confirm the suspected case by combining one of the features of the history of the epidemic with two items of medical description, or by combining three items of medical description without a clear history of the epidemic:
Epidemiological history: (1) the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where a respiratory history of symptoms has been reported in the last 14 days, such as a respiratory history of COVID-19; (2) the history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases in the first 14 days; (3) the city of Wuhan and the surrounding area; or
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with visual characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) white blood cell counts in the early onset stage show normal, decreased, or low lymphocyte counts.
Patho-genetics or serological evidence should include a diagnosis of a confirmed case of a suspected case of acute retinopathy with one of the following items: (1) positive of real-time PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 to be negative; (2) a continuation of the entire viral genome showing a high incidence of known novel coronaviruses or l-SAV to be positive; (3) serum testing for SARS-CoV-2 to be positive.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was included in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) counts.
Detection of pathogens in blood samples was included in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) counts; and serological evidence was included in the seventh issue.
Modifications based on spectroscopy are under way to rapidly diagnose confirmed criteria, to look for more nucleic acid detection kits, as well as to take respiratory tract, including blood samples, which increase the availability of various samples, and contribute to the positive results of specific antibodies.
In addition, there are many other evidences that remind us of caution from patients with traditional symptomatic and asymptomatic symptoms.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al should be updated, as they have classified a person without medical symptoms as "low risk."
The score system also needs to be confirmed in further medical practice and studies.
As a result, we call for more direct evidence to come in and give our readers feedback.
To diagnose "suspected cases" and "verified cases," we advise them to track and comply with the latest guidelines in their home countries.
Our team is always on hand to provide guidance.
Bangladesh has reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths due to the virus in a single day.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) said the number of recorded infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Merjidi Sabrina Flora said four men were among the dead, including a woman.
According to Dr Mir Zaidi, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60, and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said that two of those killed were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saif-ur-Rehman, the director of Bengali anti-corruption, who was taken care of at Kuwait's maternity hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaid-ul-Qadr said public transport would be closed for a long time from this coming week as part of an initial plan.
Initially, the closure of public transport started on March 26 and was scheduled to end on April 4.
Transportation of essential goods -- medical supplies, fuel, and food -- was still allowed.
On March 8, the first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded in two people who had returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, all three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than one million people globally.
On Thursday, data from Johns Hopkins University indicated that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection globally has exceeded one million.
About 52,000 deaths are linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and the first death related to the coronavirus in Zambia.
As of Thursday, North Korea had claimed it was one of the few countries to be free of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases, after 24 hours at 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
The United States has recorded more than 244,000 coronavirus cases, linked to 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported more than 1,000 U.S. deaths due to coronavirus infection as of Wednesday.
Across the world, countries have announced strict measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that payments to the Russians would continue until April 30 without work.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the national emergency by 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 for recovery, and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day: previously, the curfew was in effect from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand will impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state has extended its stay-at-home order until May 1.
Australia's stores have reduced the amount of toilet tissue paper in each transaction
On Sunday and Saturday, Australian store chains Walworth and Quills lowered the ban on the purchase of toilet paper in all stores nationally to two and one pack per transaction.
ALDI also introduced the limit of one pack, on Monday.
These limits were posted as messages on checkouts, and on the chain's Facebook pages.
Buyers had reported storing it in the event of a need for people's self-isolation due to fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
These changes followed the four-pack restrictions on each transaction introduced by Woolworths and the Coils last on March 4 and 5 respectively.
Quills, in a March 8 media release, reported that with the four-pack ban in place, "many stores are still selling within an hour of delivery," and called the demand "unprecedented," while ALDI called it "unprecedented" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a Woolworth's spokesman, last week's sales were "extremely high."
Costco's store in Canberra also limited last week's allowed number to two packs.
To reduce the shortage, the coils ordered larger packets from suppliers and increased the delivery chain, Woolworth ordered additional storage, while ADLI stored for special initial availability on planned Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers try to increase storage, but the local council's ban on delivery truck timings has made it difficult.
In addition to the increased production costs, they have increased the supply because suppliers try to meet the demand and do something special.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the storage exemption, some stores could not operate on specific Wednesdays.
Dr Gary Martimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said in a report on News.com.au that the stores fill up every night.
He said that toilet paper is a big thing, due to which it has a small amount of storage, and, when sold, leaves a vast space of shelves empty, which makes sense of a severe shortage.
Russell Zimmerman said in ABC News on Thursday, "Quails and Woolworths are under review [that] if there are a lot of things on the shelf, if products like toiletries and sanitizers can go [buy] and if they're in quantity, maybe you can reduce panic.
A crepe-giving recycled toilet tissue paper maker said last Wednesday that they would be without storage.
According to a report by News.com.au, Camberley Clark, who makes the tissue of the clinic toilet, and Solaris, who makes the sorbent, insisted that they were working 24/7 to maintain supply.
According to Domain.com, a property-buying site, some people who sell property in Melbourne offer free toilet paper to the first bidder at the auction, when buyers had time for a long weekend on International Workers' Day.
Printed in the daily Darwin, NT News' Thursday issue included eight-page encaustic tapes meant to be cut and used as toilet tissue paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, the stores were actually reluctant to impose restrictions, which they said they had no plans to introduce a ban on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman also said there was a high demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, handwashing and flour.
Similarly, on Sunday evening, outside of Australia, the purchase of the British supermarket was observed to be limited to a pack of two to 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the ongoing spread of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — a global pandemic.
While the term "pandemic" indicates the rapid spread of a disease, not the extent to which certain cases are dangerous, the World Health Organization stressed the need for governments to act.
All countries can still change the face of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize their people in response.
We are deeply troubled by the two dimensions of this disease, the extent of its aggravation and severity, and the worrying extent of the action against it.
According to Dr Tom Frieden, the former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "extraordinary."
"Except for influenza, no other respiratory virus has been found to have such a pattern from the beginning to the global outbreak," he said in his observations published in CNN in February.
Ghebreyesus expressed the same view, saying, "We have never seen a global epidemic that is preceded by the coronavirus."
"And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he continued.
The new outbreak came after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern in January.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the first outbreak, "What's important is that it's heading for further destruction."
The Associated Press reported that as of Thursday, the number of COVID-19 patients worldwide had reached 126,000, resulting in 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a variant of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, on December 2019, and declared a public health emergency on January 30, 2020, and was identified as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, nearly 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in nearly 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate in China is estimated at 4%, while globally it ranges from 13% in Algeria to 88% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Complications may include pneumonia and symptoms of severe difficulty breathing.
The period from the appearance of the disease to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can be in the range of two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Early treatment is symptomatic and supportive treatment. Suggested precautions include washing hands, covering your mouth while coughing, keeping a distance from other people, and monitoring and isolation for people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world have also been supportive of travel restrictions, quarantine, curfew enforcement, workplace risk control, and the closure of facilities.
The pandemic has disrupted many global socio-economic, religious, political and cultural events, and caused widespread shortages of goods due to mismanagement.
Schools and universities in 193 countries were either closed at the national level or locally, affecting about 99.4% of the world's population.
Misconceptions about the virus spread online, and there have been instances of discrimination and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of color and ethnicity in East and Southeast Asia, and those where the virus has been on the rise.
Low inflows and closure of large industries have led to reduced air density and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China, reported on December 31, 2019, a collection of pneumonia cases for an unknown reason, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of these cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and therefore are believed to be a breeding of zoonotic diseases.
The virus that caused the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that was closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first person to show no symptoms of the disease was a person who became ill on December 1, 2019.
Two-thirds of the initial cases reported in December 2019 were market-related.
On 13 March 2020, the South China Morning Post recommended in an unverified report that the incident of a 55-year-old man from Hubei province on 17 November 2019 may be the first. On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that although cases are decreasing in China, due to a sudden increase in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases from China has increased for the first time.
It is also possible to reduce the number of cases, especially in people with common symptoms of the disease.
On 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people aged 19 and under, accounting for 2.4% of the world's cases.The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the UK's population would be affected before it could be prevented from becoming an effective mob.
According to government protocols, the number of cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and their result has been confirmed to be positive.
As of 23 March, no country had tested 3% of its population, and many countries had an official policy not to test only those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 patients were undetected until January 23, and that unregistered patients were the source of infection in 79% of registered patients.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The primary re-production estimate (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
The study, published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, concluded it could be 5.7.
Most of the people infected with COVID-19 have recovered.
For those who do not have it, the duration from the onset of symptoms to death is 6 to 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
As of February 5, nearly 80% of deaths in China were among people over the age of 60 and 75% of people with pre-existing diseases, including heart disease and diabetes, the official death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic usually includes those who tested positive according to official protocols.
The exact number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher than this, because those deaths do not include people who die without testing - for example at home, in a nursing home, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic was higher than the official number of deaths from COVID-19, x4-5.
A spokesman for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "we know that [the reported death toll] is low," a statement confirming reports of a lower number of deaths in the United States. This type of mitigation reports is often found during the pandemic.
The first death outside mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia on February 14 in France.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had occurred outside mainland China, including in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than 40 countries and territories, except for the Southern Ocean, reported deaths from each continent. A number of joint measures are used to determine deaths.
The numbers vary with region and time, and are influenced by testing, treatment system quality, treatment options, post-pandemic time, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
Based on data from June Hopkins University, the global mortality and incidence ratio as of 10 April 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The number varies by region.
The ratio of cases and deaths in China from the onset of symptoms to the onset of disease (from 1-10 January 2020) has declined from 17.3% to 0.7% (for people with the onset of disease as of 1 February 2020) - other measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of people diagnosed with the disease and the infection-to-death ratio (IFR) that affects people.
These numbers are not for a specific period of time and are for a particular population from infection to the final solution of the case.
Many experts have tried to count this number for a specific population.
The Oxford University's Evidence-Based Medicine Center estimates that the overall mortality rate from infection in this pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this estimate is consistent with the results of the first various COVID-19 tests conducted in Germany, and with a statistical study analyzing the effects of testing on CFR projections.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The extent and extent of the pandemic is uncertain.
"Unchecked, the multiplicity of outbreaks usually rises like a plateau and then starts to decline when the disease is no longer found to be host," said MacKay Boone of Penn State University.
But it's impossible to say exactly when this will happen, so there's a reasonable plan at the moment."
Zhong Nanshan, the Chinese government's top medical adviser, insisted "it could end by June" if all countries were encouraged by the World Health Organization to follow its advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Charski told Adam of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine that SARS-CoV-2 "will likely continue to circulate for a year or two."
According to an Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more)."
William Schiffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I don't think it's likely that this coronavirus will disappear—completely—because it's easily transmissible" and that it "will turn into a seasonal disease, and come back every year."
The death of the returnee will depend on the extent of the affluence and its transmutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively unexplained and infected people can be asymptomatic.
Two common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include a sore throat, a sore throat, loss of ability to smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, coughing up blood, diarrhoea or blue chills.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list emergency symptoms: difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden cramping, difficulty waking up, and blurred vision in the face or lips; if these symptoms are present, immediate medical attention is recommended.
Some of these infected people may be asymptomatic, they may be considered as patients confirmed with test results without medical symptoms, so researchers have issued a recommendation that people who have come in contact with confirmed patients should be closely monitored and tested to avoid infection.
China's no-symptom disease ratio is estimated from a few numbers to 44 percent.
The incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) usually ranges from one to 14 days; it usually lasts five days. For example, the loss of sense of smell in people infected with COVID-19<0x2B> initially occurred in 30% of people, which later decreased to 15% of people.
Some details of the nature of the disease are still being worked out.
It is believed that the disease is initially caused by close contact and is caused by small droplets that develop when coughing, sneezing, or speaking; where the distance between close contact is 1 or 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that droplets can range from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet) without a drop.
Some people have suggested that the virus can also spread from small droplets that remain in the air for longer periods of time that are formed during speech. Breathing can also cause respiratory droplets, including during conversation, although the virus is not usually in the air.
These droplets can penetrate into the mouth or nose of nearby people or possibly into the lungs while inhaling.
Some medical procedures, such as infusion hose and artificial inhalation (CPR) through the mouth, can bring out the respiratory tract and thus can be airborne.
It can also occur when someone touches the affected surface and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there are concerns that it can spread through the face, the risk is considered to be very low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through an excreted female, which is highly contagious for three days before the onset of symptoms, although it can be transmitted before symptoms and in the final stages of the disease.
Since people can test positive up to three days before the onset of symptoms, it is believed that transmission of the disease is possible even before the appearance of effective symptoms.
Only a few confirmed cases have been reported from the laboratory, where there are no pre-existing symptoms, but contact tracing in some countries has revealed asymptomatic transmission.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease can spread, one person can usually infect two to three people - the virus can survive on different levels for hours to days.
In particular, the virus was identified on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, up to one day on cardboard and up to four hours on copper.
However, this period varies in humidity and temperature, and the test for COVID-19 in pets and other animals has come back positive.
There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from animals to humans, but British authorities recommend hand washing after contact with animals, as they do when interacting with other surfaces that have been exposed by infected people.
Severe respiratory symptoms coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, previously isolated from three people with pneumonia who belong to a group of acute respiratory illness in the city of Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the related physical coronavirus - outside of the human body, the virus can be eliminated with household soap, which dissolves its protective shell.
It is believed that his offspring are from animal diseases.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus belongs to the family of B-ta coronaviruses, which is genetically linked to two strains of bats in the family Farai.
On the overall genome level, it resembles 96% of the other bat coronavirus pneumonia (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one amino acid difference in parts of the genome in humans and pangolin viruses.
Comparing the complete genome to date, it has been found that most of the genetic material is shared between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is enough to prove that pangolins are the intermediate hosts of the virus.
The temporary diagnosis of infection from the virus can be based on symptoms of the disease, although confirmation from infected fluids or ICT X-rays is ultimately made via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan found that CT, although less specific but significantly more sensitive than PCR, has its own peculiarities over the functioning of other pneumonias and diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used for screens or as the first marigold test for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) at the same time.
This test is done on a respiratory tract or blood sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
Usually, this test is done through infusions, although it can also be used in the throat - several laboratories and companies are also developing a diagnostic test that detects antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been proven to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, Selex has developed a serological test that was approved for emergency use only in accredited laboratories.
Featuring reflections on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people with symptoms of the disease, symmetric peripheral ground glass opacity and absenteeism.
The Italian Radiology Society is building an international online database of photographic results of certified events.
Due to overlap with other infections such as the adenovirus, the identification of COVID-19 imaging without PCR confirmation is of limited character.
In a large study in China, the chest CT results were compared with PCR, which showed that although imaging is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, with the suggestion that it should be considered as a screening device in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based neural networks were created to detect the virus's visible features, both through radiography and CT.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining good personal hygiene, washing hands, washing eyes with unwashed hands, touching the nose or mouth, and coughing and sneezing in the tissue and tossing the tissue directly into the garbage bin.
Those who are already infected are advised to wear a surgical mask in public places.
Measures are also suggested to prevent transmission of the disease - many countries have restricted travel or avoided non-essential travel to other countries or to regions affected by the pandemic.
However, the virus has reached a stage of spread in the community in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus continues to spread within the community, and some communities don't know how or where they've been infected - health care workers, who are at risk of contracting the disease, are advised to stay in touch and take standard precautions about eye protection.
For this purpose, governments have raised privacy concerns over the use of mobile phone data at the site, with Amnesty International and 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for such surveillance to be limited.
As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups have been working on a privacy-friendly solution, such as using Bluetooth to access the user's living room from another mobile.
The user then receives a message if he or she has been close to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, inhaling water into the nose and swallowing with a mouthwash are not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, but many companies are working on the development of one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC often advises people to wash their hands with soap for 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are dry; before bedtime; and when someone cleans the nose, coughs, or sneezes.
This is because outside of the human body, the virus is killed by household soap when its protective shell explodes.
The CDC recommends the use of more alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol by volume, when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization (WHO) advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces should also be cleaned in several ways (stainless steel levels should be stopped for a minute in front of an disinfectant), which contains %62-71 ethanol, %50-100 isopropanol, %0.1 sodium hypochlorite, %0.5 hydrogen peroxide, and from 0.2 to %7.5 pyridoxide.
Other methods, such as benzalkonium chloride and chromic gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends disinfecting all areas, such as offices, toilets, shared spaces, shared electrical equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control, ATM machines, which are used by sick people, if a suspected or certified COVID case appears at a location, such as an office or a nursery.
Health organizations have recommended that people cover their mouth with their bent elbow or tissue while coughing and sneezing and immediately destroy such tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may be infected, as wearing masks limits both the size and distance of the droplets being emitted by the person affected, when he speaks, checks and coughs.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines on when and how to wear a mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virus expert at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask may reduce the likelihood of people touching their faces, which is a major source of infection if used without proper hand hygiene."
The World Health Organization recommends wearing masks only for healthy people if their health is at high risk, such as if they are looking at a COVID-19 patient, even though they admit that wearing a mask prevents people from touching their face.
Many countries have begun to encourage people to wear face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing an unsanitary face mask made of cloth - China has specifically recommended that healthy people in the public use decontaminated medical masks, especially when there is a possibility of other people approaching (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask while using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from entering the country without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested everyone to wear a face mask when going into public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for everyone to wear a mask when entering shops.
Israel has asked all residents to wear a face mask when going out in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks per day since mid-March, also requires passengers to wear masks on trains and buses running between cities from April 1.
In Panama, it is mandatory to wear a face mask while going out of the house, while in the houses it is also recommended to make masks for those who are unable to buy masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes disease control actions aimed at reducing the spread of infection by limiting close contact between individuals.
These include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, cinemas or shopping centers.
Individuals can apply social distancing practices while staying at home, avoiding crowds, not receiving greetings, and staying physically away from each other.
Many governments are imposing or advising social distancing in areas affected by the pandemic.
The U.S. government agencies and health organizations suggested that the maximum number of people gathering was quickly reduced from 250 people (where there were no known cases of COVID-19 in that area) to 50 people, which was later increased to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older people and those who are suffering from a physical illness or have had a period of isolation, such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory illness, high blood pressure and a weakened immune system. "This is the time to be more aware of the pandemic, and the CDC has advised them to stay at home.
The term "social distancing" began to draw people's attention to the idea that they should be completely isolated from the world, instead of encouraging them to interact with other people in alternative ways.
These include recommendations to only have sex with someone who has no symptoms of the virus or the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are suspected to be infected.
Health authorities have issued detailed guidelines for appropriate self-isolation, and many governments have mandated or suggested that the entire population living in an affected area be quarantined.
The strictest guidelines of self-quarantine have been issued for those who are in a serious danger group.
People who have come into contact with a COVID-19 patient and who have recently travelled to a country or region where there is widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the last possible disclosure.
Strategies for controlling an epidemic include prevention, control, or mitigation of stress.
The containment strategy is developed in the early stages of the pandemic and aims to identify and isolate infected people, introduce other infection control measures, and vaccinate them to prevent the disease from spreading to other people in the population.
When it is not possible to prevent the disease from spreading further, the effort enters the mitigation phase: measures are put in place to reduce its spread, and the health care system and its impact on society are minimized.
Both prevention and mitigation measures should be taken at the same time.
More stringent measures need to be put in place to suppress the pandemic by reducing the spread of the pandemic from 1 to less than the primary outbreak. Part of the management of infectious disease is to try to slow the rise of the epidemic, called the early onset of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk for health services, which are being overwhelmed, and provides more time for vaccine development and treatment discovery.
Non-individual measures that can regulate the spread of the epidemic include preventive measures, such as restrictions on hand washing, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; social measures aimed at physical distancing, such as school closures and mass gatherings; community engagement to encourage people to take such measures.
Other countries have taken a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has made large-scale screenings and local quarantines and issued warnings on the movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to those affected who quarantined themselves and imposed fines on those who did not.
The comparison between the UK and the US shows that mitigation (the spread of the disease is decreasing but not ending) and pressure (the rise of the global epidemic) are major challenges.
More and more mitigation policies can reduce the peak of health demand by two-thirds and the mortality rate by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of the health system.
Pressure may be prioritized as a transition, but it should continue as long as the virus continues to circulate in the human population (or as long as a vaccine is available, if it is first) otherwise it quickly returns to recovery when measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic cause social and economic costs.
There is no specific antiviral drug approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop it, including experiments on existing drugs.
The use of anti-cold medicines, drinking more water and resting helps to eliminate the symptoms of the disease.
Depending on the severity of the disease, it may be necessary to get oxygen, inoculated in the vein, and help with breathing.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Many compounds that have previously been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being researched to treat COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has also said that "some traditional and household tips" can relieve SARS-CoV-19 diseases.
The increase in the capacity and adaptability of health care providers to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as a fundamental step in responding to the pandemic.
The ECDC and the World Health Organization's Regional European Union Office have issued guidelines for resource change at various stages for hospitals and primary health centers, including focusing on laboratory services on the ability to test for COVID-19, rejection of optional bed-response when possible, isolation and isolation of COVID-19 positive patients and availability of intensive care through quarantine and personnel training.
There are many theories as to where the first event (i.e. zero patient) would have started.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on December 1, 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually began to rise.
Most of these cases are reported from the wholesale sea market, where live animals are also sold, and there is a theory that the virus came from this type of animal; in other words, the virus is a species of zoonotic disease. The collection of pneumonia cases of unknown cause was observed on December 27 by Django Django, a doctor in the Hubei Provincial Hospital, on December 26
On December 30, a group of doctors at the central Wuhan hospital warned their colleagues about the "SARS-like coronavirus."
Eight of them, including Le Winleag, were warned by police for spreading fake news, and one, Ie Fan, was reprimanded by his superiors for spreading misinformation.
Later, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public announcement on December 31 and notified the World Health Organization.
By late January, Wuhan's health authorities had reported enough cases of unexplained pneumonia to order an investigation, with the number of cases doubling almost every seven and a half days in the early stages of the outbreak.
The virus spread to other provinces of China in late January and mid-January 2020, with arrivals and departures played a key role for China's New Year as Wuhan was the main interchange of means of transportation and rail.
On January 20, China reported 140 new cases in just one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data later showed that 6,174 people had already shown symptoms of the disease as of January 20, 2020.

On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus, several U.S. stock indexes, including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 Andex, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, reported the sharpest decline since 2008, where the Dow dropped 1,191 points, its biggest one-day drop since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three indexes fell more than 10% over the weekend.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Stock markets fell again due to fears of the coronavirus, with the biggest fall on March 16.
Many people think that there is a possibility of an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.
Central banks are reacting more quickly than in the 2008 financial crash.
Tourism is one of the most affected by travel restrictions, the closure of public places, including tourist centers, and travel restrictions by governments globally.
As a result, a number of airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, cancelled flights due to low demand, while British regional airline Flyby also crashed.
The impact on the marine tourism industry was never seen before.
Several railway stations and ports have also been closed.
The outbreak came at a time with Chunyan, a major travel season associated with Chinese New Year celebrations.
A number of events, with a large crowd to attend, were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year's Eve, in which private companies closed their shops and tourist centers, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Several Lunar year celebrations and tourist centers, including Forbidden City and traditional dome fairs in Beijing, were closed to avoid crowds.
Municipal and regional officials in 24 of China's 31 provinces extended New Year's Eve deadlines until February 10, and instructed most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised the level of response to the infectious disease to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, under which schools were closed until March and New Year's celebrations were canceled.
Access to retail outlets in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% decline.
This reduced pedestrian traffic to shopping centres by 33-43% in March compared to February.
Shoppers around the world have implemented additional measures, such as additional cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to test buyers' temperatures, and cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the global pandemic could put another 14 to 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, when the epidemic peaked in Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
More than 300 million Chinese rural migrants have been trapped in homes in remote parts of China's Hubei province, leaving more than 10 million Americans unemployed and applying for government aid in March 2020.
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates that the coronavirus disease could cause a loss of 47 million in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%.The lockdown in India has left millions of workers ( daily wage earners) unemployed.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. About half a million companies in Germany also put their workers on a government-sponsored short-term work scheme called Corz<0xC3><0xA9>sbet.
France and the UK have also adopted a compensation scheme for Germany's short-term work.
Globally, the arts and cultural heritage sectors have been hit hard by the pandemic, which has also affected the activities of individuals, including institutions, both in terms of employment and autonomy.
The arts and culture organizations sought to maintain their mission (often with public support) to provide society with access to cultural heritage, to protect their employees and the public, and to help artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, art venues and other cultural institutions in various directions around the world were closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and programs were canceled or postponed.
Another recent and sharpest failure of the disease has been the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that the blessed week in Rome, which falls on the last week of the Lent season for Christians, had been canceled.
Many pastors advised older Christians to stay at home instead of attending worship on Sundays; some churches began broadcasting church worship over the radio, live TV, or online, while others were in a car offering worship services.
As soon as Roman Catholic priests in Rome closed their churches and small churches and St. Peter's Square became empty of Christian visitors, other religious institutions also closed their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and monasteries.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the pandemic and closed shrines, while Saudi Arabia closed entry to foreign visitors, and the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused significant disruption to the world's sporting calendar since World War II.
Major sporting events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA, season, and 2019-20 NHL sessions, have been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the activity "will be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but will not be held after the summer of 2021."
Due to this, many gamblers have moved online, and there has been a significant increase in the new sign-ups of many gambling online sites. The entertainment industry has also been affected, many music groups have postponed or canceled their concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as those on Broadway, have also suspended all performances.
Many artists have found ways to work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as a live streaming event, or to create web-based "matches" so that artists can perform, spread, and advertise their work.
Online, many memes based on the idea of coronavirus have spread as many turn to humor and distraction in this uncertain situation.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a lot of prejudice, fear and racism from xenophobia strangers, towards Chinese and East Asian people, Europe, the United States and other countries where the epidemic has intensified.
There have been incidents of fear, suspicion and opposition, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
According to February reports (while most of the cases were limited to China) Chinese people have been subjected to racist sentiments in various groups around the world, whose justification for the virus deserves to be claimed in return.
Anti-Chinese sentiment has also been seen in some African countries.
Many of the residents in Wuhan and Hubei have reported differences in their behavior on a regional basis.
For the Chinese, both online and offline, and those in areas affected by the virus have been supported.
After the outbreak and spread to other countries, people in Italy, the first country in Europe to become infected with COVID-19, may be susceptible to such suspicions and fears.In an effort to curb the disease, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed petitions seeking to ban Chinese people from entering their countries.
The hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan is trending on Twitter in Japan.
Chinese people, as well as other Asians living in the UK and the US, have reported incidents of abuse and humiliation on the basis of racism.
US President Donald Trump has been criticised for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus," with critics calling the term racist and anti-China.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying evacuated Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sad.
Students coming from northern India, bordering China, and studying in India's major cities have been exposed to harassment related to the spread of the coronavirus.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's West Bengal state unit, stated that China had destroyed nature and that "this is why God has taken revenge on them."
The statement was later condemned by the Chinese ambassador in Kolkata, calling it "misleading" and since the pandemic in China, fear of foreigners has been fueled by feelings of racism from non-Chinese residents, with foreigners calling it a "foreign garbage" that is "sucking."
Many paywall newspapers have removed them for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Publishers of many scientific materials made scientific papers related to the spread available to all.
Many scientists quickly sent their results to servers, such as bioRixiv, before publication.

Laboratory tests for the respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus include procedures that detect the presence of the virus and the antibodies that cause the infection
RT-PCR confirms the presence of the virus as samples, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm a very recent or active infection.
Antibodies (cyrology) can also be used to diagnose and monitor the population.
Antibody tests show how many people had the disease, including those who had so few symptoms that were too rare to report or those who showed no symptoms.
Based on the results of these tests, the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunity in a population can be determined.
Due to limited tests, as of March 2020, no country has reliable data on the spread of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a huge difference in how many tests have been carried out between countries.
There is considerable variation in the death rate reported due to this variant, which is likely to be higher than estimated in some countries.
Tests on respiratory samples using real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) can be obtained in a variety of ways, including nasopharyngeal swabs or saliva samples.
Results are usually available in a few hours to two days.
The PT-PCR test performed by the throat is reliable only in the first week of illness.
Later, when it begins to grow in the lungs, the virus disappears in the throat.
For those who have been tested the second week, alternatively sample material can be used from deep airways through the suction catheter or a cough up material (thook).
The first PCR tests were developed in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) at the charity's site in Berlin, which became the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenbiotech developed a clinical grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
It searches for the "E" gene that is transmitted by beta coronavirus, and the RdRP gene is specific to SARS-CoV-2. The TGI Group was one of the first companies in China to receive emergency use approval for its PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit from the China National Medical Products Administration (CDC) International. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States
One in three tests in the older version of test ketone failed due to poor chemical interaction, and fewer than 100 samples a day could be obtained throughout February 2020 due to disruption of tests at the CDC in Atlanta.
Tests using the two-components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and this was until state and local laboratories were allowed to test.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization, and U.S. business laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics has made COVID-19 testing available across the country till March 9, 2020.
Value limits have not been announced; the collection and further processing of samples should be in line with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was created and developed by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic reported that it had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics obtained FDA approval for the test, which could be done in a large number of 3.5 hours, i.e., a machine could do about 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar authorization to Holographic, LabCorp and Themo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid similarly obtained the EUA from the FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method yields positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase the number of these machines to 50,000 tests per day, a test that uses monoclonal antibodies that are specifically limited to the novel coronavirus's nucleocaped protein (N protein) is being developed in Taiwan.
The conclusion of the written content review in March 2020 is that "in the initial stage, chest radiograph diagnosis is of no significance, however [CT computed tomography] is possible before symptoms appear."
The general characteristics of CT are two-way multi-lobe ground glass misting, which includes disproportionate and back-to-back distribution.
It grows as the disease progresses, full domination, insane smoothness, and stability.
Wuhan, where the pandemic originated, in a study comparing between PCR and CT, suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its characteristics similar to those of pneumonia and disease stages.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a first priority for the diagnosis of COVID-19."
Immunity to infection is the partial response of antibodies to IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect infections in people who have had symptoms for up to seven days, to determine immunity, and for people who are under close surveillance.
In many clinical laboratories, high-yield automated systems will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will be limited to the production rate for each system.
For CLT, only a single sample of blood is usually used, although many samples can be used to detect strength immunity.
For PoCT, a sample of blood is usually obtained by pressing a needle on the skin.
On March 26, 2020, the FDA gave a list of 29 entities that provide notifications to the agency and are therefore now able to distribute their antibody tests.
In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were approved by Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
It has the ability to test hundreds of samples in a few hours, so it is faster than traditional PCR to detect the RNA virus.
In early April, the UK found that none of the test kits purchased were sufficiently accurate for use.
Hong Kong has introduced a scheme that will allow suspected patients to stay at home, "emergency department will give the patient a sample tube of the test tube," the patient will receive a diagnosis of the disease, he will spit it out, send it back to the patient, and after some time the patient will be able to recover from the infection.
The National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians in Germany said on March 2 that it has the capacity to conduct 12,000 tests per day in a normal setting and 10,700 tests last week.
When it comes to health insurance, the cost is covered by Medicare.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct 160,000 tests per week.
The drive-in test was offered in several major cities till March 19.
The number of tests carried out in Germany as of 26 March 2020 was not known, as only positive results are reported.
According to the first lab survey, the calendar tested 483,295 samples by week 12/2020, and this week more than 10,000 samples were tested for Ebola and 33,491 samples (%6.9) were tested positive for 2-SARS-CoV. "In Israel, Technion and Rambam Hospital have developed and adopted a mechanism to test samples from 64 patients at the same time, all of which were positive.
<0x7B>NS<0x7D>
The Wuhan laboratory method was immediately adopted by Huo-Yan Libertarians in Shenzhen, Tianjin, and Shanghai, thus in 12 cities throughout China in total.
Origami Assays has released open-source multifunctional designs that can test 1,122 COVID-19 patients with only 93 attempts. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without robotic fluid handlers.
As of March, shortages and insufficient reagents have become an obstacle to large-scale testing in the EU, the UK and the US.
As a result, some authors have examined the protocol for the preparation of the sample, which allows the sample to be heated to 98 C (208 F) for 5 minutes to emit the RNA genome or chromosome for further testing.
Such a drive-thru capability and BGI (based on their China-based Emergency Detection Laboratories "HUO-Yan") benefited from both large population-generated laboratories.
Established in 14 days, it carried out 1,000 RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to operate on such a large scale outside China.
Various testing techniques were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States to target different parts of the coronavirus' genetic profile.
The World Health Organization used the German structure for low-income countries, which do not have the resources to make cuts.
The German recipe was published on January 17, 2020, and the U.S.-made disease control protocols were not available until January 28, delaying available tests in the U.S., raising concerns about the quality of test kits in China and the U.S. in the early days of the outbreak, and that countries and Australia could not provide the kits despite recommendations and demands from health experts.
On the other hand, experts say that a large supply of testing in South Korea has reduced the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Over the past few years, the South Korean government has ramped up testing capacity in private-sector laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for strengthening testing programs to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing the demand for testing due to the high spread of the virus, causing tens of thousands of tests to be halted at U.S. private laboratories, and putting pressure on the supply of wound-clearing tubes and chemical interactions.
In March 2020, China reported a problem with the accuracy of its test kits.
There were "errors" in the CDC kits made in the United States, the government then removed the office barriers that led to private testing. Spain bought the kits from Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not accurate.
The firm explained that the reason for the incorrect results was not to properly use the defects or cuts in the collection of samples.
Spain's ministry said the wrong results-bearing kits would be removed and replaced with a testing kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy, where 80% of the state Czechs bought from China gave false results.
Turkey's health ministry's Atas Kara said the cuts that Turkey had purchased from China had a "very high error rate" and were "not put into use."The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
If the test results are positive, the efforts to trace the quarantined individuals and those who came in contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected patients yielded good results.
In the Italian town of Vo, where the first death from COVID-19 was reported, researchers from the entire population, which consisted of about 3,400 people, were tested twice for at least ten days.
Nearly half of those tested showed no symptoms, and all of the detected cases were quarantined.
New cases of infection have been completely eliminated due to limited travel to a particular human group.
Due to extensive contact tracing, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic has had far less impact on Singapore than the developed world, where there were no strict restrictions, such as forced closures of restaurants and retail businesses.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore began advising citizens to stay at home from March 28, but schools reopened on time after the holidays ended on March 23.
Many other countries have also overcome the pandemic through stricter measures such as contact tracing, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but not stricter lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have tested higher, higher mortality rates have lower mortality rates, probably because these countries have been able to detect people with little or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories dealing with COVID-19 send their top five positive and ten negative COVID-19 samples to the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of these 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The column "% of positive tests" in the chart below relates to a country's testing policy.
The country that only tests people who are hospitalized will have a higher percentage of positive tests than the country that tests all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, will take them all the same.
Hand washing (or hand washing) is also known as hand hygiene, the purpose of this process is to clean your hands with soil, grease, germs, or other non-essential materials.
On some "essential occasions", frequent hand washing with soap a day prevents many diseases from spreading, for example diarrhea and cholera germs from entering the mouth.
People may also suffer from respiratory diseases such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
There are five essential occasions in a day when it is important to wash your hands with soap: before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning the baby's bottom or changing diapers, before feeding, before and after preparing food, or after touching raw meat, fish, or chicken.
If water and soap are not available, hands can also be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends the following:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after the death of a patient.
After cleaning a child using the toilet or changing diapers.
After coughing, sneezing, or coughing, the nose is thoroughly cleaned.
After touching an animal, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hygiene refers to the hygiene of medical procedures in accordance with the principles of hygiene.
Washing hands before eating or taking medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
Medically, the main purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microbes that cause disease) and chemicals that can harm or spread disease.
This is especially true for people who are in the food or medical field, but it is also a good habit for the general public.
Hand washing has many medical benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
A decrease in the number of children born at home.
A 2013 study showed that improving hand washing habits significantly improved height in children under the age of five.
In developing countries, simple changes in habits can reduce child mortality due to respiratory and diarrhoea-related diseases, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce mortality by up to 50% due to these diseases.
An intervention that encourages hand washing can reduce mortality by one-third from diarrheal events, and can be compared to the provision of clean water in low-income areas.
Hand washing with soap can reduce the mortality rate by up to 48%. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infection (ARI). It is an automated practice that can be practiced in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the leading causes of death in children under the age of five, kills about 1.8 million children each year.
Both diarrhea and pneumonia cause about 3.5 million child deaths annually.
According to UNICEF, changing the habit of washing hands before and after a meal to a nature reserve can save more lives by using a vaccine or medically interfering with it, i.e. a half reduction in deaths due to diarrhoea and a quarter reduction in deaths due to acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is usually part of the other health and hygiene items, namely water, sanitation and hygiene programs (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against skin diseases that are transmitted directly from the mitral valve.
A small disadvantage of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can damage the skin by drying the skin.
According to a 2012 Danish study, excessive hand washing can lead to skin itching, which is commonly found in people who are in the medical field.
Frequent hand washing is also seen as a sign of excessive anxiety (OCD).
There are five critical occasions in a day when it is important to wash hands with soap to reduce waste and mouth-to-mouth transmission: after using the bathroom (difficulty or soreness), after cleaning the baby from the bottom (dipper change), before feeding the baby, before and after feeding, and before and after preparing food, touching or eating raw meat, fish or raw meat.
Other occasions when hand washing should be done correctly to prevent transmission of the disease include: before and after handling the wound; after sneezing, coughing or nosebleeding; after handling animal waste or animal waste; and after handling garbage.
Many countries have low rates of hand washing with soap.
According to a 2015 study on hand washing in 54 countries, an average of 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. According to a 2014 study, Saudi Arabia has the highest rate of washing with soap, 97 percent of the time, the United States is in the middle, and China has the lowest rate of growth - 77 percent. Many behaviors change the way children wash their hands so that they can wash their hands at critical times.
The mandatory "health protection program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the massive promotion of children's health and education.
The national program includes twice a year washing hands with soap, daily brushing teeth with fluoride, along with pesticides.
It has also been successfully applied in Indonesia.
The process of removing germs from the skin has been improved by mixing soap and detergents in the water.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier of degradation and to increase the resolution.
Just water is insufficient for skin cleansing because fats and proteins, which are organic soil components, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleanliness, however, is with the help of proper flow of water.
In solid soap, due to re-use, bacteria may be present due to past use.
A few studies that have studied the transfer of bacteria from solid contaminated soaps say that it cannot be transferred because the bacteria leaves with the foam.
The CDC continues to say that "liquid soap without hand control is preferable."
Anti-bacterial soaps have been greatly promoted in the health conscious public.
There is no evidence yet that using the recommended bactericidal drugs produces antibiotic-resistant organics in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which is resistant to organics.
So if antibacterial soaps don't choose antibiotic-resistant, they won't be as effective as they've been said.
In addition to the normalization of dilute substances and skin rejuvenation, more sophisticated formulations can contain PH as a regulator, bactericidal active benzoic acid can be as simple as acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid, and also as a skin conditioner (aloe vera, vitamin, menthol, plant extracts).
Hot water is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37<0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, semi-hot, soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water to remove the natural oil, which absorbs soil and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies say that semi-hot water is not effective at reducing germs by hand.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent.
In the 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, disinfectant hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most isopropyl alcohols are based on ethanol mixed into a thickened compound, such as a carbomer (multi-acrylic acid mixture) into a jelly-like substance or in a liquid such as glycerin.
Adding oxides to dissolved hydrogen increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers with alcohol content ranging from 60 to 95% are effective disinfectants.
Alcohol-containing sinuses kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), TB, and some viruses (HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinoviruses, vaccines, influenza, hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcoholic sanitizers containing 70% alcohol (a reduction of 3.5 logs, which is equivalent to 35 decibels reduction) kill 99.97 bacteria 30 seconds after use and 1 minute after use kill 99.99% to 99.99% (a reduction of 4 to 5 logs) of bacteria.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective for Norwalk, or Norwalk, which is the most common cause of small bowel inflammation.
Mix the front and back of both hands and the middle and last parts of all fingers together for about 30 seconds, until the material, foam, or gel dry.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with hand sanitizer, especially when hands are apparently contaminated.
The reason for the rapid use of such materials is their ease of use and ability to kill germs quickly; however, they should not be considered an alternative to formal hand washing, and should be used when soap and water are not available.
Excessive use of alcohol-based sanitizers can dry up quickly, unless the formula includes creams and/or wetting ingredients.
Glycerin and/or other creams can be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate the drying effect of alcohol.
Clinical experiments have shown that the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, including creams, reduces skin irritation and dryness compared to soaps or anti-microbial detergents.
In the case of a lot of sensitivity to various skin diseases or alcohol, or because alcohol contains addictive substances, allergic reactions can sometimes occur.
They had a tendency to wash their hands with soap and water because they were less prone to inflammatory skin diseases.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water-based agents are not able to clean organic materials, they only disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective at preventing the spread of many germs as soap and water, as germs are on hand.
The effectiveness of the alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends largely on the ingredients and composition, and historically it has not been very effective.
In recent times, the compositions used in benzyl quinone chloride have, unlike alcohol, seen overall antimicrobial functionality after use, and after repeated use, perhaps due to a skin-derived reaction, decreased performance.
In many low-income communities, people don't buy soap and use ashes or clay instead.
The ash and soil can be more effective than just water, but less so than soap.
There is a risk that if the soil or ash is contaminated by germs, it may increase the risk of disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms alkaline solution after being mixed with water.
WHO recommends ash or clay in case there is no soap.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommended hand washing regimen, in order to prevent the spread of the disease, consists of the following:
Wash your hands with warm or cold water.
Too much water is recommended because standing water can be contaminated, while water temperature does not matter.
Rub the hands with a reasonable amount of soap, including the back of the hands, the middle places of the fingers, and the lower part of the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and research has shown that people wash their hands better when they use soap instead of just water.
Hold for at least 20 seconds.
Mixing causes friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and more germs are removed by rubbing for a longer time.
Clean with plenty of water.
Washing hands in the basin can cause re-infection.
Clean with a dry towel or allow the air to dry.
Wet and damp hands can be easily re-contaminated. Commonly left parts include the thumb, wrist, spaces between the fingers, and around the fingernails.
Artificial nails and semi-nude nail polish can be a source of germs.
Moisturized lotions are usually recommended to protect the hands from dryness; dry skin can damage the skin, which can increase the risk of infection transmission.
Where tap water and/or soap are not available, many low-cost facilities can be provided, such as inserting water from a hanging canister or lumber-like vegetable with suitable holes, and/or using ash as needed in developing countries.
Tippy-tap is a simple technology that has a jug hanging from a rope and a lever moving from the foot that pours a little bit of water over a tick of hands and soap.
Effective hand drying is part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about what is the most effective way to dry in public sanitisers.
Most research suggests that paper towels are better than electric dryers, which are often present in purification chambers.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, and was sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium, a paper towel industry, which included paper towels, hot-air hand dryers, and modern jet-air hennad dryers to offer hygienic standards.
After hand washing and drying with a hot air dryer, the rate of bacteria on fingernails increased by an average of 194%, and 254% on palms.
Drying from the jet air dryer resulted in a 42% increase in the rate of bacteria on fingernails and 15% on palms.
After hand washing and drying with tissue paper, the total number of bacteria on the pads of the fingers was reduced by an average of 76 percent and by 77 percent on the palms. The scientists also tested to prove whether each type of drying method had the potential to contaminate other wash-room users and the wash-room environment.
The jet air dryer, which emits air from the unit at the claimed speed of 180m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing germs out of the hands and unit, and can pollute the environment of other users of the purifier and the purifier up to 2 meters away.
The hot-air hand dryer can spread germs up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
A 2005 study by TUV Produkt und Umwelt examined various hand-drying methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria occurred after hand drying:
There are many hand dryer manufacturers of different dryers, and the dryers have been compared to paper towels.
Hand washing with hand sanitised paper is an alternative in the absence of soap and water.
Alcohol-based sanitizers contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing was made mandatory by Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis after discovering its effectiveness in the hospital environment (1846).
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to hospital staff to remind them to wash their hands when they forget.
According to a study, their use reduced the rate of infection.
Medically, hand washing is for at least 15 seconds, soap and water or gel should be used in a special amount to make foam and rub each part of the hand.
The fingers of the hands should be rubbed against each other.
If there is a mole in the fingernails, a hard-boiled brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water in the hands, it is important to wash them well with water and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to shut off the water (and to open the back door if necessary).
This will not cause the hands to become infected again after they have been touched on these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in a healthcare setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("inheritance") and prevent them from being transmitted.
According to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine, the rate of hand washing in the medical environment is also unacceptably low, with a large number of doctors and nurses who forget to wash their hands before touching patients in the usual way, thus becoming a means of transmitting germs.
According to a study, proper hand washing and other simple methods can reduce urinary tract infections by up to 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a paper showing the right way to wash and wash hands in the health sector.
The draft guidance on hand hygiene by the agency can be seen on their website for public comment.
A related review was done by Whitby et al.
Commercial tools can check and verify hand hygiene, if such an action is required.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has listed five ways to wash your hands:
In the case of blood/blood
Prior to the outbreak of cholera, and
After taking care of the patient. The addition of disinfectant chemicals in the soap ("medicated" or "antimicrobial" soap) is the task of killing the germs.
There is a need for disinfection where there is a lot of antibiotic-resistant organisms before or after surgery. For the operation to "cleanse" your hands, it is necessary to have a tissue that can be opened and closed without touching your hands, cleaned with chlorhexidine or iodine, washed with chlorhexidine or iodine, cleaned with a disinfectant for drying after hand washing.
All jewelry should be removed.
In this process, the hands are washed from the wrist to the elbows, usually 6-2 minutes.
Long-term rubbing (10 minutes) is not required.
When water is being poured on the middle of the arm, be sure not to turn back to the hands.
When the washing of hands is complete, the hands are dried with an sterile cloth and surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands before and after seeing the patient, or to apply disinfectant to the hands.
To control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, research found that the highest benefits of hand hygiene came from the first 20% washing, and that when this rate was increased from 35%, there was little added benefit.
The use of simple soaps showed three times more effectiveness than anti-bacterial soaps in the transmission of bacterial infectious disease in the diet. By comparing alcohol-based solutions and antibacterial soaps every 30 seconds of hand rubbing, it was found that the anti-bacterial soap reduced hand rub by 26% compared to alcohol-based soaps.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based solutions to remove H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores from the hands. In health-related places, if hand hygiene is improved, it will require hand-washing, hand-washing, and hand-washing.
More research is needed to determine which measures are more effective in a variety of health settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered to be a low-cost, good health, and even a means of getting good nutrition, with the goal of reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke.
However, due to the lack of a constant supply of water, soap and handwashing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces, it is a major challenge for everyone to adopt the global handwashing habit.
For example, handwashing near a private or public toilet is very rare in most rural areas of Africa, although there are many low-cost ways to make handwashing places possible.
However, the reason for the low rate of hand washing can also be due to a habitual firmness rather than a lack of soap and water.
The motivation and publicity of hand washing with soap can influence decision-making, create awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and create far-reaching changes in the behavior of the population.
Monitoring and testing are necessary to make this effective.
A formal study of 70 students found that LMICs are more effective at working in a particular community, while social marketing advertising is less effective. A style of handwashing advertising in schools is a “three-star approach” by UNICEF, with students encouraged to take simple and low-cost health measures to ensure that they follow their own rules.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can reach second and then third stars.
Making handwashing spaces can be part of the handwashing campaign, which aims to reduce diseases and deaths in children.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of the publicity campaign aimed at behavioral change. In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged handwashing emoji adoption.
Some research has found that ignoring DALYs in developing countries is less cost-effective overall than hand washing.
However, according to one review, promoting hand washing with soap is more cost-effective than managing water and its drainage.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for those who are in an unsafe situation, such as mothers who have just given birth or injured soldiers in hospital - was first recognized in the middle of the 19th century by the first two primary forms of hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria.
At that time, most people still believed that the cause of infection was smell.
In the 1980s, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, due to food-borne illnesses and public health infections, promoted more intensive hand hygiene as an important means of preventing the spread of infection.
The swine flu in 2009 and the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries that hand washing with soap is essential to prevent such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "correct hand-washing techniques" hung outside public toilets in hand-washing areas, in the toilet of office buildings, and at airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing one's hands of" means that a person declares not to take responsibility for something or to say anything.
The parable is related to the Bible in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate expressed his disapproval of the decision to hang Jesus on the cross, but it later became a proverb in English-speaking society.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth is forced to wash her hands in an attempt to clean up an imaginary scar, which reveals her confusion of conscience due to her crime of killing her husband.
It has also been found that people tend to wash their hands more often than others, after recalling or considering unethical practices, and that hand washing is of great importance.
Furthermore, those who wash their hands after such thoughts are less likely to engage in other activities of "cleaning", such as voluntary work.
Religions also recommend hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, i.e. the use of soapy water for hand washing, is characteristic of many religions: such as the Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD> Faith, Hinduism, Judaism, Tawila in Judaism, Nitil<0xC3><0xA2>t Yad<0xC3><0xA2>m, Lavabo in Christianity and some health practices according to Islam.
In Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands after using the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands before and after every meal.
The Dangers of Working in the Workplace for COVID-19
Controlling risks at work for COVID-19 refers to the implementation of professional safety and health measures to protect against the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate control of risks in workplaces depends on the nature of the workplace and work, risk assessment of the means of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and in workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-disclosure risk jobs are those with minimal professional contact with the public and other co-workers, suggesting basic measures to prevent infection, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing etiquette, and keeping the work environment clean and germ-free.
The mid-disclosure risk is jobs that are in contact with people who are not known to be infected with COVID-19, but may be affected by social transmission and international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the public, such as schools, work environments in densely populated areas, and more retail spaces.
In addition to the basic infection prevention measures for this planet, risk management includes high-performance air filters for air movement, protection from sneeze, and personal protective equipment if a person is exposed to COVID-19.
OSHA considers the appearance of health care and morgue workers to be at greater risk if workers collect or maintain samples from a known or suspected person with or following an aerosol-producing procedure.
Appropriate measures will be taken to control the risk for these workers, such as rooms with negative air pressure, and personal protective equipment depending on the nature of the work.
There are many possible effects of the COVID-19 outbreak in the workplace.
Workers may be invisible due to the risk of getting sick, the safety of others, or the fear of being exposed to illness.
Trading methods may vary, depending on the demand for goods and also on the acquisition of those goods (such as purchases in low-altitude times, or delivery or draw-through facilities).
Finally, geographically, there may be disruption in the supply of goods from areas severely affected by COVID-19. A plan to prepare for and respond to infectious disease may be put in place to guide preventive actions.
Plans identify risk levels associated with different workplaces and job functions, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community setting, and risk factors for individual workers such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
It also outlines ways to control these outbreaks and emergency plans for the situation that are necessary to deal with these risks.
Preparation and response plans for infectious disease may be the subject of national or regional proposals.
To reduce the transmission between staff in response to an epidemic, protect those who are at risk due to poor health complications, and reduce the ill effects associated with business activities and supplies.
In the community where the business is located, the severity of the disease affects the response to take.
The risk management classification framework is very effective in occupational safety and health, so that group risks can be effectively controlled.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are put in place, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal safety equipment.
The set of controls is designed to isolate employees from work-related risks, without relying on their behavior, and may be the most cost-effective solution for the application.
Administrative control refers to a change in the policy and procedure of the work, which requires action from the worker or owner.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative control, but may help prevent some appearances.
All types of PPE should be selected on the basis of the risk to workers, properly installed, if applied (e.g., a sanitizing device), constantly and properly worn, continuously cared for and replaced, as needed, if properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-disclosure risk jobs tend to be in minimal professional contact with the public and other co-workers.
The basic measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and complete hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing habits, including covering their mouths when coughing and sneezing, providing tissue and litter, encouraging phone calls, or managing frequent attendance and, if necessary, other workers.
The identification and isolation of potentially infected people is a worrying step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of severe respiratory illness stay at home until employees have at least 24 hours of fever, fever symptoms, or other symptoms without using fever or other symptom-reducing medications, and that health care policies are flexible to allow employees to see sick family members.
According to OSHA, those at risk of mid-disclosure are jobs that require close or continuous contact from people who are not known to be suspected or infected with COVID-19, from a distance of six feet (1.8 meters), but may be due to community transmission around the business or be affected by SARS-CoV-2, or because the individual has a recent international travel where COVID-19 has a large scale.
This includes workers who are in contact with the public, such as in schools, working from home, working from home, working from the workplace to the workplace to the workplace to the workplace to the

The use of respirators in this group of at-risk workers is rare.
If a person falls sick on an airplane, proper control means keeping the sick person at a distance of 6 feet from others, keeping one member of staff apart for the patient, and presenting a face mask to the sick person or telling the patient to cover their mouth and hands with tissue while coughing or sneezing.
When returning from a sick passenger or touching body fluids or possibly contaminated surfaces, the crew must wear disposable gloves and possibly additional personal protective equipment, if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a bag made for this purpose, and contaminated surfaces should be subsequently cleaned and disinfected. For commercial vessels, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk management includes postponing travel in case of illness, and isolating yourself and having a fever or other symptoms.
The CDC recommends short-term closures for schools and child care centers to ensure that if an infected person has come into the school building, even if they have not spread the virus, they are cleaned or disinfected.
When transitioning from small to medium-sized viruses, social distancing strategies can be applied, such as outdoor activities, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or music classes, or canceling meals in cafeterias, increasing the distance between desks, limiting the hours of arrival and departure, and isolating symptoms such as avoiding unnecessary visits to the office, and isolating children.
When there is a substantial shift in the local community, long-term school closures can be considered in addition to social distancing strategies. Law enforcement personnel who are performing their daily activities are considered to have a lower immediate health risk, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officers, who have to contact people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, are recommended to follow the same guidelines for emergency technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during the incision, workers should clean and disinfect their duty belts and gear using household cleaning spray or wipe before re-use, and follow the standard implementation procedure for using the used PPE and destroying the contents and washing clothes.
According to OSHA, some health centers and dead-end workers are more or less at risk of disclosure.
High-disclosure risk jobs include health delivery, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become very high-disclosure risks when workers take aerosol-making action, or collect or manage samples of known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
In aerosol-forming action, enter the duct, cough procedures, examination of the throat ducts, certain dental procedures and inspections, or collection of invasive specimens.
High-disclosure risk jobs in the morgue include workers who develop dead bodies of people known or suspected to have had COVID-19 at the time of death; these risk groups include additional set-up controls, including isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, when the procedure for making aerosols is followed.
Special negative pressure air circulation devices may be appropriate in some health centers and morgues.
The samples should be touched under the safety measures of Biosafety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated in designated waiting areas depending on whether they are suspected COVID-19 cases. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respiratory devices for those who work within 6 feet of a known patient or suspect of SARS-CoV-2, and those who pay for aerosol-forming action.
In light of a comprehensive and written safety respiratory program in the U.S., NIOSH-approved N95 filtering devices should be used in the breath or better, including appropriate testing, training, and medical testing.
Other types of devices can provide better respiratory protection and improve the comfort of the worker. The WHO does not recommend covering completely, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and not transmitted by the body's secretions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends only surgical masks in place of the entry screen for staff.
For people who are still collecting respiratory samples, caring for or transmitting COVID-19 patients without aerosol-forming procedures, the WHO recommends surgical masks, glasses, or shields for the face, gowns, and gloves.
If the aerosol-forming procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Knowing that the global delivery of PPE is insufficient, WHO telemedicine, material barriers such as clean windows, only allowing those entering the room who are directly caring for a COVID-19 patient, the use of PPE is necessary for specific tasks, the use of the same device in the care of many patients suffering from the same disease, the use of respirators without the use of respirators, PPE without the use of masks, the monitoring and management of symptoms and PPE supply chain.

Subject: [Covid-19] Lightening weight and preparing for the future
SEND DATE/TIME: March 14, 2020, 00:24UTC
<0x3E> C<0x2B><0x2B>: not supported.
We are having a very difficult time this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is the one that has made it clear that humans are globally connected and that we have responsibilities to each other.
We have no example of such a challenge before, but we are well aware that our best response is the global empathy, cooperation, and social construction that sustains the spirit of this institution.
Feelings of friendship and attention that we've seen in all of our co-workers in email, phone calls and chats, all of this is an affirmation of how lucky we are to be working with amazing people.
I can't be more grateful and proud that you are all my compatriots.
Last week, someone asked me about my work.
He reminded me how important it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia now, and what a powerful symbol of this fragile resource that is available online for everyone.
Your work has made this possible, whether you're with sites or our co-workers who have organizations or our community is safe.
The world needs information and Wikipedia provides it, now more than ever.
This is the moment in which not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important changes from this coming week on how we work together.
Changes to our work and schedule.
As Robyn previously expressed, C-Team met last night to discuss our vision and schedule for the coming days and months.
In this conversation, we considered what would be the most appropriate response to what we are facing and how to keep the organization standing on its feet at that time.
With full intensity, we wanted to end the tension for a long time and promote our mission.
If you want to dance, do it.
All staff, contractors and workers:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week, until the order is renewed.
We're not declaring a holiday - if you can work according to normal hours, the mission can put you to use.
However, nothing can be said about the world at this time, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, buy a bargain, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not tracking your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
We don't have to say it, but we do say it.
No sickness days or PTOs required - just tell your manager and help your team re-evaluate their calendar and schedule, ensuring that all aspects of the job are met.
(If you get a positive diagnosis for COVID-19, inform Bryan within the T&C Ops, T&C can help with support and ensure that the administration pays proper attention to your situation.)
Hours of work will be paid in full.
We've said it before, and we're re-iterating our obligations to our contractors and hourly staff.
Each person will be paid according to their hours of attendance during normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people work in the world around them to change their mindset.
What we can do is incredibly rewarding, especially on days like this.
Again, this is all for your own safety.
All we have to do is talk to your manager, this will give us an idea of what to expect from you and then set things up accordingly.
No work is considered essential.
There are some things we need to continue.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and fundraising teams (among others) work hard, which may require additional support.
Let's change our focus to test recent goals with all areas and support what's important to our mission.
We all have a lot to do, we will only focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt us later.
"We don't plan to do that once the pandemic is over.
You are not expected to work extra time to meet deadlines, which is currently unrealistic.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and timelines where appropriate.
What is the Annual Plan (AIP)?
In order to shape our new reality and daily working hours expectations, we aim to create our 2020-2021 annual plan.
We want to expand our 2019-2020 plan that takes more time to create a budget that allows workers to change their work priorities, and allow their loved ones to adjust to those in need who want to work less.
This extension of time will greatly reduce the work and stress of the existing planning throughout the organization.
We will introduce our plan to the board next week and inform the delegations and teams about the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you for leading the AP team in this.
Office status, appearance and cleanliness
Last week, we heard that one of our SF-based friends could be infected with COVID-19.
However, despite much caution, we have deployed an anti-virus process in the San Francisco office to clean up all surfaces.
They used a hospital-grade disinfectant solution to clean the arms and legs of each level with the help of which we have access to the chest.
The building is using its own protocol products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be in perfect condition at this time as soon as we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared its own COVID-19 protocol with all DC office staff members and with us.
By the end of last week, our DC office had moved to a remote location in line with the San Francisco Joint Guidelines.
As some of us know living in NYC, we are also renting a place in Brooklyn.
Negotiations are still ongoing, but could be delayed.
Some of our friends are working remotely for the first time.
We know that this can be a bit of an adjustment and want to give you some advice.
Meetings can be extended to a maximum of one or two hours.
If long seats are needed, think about how to distribute them on different days.
Make the meeting clear as to each of the agendas, and send the content that needs to be read first.
By default, video is used for direct collaboration and communication with features such as Google Docs and Zoom.
Take the lead in providing support for each meeting, one should monitor the discussion for questions and follow the list of speakers and one should help take notes (or note notes with mutual support).
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to technical support.
Use your profits to pay for snacks.
Join the <0x23>Removies channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The HR operational team is considering webinar-based aeronautics guidance to support distribution across the foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of social benefits to cancel Wikimedia's privileged public events, such as the Epidemic, until the World Health Organization (WHO) announces an end to the pandemic.
They should be aware that we understand that our cancellation request and other sanctions may make it possible for them to complete their accepted cooperative activities and that there will be no penalty for modifying or slowing down these targets.
In the coming week, we will follow additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic social conferences.
The general feelings of the global community are sad about this disruption but satisfied with the clear ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia, etc.
Going forward, CRT is working on creating a web page on MetaWiki to give the community a chance to track communication with them and monitor their impact.
Stay in touch with COVID-19 related matters.
We will also invite your calendar for a special meeting next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share the most up-to-date information, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We support each other and help each other as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and other necessary information about COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep this page up-to-date and all other information in one place.
We are working to establish close contacts with staff members who are currently living in countries that are severely affected.
If you need help with travel, events, an important task, or coverage challenge, or anything else, please do not hesitate to work with CRT and get information.
We are here to help and connect.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please email Brian Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and responsibilities.
Rather, they are an opportunity, our work and responsibilities will need to shift to a form we have never seen in the past.
These are the steps that we believe are necessary to help each other so that we can continue to work, support our movement with the support it needs, and serve the world on which it depends.
When the time comes, our work will be waiting for us.
From now on, helping each other is the need of the hour and taking the time to do important work that will come in the next few weeks but possibly in the next few months.
We need all of you to do this, and that's why it's important that you take care of yourself and your family so that you're ready to be in the best possible condition when needed.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't wash your face!

B-Angiotensin-enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 reduces the amount of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing the amount of anguins (1-7) making it a reliable drug for the treatment of heart disease. ACE2 also acts as an entry point for some coronavirus cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often called HACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a type of zinc that contains metalloenzyme that is found on the surface of the endothelial and in the rest of the cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the en-terminal peptides M2 domain and a cterminal choline renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I receptor protein, which has its enzyme-activated domain on the surface of cells in the lungs and other fibers.
The domain outside the cells of ACE2 is cloned from the transmembrane domain by a second enzyme called sedatives, and the resulting solute protein is released into the bloodstream which is eventually excreted through the urine.
ACE2 is found in most of the organs: ACE2 is mainly attached to the lung type II rib cells, small intestinal intestinal intestinal tracts, arterial and virions endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells.
The effect of ACE2 mRNA is also found in the outer hemisphere of the brain, body lettering, little finger to the lower elbow, brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance to ACE.
The ACE enzymatone I hormone is synthesized in the blood vessels of angiotensin II.
In return, ACE2 separates the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from the angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and binds it to hydrolyses to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Hr-Val-Py-Py-Py).
ACE2 can also dissociate a number of other peptides including [des-org9]-bradykinin, epinephrine, neurotensin, denofin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also controls the membrane transport of SLC6A19 carrying natural amino acids and is involved in mental illness of the brain.
As a protein transmembrane, ACE2 acts as the central entry point into the cells of a few coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the restriction of fertilization to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of the cells of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 causes the contents of a single cell to be ingested and both viruses and enzymes to migrate within the cells.
The intervention process also requires the priming of the protein by the representative serine protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition continues as a potential treatment under current research. This has led some to conclude that a decrease in ACE2 levels in the cells may make it easier to cope with the disease.
However, a number of professional societies and organizations have advised against the use of common ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34 percent reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Moreover, the risk of pneumonia in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and cardiac arrest, was also reduced.
ACE inhibitors are also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related deaths, although the results were less robust than the overall risk of pneumonia."
Human transplantation ACE2 (rhACE2) is touted as a modern treatment for severe lung injury, and it appeared that it would improve the supply of hemodynamics and oxygen with symptoms of a lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and in addition to the 24-hour effect, the action begins in 30 minutes.
Numerous results suggest that rhACE2 may be a better drug for people with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where the prevalence of angiotensin II is high.
B'COVID-19 apps are mobile applications that help in communication during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, for example, the process of identifying people ("contact") who have been in contact with an infected person.
A number of such applications have been made or proposed in several areas and jurisdictions with the support of the government.
A number of applications have been developed frameworks for finding communication.
Privacy concerns were raised, especially about the system used by app users to find a geographic location.
The low-intercept alternative involves the use of Bluetooth signals to transfer the user's location to another mobile phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would collaborate to integrate Bluetooth-based applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has created an app that allows citizens to find out if they were in contact with someone infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 cities in China. The app called Trace Together is being used in Singapore.
The app was created by a local IT community, released as a free resource and will be handed over to the government. Northern Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app called "Stop Corona!" that can detect the proximity of potential victims and provide an immediate response to health authorities.
The app has been developed by the Ministry of Information and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
The government said on April 12 that the link-searching app is in the next phase of development and will be available for release within a week - with plans for similar applications in Ireland and France.
Australia and New Zealand are both considering developing applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and the Blotress protocol - Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Moscow, to ensure people don't leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, presented a number of potential practical difficulties in the app-based systems, including false positive results and a low probability of effectiveness, if the use of the application was limited to a small segment of the population.
By removing concerns about the spread of false or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple has set limits on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related applications to their App Store, limiting them to "official" or otherwise well-known organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have voiced their concerns about the endless surveillance restrictions on the coronavirus app, especially on whether surveillance arrangements designed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be removed once the threat is gone.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance arrangements.
The following companies have announced their plans for the program:
The monitoring must be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
The extension of surveillance and surveillance should be for a specific period of time:
The use of the data will be limited to the purpose of COVID-19;
Data protection and anonymity will be protected and evidence-based protection must be disclosed;
Digital surveillance should be avoided by making it more discriminatory and non-critical;
The data sharing with a third party must be made clear under the law;
Security measures must be taken against abuses, and citizens will have the right to respond to abuses;
All "related partners" will need meaningful participation, including public health experts and non-significant groups. The Germany Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and the Reporter Without Borders (Reporter Ohanian Greenzin) (RSF) also released surveillance lists.
Google/Apple's proposed plan from its operating system device, when it is not needed, aims to eliminate the monitoring mechanism and solve the problem of constant monitoring.
Some countries used a network-based Occasional Surveillance System instead of the app, which eliminates both the need to download the application and the ability to avoid surveillance.
A network-based monitoring system was approved in Israel.
Network-based solutions, including access to unauthenticated data of the Opportunity Palace, have the potential for significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems integrated with central servers require access to personal location data; a number of privacy protection systems have been developed that use only central servers for interoperability (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to track contacts.
Instead of using one of the best applications, the system collected surveillance information from a variety of sources, including surveillance data in a mobile device and the exchange of data from the card, and collected all of them to generate notices for potentially infected people via text messages.
In addition to using this information to warn of possible links, the government has made the site publicly available, something that has been allowed due to far-reaching changes to information privacy laws when the MERS epidemic broke out in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites - countries such as Germany have considered both centralized and privacy protection systems.
Details have not yet been released as of April 6, 2020.
As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth's weak energy (BLE) that required the user's chance palace to enter another mobile phone.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort consisting of both centralized and non-centralized methods, and is not a stand-alone protocol. Among the non-centralized protocols are: Uncentralised privacy protection location monitoring (DP-PPT/DP-3T), contact temporary numbers (TCN, fka event contact number, CEN), and mobile contact tracing protocols.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data does not go out of the device and is on all matching devices.
The privacy group at MIT Media Laboratory is developing secure pathways, which are a platform to use privacy protection techniques when collecting and using location or route intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on research by Cort<0xC3><0xA9>s Abyad "Apps Gone Sick: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Epidemic" released in March 2020, a second similar effort by Engma MPC, a privacy technology development company originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and contractors, without compromising on the confidentiality of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCN alliance was founded by a group of people who shared the same vision, and who had widespread cross-border protocols, to reduce fragmentation to enable surveillance and surveillance apps as a global interoperability factor that is critical to achieving mass adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had made the application, the Bluetrace application, used by its government, free of charge.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to trace contacts, which, according to their claim, would protect privacy, based on a combination of weak Bluetooth energy technology and secure encryption.
They also published the specifications of the original technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three phases:
The implementation of these protocols will enable governments to release official protection privacy applications for coronavirus detection.
Through the integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple intend to solve this persistent monitoring problem first by distributing the system through operating system updates, and later removing it in the same way when the risk is eliminated.
Changing a medicine (also known as changing the purpose of the medicine, re-profiling, changing the job or changing the treatment) is the medical condition of one drug approved for the treatment of one disease, rather than the medication used for the disease for which it was originally developed.
This is an online scientific research that is currently underway to investigate the effective and safe treatment of COVID-19.
Other directions of research include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the transfer of rosacea plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 potentiated proteins, each of which has multiple molecular sites.
The analysis of these sampling sites provides an appropriate plan to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most aggressive target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like, as RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helices, S proteins, and ADP-ribophosphate, proteins.
Hussain A.A., et al., studied a number of candidate compounds, which were then corrected and analyzed with the highest approved drugs for their conformation to the structure of the carotid artery in order to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in its pre-medical studies, suggesting it in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug used to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Organization announced that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in clinical trials.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York's official experiments on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, F.D.Dr<0xC3><0xA9> approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA in clinical trials and its EUA allows emergency use only on patients who are hospitalized but are unable to receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC has said that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of prophylaxis or SARS-CoV-2 disease" has not yet been determined.
Doctors say they use the drug when "there is no other option left".
A Turkish research group in Istanbul is conducting a short study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are ongoing at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Longon Medical School is conducting an experiment on the safety and efficacy of the precautionary use of Hydrochloroquine.
China's experiments in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that the favipiravir was "clearly" effective.
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not take this medicine.
In a study of 240 pneumonia patients in Wuhan, half were given favipiravir and half were given umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the current evidence in support of this drug is very few and early.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its stockpile, and use it through the military at university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has dominated the Trump administration over the purchase of the drug, which may be less effective in severe disease cases where the virus has already spread.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to become pregnant.
A study on lopinavir/retnavir (cletra), which is a compound of antiviral lopinavir and retnavir, has concluded that it has "not seen any benefit".
These drugs were designed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to proteins.
A group of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will be linked to the SARS-CoV-2 proteases, prompting criticism in the scientific community for shifting resources to regenerative medicine, especially for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has included lopinavir/retanavir in the international co-ordination trial.
Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Science for the prevention of Ebola virus disease and the treatment of Marburg virus disease, and the subsequent Gilead Science quickly discovered that Remdesivir has a number of antiviral activity against phytosanitary, fumio, paramexo and corona-viruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the promotion of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious disease and transmission.
Some early pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier of resistance. Several such clinical trials, including two administered by Cleveland University Hospitals; one for people with low disease and the other for people with severe disease, are included.
For serious patients with COVID-19 who are hospitalized, there are three clinical trials of vitamin C in the vein; two of satisfaction-controlling (China, Canada) and one of uncontrollable (Italian).
The state of New York began testing Azetahromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for taejin's alvesco (cyclosanide), which is a steroid-containing hormone to inhale asthma patients, to treat patients infected with the novel coronavirus who have not shown symptoms of the disease.
Angiotensin, a form of reversible enzyme 2, is a Phase II trial planned to select 200 serious patients admitted to hospitals in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called colcorona, is selecting 6,000 adults over the age of 40 who have COVID-19 and show mild symptoms but do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant or lactating women or women who do not have effective contraception are not eligible.
A number of anti-inflammatory drugs are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight liver and lung acid are widely used to treat patients, which has warned the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
On April 14, a multi-center study on 300 patients researching the use of inoxparin sodium in prophylaxis and therapeutics was announced in Italy.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, all scientific attention has been focused on remaking approved antiviral drugs, such as those developed on the outbreak of the first emerging MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
ribavirin: According to China's 7th edition guidelines, ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19.
U Mifenovir: According to China's 7th edition guidelines, ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19.
Some of the antibiotics that were potentially reusable to treat COVID-19 are:
Tocilizumab (NTIL-6 Recipient): Approved by China.
Also trials in Italy and China. And see Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19
The B.A. COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it does not expect a vaccine from the SARS-CoV-2 origin, which is why a vaccine for the virus will be available in less than 18 months.
As of April, five vaccine candidates are in Phase I safety study.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, a major pandemic hit the world, which led to a lot of investment and research activities in the development of a vaccine.
Many companies are using advertised loony substances to develop a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was said that the CEP's essential steps to develop a vaccine were fast, the capacity of the manufacturers, deployment scale and global reach.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were in research and development in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Phase I safety studies include a number of major platform goals:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I manufacturers and vaccine candidates: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vectors (Phase I manufacturers and vaccine candidates: Ear Sinobiologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of vaccine development, 78 are confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Melkon Institute), and 37 others announced but very little public information is available about them (thought they are in the planning stage or are being designed now).
Phase I-II trials are early safety and efficacy checks, usually without sequence, drug-free female-controlled, and occur at multiple sites, while determining more accurate, effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and the effectiveness of vaccine testing for disease prevention, while monitoring the side effects at the highest dose.
Of 79 vaccine candidates in active preparation (still certified as of early April 2020), 74 had not yet been diagnosed on humans (yet in "premature" research).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would enhance an immune response by genetically modifying viral proteins.
On January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on the vaccine, with the aim of starting human trials in 2021.

On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had finalized the composition of the vaccine and were starting trials.
On February 27, 2020, No Generics Immuno Oncology, a subsidiary of Generics, announced that they were launching a plan to develop a Li-Ke peptide vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19.
They want to develop a vaccine candidate that will be tested on humans within 90 days.
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the Army Medical Research and Material Command in Fort Detrick, United States, and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both located in western Maryland, announced that they were working on the development of a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that they had teamed up with Navix.
on the development and production of a vaccine.
These partners further announced plans for pre-medical experiments and a Phase I trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working with 11 isolated individuals and that too with a speed that would take at least one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like virus in partial collaboration with the Canadian Health Research Institute.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research and is expected to be tested on humans by July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered Carey Rake "large sums" of money for special access to a COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government had protested against.
On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to develop a vaccine on a joint mRNA basis.
The candidate BNT162 of the mRNA-based vaccine is currently in pre-clinical trials, with clinical trials expected to begin by April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian company, announced that it would conduct pre-clinical trials by April 2020 and that its final candidate for the vaccine would begin human trials by the end of the month.
On 19 March 2020 in France, the Coalition for Epidemiology Innovation Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in the COVID-19 Vaccine Research Consortium comprising Institute Pasteur, Themes Biosciences (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, with CEPI's total investment in the development of COVID-19 vaccines reaching US$29 million.
Other CEPI partners in the development of COVID-19 vaccines include Moderna, Corey Walk, Innova, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing a variety of vaccine candidates on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020, that they were developing a self-developed RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days of the candidate receiving the order from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million in Canadian funding for 96 research projects on counter-medical issues related to COVID-19, including a number of vaccine candidates in the initiatives of Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced a special Canadian$192 million for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, with several new vaccines planned for the establishment of a national "vaccine bank" that will be used when a second outbreak of the coronavirus breaks out.
On April 2, 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh's Peter's Bridge School of Medicine reported experiments on Petkovic, a potential COVID-19 virus in mice, saying that "MNA showed a strong antibody response to antigen-related antibodies via the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine [in mice] that was clearly manifested 2 weeks after the vaccine was administered."
On April 16, 2020, in Canada, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate harmless virus-like particles inside human bacteria, which strengthens the immune system of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities mobilized resources to access IBM's supercomputers, which will be pooled with Hewlett-Packard Enterprises, Amazon, Microsoft and Google's cloud computing resources.
Some vaccines have different effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other benefits besides the disease they want to avoid.
A further 4,170 medical staff are being enrolled for another randomised trial in Australia.
It is possible that the vaccine will not be safe or effective in the preparation stages.
Preliminary research to test vaccine efficacy using COVID-19-specific animal samples, such as ACE2-binary mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, identified the need for biosafety level 3 preventive measures to directly combat the virus, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested in inhumane animal models.
As of 2020, there is no vaccine or treatment for SARS that is safe and effective in humans.
According to a research paper published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and preparation of novel vaccines and medicines for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public institutions around the world.
When MERS was first discovered, it was thought that the current SARS research would be a useful model in the treatment and vaccine development of MERS-CoV disease.
As of March 2020, one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) was the one that had completed Phase I clinical trials on humans and the other three are ongoing, with all vector-containing viral vaccines, two adenoviral vector-containing vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-containing vaccine.
Social media posts have fueled a conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 virus is known and that a vaccine is already available.
Various social media posts have pointed to the existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines and other trees of coronaviruses, such as the SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include shortness of breath, back pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
It usually takes five days from the appearance to the onset of symptoms, but can last from two to fourteen days.
Although the symptoms of the disease are often mild, some go as far as viral pneumonia and organ failure.
As on 17th April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported from 210 affected areas, resulting in 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered - mainly from close contact with the public, often in the form of small droplets from the mouth when coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although similar droplets come out when exhaling, they often fall to the ground or floor, instead of being able to spread the disease from long distances.
After touching the affected surface, people can also suffer from this disease by touching their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands.
The virus can live on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is the most contagious disease within three days of the onset of symptoms, although it is possible to spread both before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease.
The use of masks is recommended for people who are suspected of being infected with the virus and people with health conditions.
The proposal to wear a mask for the general public is controversial, some officials are against its use, some recommend its use, and some are calling it necessary.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all regions of the World Health Organization.
People infected with the virus may not show symptoms or have symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, mental confusion, difficulty waking up, and blueness of the face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present.
Symptoms of illness such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat can also be seen on the upper part of the respiratory tract.
Symptoms of gastrointestinal diseases such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in different percentages.
In the beginning, there were only a few cases in China with chest tightness and bloating.
In some cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to four days, but it can also be two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who show symptoms of the disease will do so within 11.5 days of being infected.
These affected people without symptoms are not yet fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they may be carriers.
The proportion of people infected with the disease is currently unknown and is being studied, where the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases during hospital stays were asymptomatic.
China's National Health Commission began counting asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; of the 166 infected patients on that day, 130 (78%) remained undiagnosed at the time of testing.
There may be a higher amount of viral load in both Tahuk and Bulgaria.
Talking in a high-pitched voice produces more droplets than normal speech.
In a study in Singapore, it was found that the droplets of Dahanpe Kahassi have the ability to go up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioresol transmission may be possible and that samples of viral RNA have been found to be positive in air collectors in the hallways outside people's rooms.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can aerosolize the respiratory tract and result in airborne transmission.
The virus is most contagious when symptoms appear in people; and if the virus spreads before symptoms appear, the risk is less.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that now that it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three people.
In particular, the virus was found to be effective on cardboard for one day, on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for three days, and on 99% copper for four hours.
However, it varies in terms of humidity and temperature.
If soaps and detergents are used correctly, they are effective; soap products make the thickened protective layer of the virus inactive, as well as purifying the virus from skin and other surfaces.
Other formulations, Heisey benzconium chloride and chlorohezidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken in an average of two days of hospitalization.
Of the six patients, five saw the highest viral load in the first sample, and the sixth saw the highest viral load in the second day of testing.
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel acute respiratory disease coronavirus, first detected in three people in Wuhan who had pneumonia with acute respiratory illnesses.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the respective coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which tore its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the original SARS-CoV.
The first are the organs that are most affected by COVID-19 because the virus gets access to these host cells through the enzyme-altering enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found to be the most abundant in the host cells of the first type II type of mammalian cell.
To bind to the virus ACE2 uses a special level of sugar called "cell" (piplomer), and enters the host cell.
In Wuhan, China, 12% of those hospitalized were found to have a severe heart injury and are frequently found in severe disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is higher due to diseases of the immune system during inflammation and disease progression throughout the body, but severe heart muscle injury may also be related to ACE2 inhibitors.
2ACE is more visible in the heart and they are involved in the function of the heart.
Patients of the intensive care unit affected by COVID-19 saw higher cases of blood clotting (31%) and thrombophlebitis (25%) in the vein and may be related to poor diagnosis.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has ACE2 inhibitors for the appearance of nerve cells of the respiratory tract, severe COVID-19-infected patients have more inflammatory symptoms than usual affecting the body.
In particular, sick SM-CSF secreting T-cells were found to be associated with the formation of inflammatory IL-6 single-celled and severe lung pathologies in patients with COVID-19.
There were also reports of long-term cell interference during the post-mortem.
The WHO has published several methods of disease testing.
The standard method of experiments is time-reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on respiratory samples obtained from the nasal swab; however, nasal swabs or saliva samples may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can be used, but it requires two samples to be taken in two weeks and the results are less important immediately.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a variant of coronavirus and published a genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the infectious disease caused by viruses.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which detect active infectious disease and whether or not a person has been infected in the past) were in the development stage, but are not yet widely used.
The Chinese experience of testing only showed an accuracy of 60% to 70%.
The FDA approved the first end-of-the-month care trial center for use in the United States on March 21, 2020.The Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University issued diagnostic guidelines for the detection of the epidemic, taking into account medical characteristics and the risk of epidemics.
In early infectious disease, double-sided multiplexing, surrounded by ground glass optics, inappropriate and later dissociated blur is common.
As the disease progresses, it may appear full-dome, crucifix plunging (the thickness of the beige veil varies with age), and stability.
Some statistics are available about microbes and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the post-mortem are:
Macroscopy: Inflammation of the membrane of the lungs, inflammation of the heart, stability of the lungs and swelling of the lungs.
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Mild Pneumonia: A swelling of the lungs, an excess of pneumocytes, large abnormal pneumocytes, larynx inflammation with infiltration of lymphocytes, and the formation of multicellular giant cells.
Severe Pneumonia: Low loss of appetite (DAD) with low sweating.
Dread is the manifestation of the symptoms of severe respiratory distress (ARD) and the severe lack of oxygen in the body.
Pneumonia Resilience: Organization of the external ovaries in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary vasculitis
Blood: clotted blood flow (DIC) in the veins; white and red blood response.
Precautions to reduce the risk of illness include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water, and washing for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing, and using the inside of the elbow if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends the use of cloth to cover the mouth in a crowd, to limit the spread of the virus from people who show no symptoms.The social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing contact with a large group of affected people by closing schools and offices, imposing travel restrictions and canceling large public gatherings.
Social distancing guidelines also include keeping a distance of at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) between people.
Since a vaccine is not expected before 2021, one of the key points of tackling COVID-19 is to reduce the highest levels of the epidemic, called "flattering give."
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are dirty, before eating and after cleaning, coughing or sneezing.
It further suggests that at least 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizers should be used, but only if soap and water are not readily available in areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available.
In these formations, antimicrobial activity, is produced by ethanol and esopropanol.
Alcohol uses hydrogen peroxide to help eliminate bacteria's spores; it is "not an active substance for fungal germs in the hands."
Glycerol is poured as a liquid.
People have been organized with supportive care, including fluid treatment, oxygen support, and support for other important affected organs.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of being infected with the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracellular Membrane Oxygen (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory obstruction, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and improved diet have been suggested to improve immunity.
Assistive therapy may be used in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of the epidemic, with recommendations published by the WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission for the care of those hospitalized with COVID-19.
Psychiatrists and lung doctors in the United States have compiled treatment suggestions from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical experts recommend paracetamol(mystaminophane) as an important drug to replace ibuprofen.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of spreading the virus, especially in a medical environment where there is a medical procedure that produces a fever, such as an enteric tube or hand inhalation.
For medical staff caring for people infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends general precautions, contact precautions, and precautions for airborne germs, as well as keeping the person in an airborne infection room (AIIR).
The recommended equipment is: PPE gowns, respirators or face masks, eye guards, and medical gloves. Respiratory equipment is preferred (instead of face masks) when available.
The N95 respirator has been approved for industrial use, but the FDA has allowed the mask to be used only under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but they do not guarantee the effect of use against a particular unapproved biological agent.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or homemade masks as a last resort.
People infected with COVID-19 are often not so bad that they need mechanical evacuation or replacements, but a few percent of patients need them.
The type of respiratory support in people hospitalized with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied, with some evidence that high-flow nasal cannula or duodenal duct with positive airway pressure can be avoided.
It is not known whether either of the two gives the same benefit to severely ill people.
Some doctors prefer invasive macular degeneration when available because this procedure limits the spread of airborne particles compared to high flow nasal cannula. Severe disease is more common in older adults (in those who are older than 60 and especially in those who are older than 80).
In developed countries, there is no sufficient number of beds per person, which limits the ability of the health system to handle an increase in people infected with COVID-19 who must be hospitalized.
According to one study, 5% in China were admitted to the intensive care unit, 2.3% required mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% of deaths occurred.
In China, 30% of people infected with COVID-19 are finally admitted to the intensive care unit.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) increases in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
The pressure-controlled mode and high PEEP-capable ventilators need to maximize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of damage to the ventilator-related lungs and air tightness in the chest.
There will be no more PPE available on older ventilators.
Research for a possible treatment began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in the clinical trial stage.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although it may take until 2021 to develop new drugs, several of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in the advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral drugs may be tested in people with severe disease.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that volunteers participate in the effectiveness and safety experiences of potential treatments.The FDA allows the use of artificially-recovered people's plasma experimentally if a person's life is at serious or immediate risk.
It has not gone through medical studies to prove itself safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to prevent the spread of the disease.
The user will be asked to enter his/her name and identification number.
The app can address "close contacts" using surveillance data and therefore indicate a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also view the status of three other users.
The app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also warns local medical officials to use mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, tracking mobile phones, and big data analytics on artificial intelligence to find victims and those who have come in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track mobile phone data of people who should have had the coronavirus.
The measure was taken to protect the people who could be in contact with the infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the collected data on mobile phone space with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to conduct research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breakers.
The Italian regional health administrator said he had been informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are still roaming."
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend with 42,000 candidates.
Estonia's President Christie Kajulyde also called for a creative solution to the spread of the coronavirus.
Individual people may have difficulties due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side-effects of treatment or fear of the pandemic itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "More social distancing, isolation, a sense of well-being, stress and economic downturn are devastating to people's mental health and well-being."
The disease can take a mild turn with little or no symptoms, which is similar to other common respiratory diseases such as a common fever.
Usually, patients recover within two weeks, while patients with severe or serious diseases recover in three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may also be at greater risk from COVID-19 based on data from other viruses such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is not available.
In severely affected individuals, COVID-19 can rapidly turn into acute respiratory disease (ARDS) that can lead to respiratory failure, body mold, or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include body mold, abnormal clotting of blood, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Abnormal blood clotting, especially in 6% of patients with COVID-19, was found to increase the duration of blood clotting, while the normal functioning of the kidneys was observed in 4% of patients in this group.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 showed higher levels of liver enzymes (tranaemics).
According to the same document, the time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, of which five days were spent in the hospital.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
In one study of early patients, the median duration from the appearance of early symptoms to death was 14 days, while the full range was six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8%, while the mortality rate among women was 1.7%.
A post-mortem examination of the lungs showed the damage to the air in the lungs spread along the veins of the cactus fibromyalgia in the small oils for the presence of air.
Changes related to the disease of the living virus cell have been seen in pneumocysts.
The picture of the lungs is similar to the symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDC).
According to China's National Health Commission, 11.8 deaths were observed due to elevated troponin or heart levels.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's March figures, 89% of hospitalized patients already had some disease, and the availability of medical resources and the region's socioeconomics could also affect mortality rates.
Estimates of mortality vary due to regional variations, but this may also be due to difficulties in the procedure.
Low number of patients can lead to increased mortality.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of pre-existing diseases means that the current mortality rate is low.
The prevalence of severe symptoms of COVID-19 among smokers was 1.4 times higher and the need for intensive care or mortality rate was 2.4 times higher than among non-smokers.
The Hong Kong hospital administration found a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung examinations indicated organ damage.
This can lead to the appearance of extreme care symptoms after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known if it contained long-term immunity in recovered individuals from past pandemics.
Immunity is likely to be seen based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but there have also been reported cases where the coronavirus has returned positive results after recovering from COVID-19.
These cases are thought to be getting worse due to long-term infectious disease rather than re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and originated as an animal-infected disease.
The exact source is not known, but as of December 2019, the spread of the pandemic was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in Lancet in January 2020, shows that the first case of symptoms appeared on December 1, 2019.
The WHO's official publications reported December 8, 2019, being the first date of the onset of the disease.
A number of steps are usually taken to determine the cause of death.
These numbers vary from region to region and over time, and can be influenced by the number of tests performed, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the outbreak began, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health factors.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-related deaths to emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 and clinical or epidemiological deaths from COVID-19 to U07.2 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-related deaths.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death toll and case ratio as of 17 April 2020 is 6.9 (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include Mortality Rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of deaths among confirmed cases, and Epidemic Mortality Rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of deaths among infected persons (verified and unverified).
These statistics do not cover a particular time period and cover a specific population from the disease to the solution of the case.
Although antibodies do not appear in all infected people, the presence of antibodies can provide information on how many people have been infected.
In Italy, a small village of 4,600 people at the epicenter of the epidemic, Castglio de Ada, 80 (1.7%) of which have already died.
In Gangolt, the disease spread due to Catholic Christian festivals, and spread to younger people, causing a relatively low mortality rate, and not necessarily all deaths from COVID-19 have been classified as such.
Moreover, Germany's health system has not been vanquished.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of patients may have antibodies, as estimated from blood donors.
69 persons (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died of COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic on men and women is different.
Mortality rates are higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is after the age of 50, while the difference between men and women ends at just 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact cause of this gender difference is not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be one of the reasons.
Immunological variations based on gender, low use of tobacco in women and men, and the emergence of other diseases in men than women, such as high blood pressure at a young age, can lead to an increase in mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people were male and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not been able to locate data on the gender of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in a variety of ways.
A high percentage of medical staff, especially nurses, are women, and are at higher risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name for the disease would be "COVID-19."
WHO President Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to the days when the first case appeared: December 31, 2019.
The name has been chosen to avoid referring to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal type, or group of people, taking into account international recommendations to prevent stigma.The virus that causes COVID-19 is known as coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO additionally uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public correspondence.
Both disease and varices are commonly referred to as "coronaviruses."
During the early outbreak of the epidemic in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan virus."
In January 2020, the WHO recommended nCoV-2019 and nCoV-2019 as the interim names for the virus and disease, in a 2015 directive against using the place name in the name of the disease and the virus.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to the capacity limitations of the standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are using medical equipment such as nasal swabs and ventilators.
In one instance, when an Italian hospital was in need of a ventilator valve, and the seller was not able to provide it in the required time, a local craftsman copied it and made the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misconceptions about the onset, duration, prevention, treatment, and other precursors of the disease emerged and quickly spread over the Internet.
Humans can spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral growth in pigs, ducks and chickens.
There is no cure or cure for the disease.
Research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched "integrative experiments" to assess treatment effects from four of the most effective existing antiviral compounds.
There is no vaccine available, but various agencies are actively developing candidates for the vaccine.
Previous research on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the same means to enter the ACE2 human genome.
Three vaccines are currently being tested.
First, the researchers aim to develop a vaccine for the entire virus.
The use of a virus, whether inactivated or dead, builds an immediate immune response in the human body against the new COVID-19 disease.
Another strategy, the sub-component vaccine, aims to develop a vaccine that will sensitize the immune system against certain sub-components of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the center of such research is the S spike protein, which helps the virus enter the enzyme ACE2.
The third strategy is nuclear acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, the novel way of producing vaccines).
The vaccine will be tested for safety and efficacy - the first clinical trial of the vaccine began on March 16, 2020, on four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine is based on a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.The development of the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 suggested a potential challenge to those who rely on the antibody, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials are testing the drug, which is already an approved treatment for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The majority of Chinese research consists of re-recommended antiviral drugs, with reports of nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review for candidates for the development and use of COVID-19 vaccines had been in progress. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being tested, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/retinovir and lopinavir/retinovir of interferon.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence of efficacy from Remdesivir.
Medical improvements were seen in patients treated with low use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China, and Italy, where chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, we are still waiting for the results of the research.
The medical administration of Korea and China suggested the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending one gram of a daily dose, warns that double doses of the drug can be extremely dangerous and deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency permit for doctors who are engaged in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, at their discretion, to use hydrochloroquine and chloroquine.
Preliminary data suggest that higher amounts of robavirin are necessary to prevent SARS-CoV-2 within the organism.
Nitazoxanide has been suggested for further vivo studies after demonstrating a low concentration in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that ACE2 is necessary for entry into SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the receptor.
Chloroquine and hydroxy chloroquine have major inhibitions in studies with or without azithromycin that have prevented the medical community from accepting the treatment without further study. Oxytocin does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokines may be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxy chloroquine is a characteristic of the anti-cytokinin strom, after a brief study was completed, Tocilizumab was included in treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China.
Italy is undergoing a phase 2 randomized test at the national level after positive results appeared in people with severe illness.
The combined serum ferritin blood test is aimed at identifying the causative agent strom, which is thought to cause death in some infected people.
In 2017 for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release disease for a different cause i.e. CART cell treatment, the FDA had approved Masantrolvacin 6 receptor rival based on past-style studies
To date, there is no random, conclusive evidence that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment against CRS.
The clean and concentrated antibodies, produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19, are being researched as passive immunization of an inactivated vaccine for those who need it.
This strategy was tested for SARS with unintended consequences.
Viral neutralization is one of the anticipated mechanisms by which inactivated antibody treatments can be used to defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other procedures, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of non-functional antibody treatment, for example, the use of a friendly monoclonal antibody, are in progress.
The production of rubella, which is a liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and consists of specific antibodies to the virus, can be developed to be used quickly.
Coronavirus Diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wen Ling, a doctor at Wuhan's central hospital, was infected and died due to COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
