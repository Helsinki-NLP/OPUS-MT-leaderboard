It is today the production of water, while the other important aspect to consider is the proportion of digital camera images created by the sensor structure.
The actual structure of 35 millimetres is 36 millimetres in width and 24 millimetres in height.
The proportion of this structure (to get the ratio of all simple whole numbers by external division) is as follows 3:2.
Common structures (e.g. APS structure families) are close to or equal to this size ratio.

Traffic flow is the study of the interaction between the individual driver and the means of transport at two points of intersection and between them.
The behavior of the driver cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty, which unfortunately leads to traffic flow studies.
Fortunately, drivers have been able to find the right way to deal with eutectic behavior; in fact, some of the traffic streamrooms have practical stability and can be mathematically represented as smoother.
For better representation of traffic flow, the relationship between the three main characteristics is (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
