Welsh's RAM (constitutional member) is concerned with images like 'Mat'
Some members of the conference disagree with this suggestion that their status should be changed by the title of the MWP (sharves of Welsh) to change the title of their status.
It's because the case has been planned to change the name of the council and restore Welsh.
All the fats connected to politics are concerned that it can be fun.
One LaberAM said, "Don't join this Twap and Pwp" was concerned about his group."
For readers who stay out of Wales: in Wells, twp means stupid and pwp.
One player said the whole group was "not good" and he suggested other options.
A political party of Welsh said that his group was a "superator" of the name, but he noted that the word could have been completely changed in words, and the MWP could have been broken.
In this context, the letter is properly rendered as well as the letter of ww in the English language.
In the case of changes in the name, the current council of the Council, said: "What are the members of the council called "what is called "what is called the final judge" in the matter of the case, the final decision will be to the members of the members of the council."
According to the Wells government Act 2017, the Welsh Council has the right to change its name.
In June, Ayoeg spoke about the proposals of public advice that were much more supported to name the council than to address Volksuish.
In the case of the RAM caption, Ayoga supported Welsh's breath or WMP, but found the most support options in public advice.
Of course, MAM is suggesting several other options, but the backends are very hard to get a general agreement for Alan Jones, hoping they will present a legal draft for change within a few weeks.
The laws designed for changes will also include other changes in the proceedings, including the rules and committees for the failure of the RAM.
When arguing on the law building, AM will find the final vote on the question of what they should be called.

In the past two years, I have been advised to keep quiet and not to speak up."
But, I didn't come into politics for it.
32 years ago, when I was connected to a school student as a student, I was asked to leave my school class completely, I was told, I wanted to give people the best public services they need - whether he is a locally a minister or a minister.
I never hid any of my politics in the last election.
There is no one who has a doubt about my policy and my present leadership is in trouble.
I would like to tell all those who encouraged the Friday proposal that when the country's homes, business and public services are increasing, I don't know how to waste my time and energy in showing my loyalty to the Leber Party.
But in fact, I have a message that isn't for the natemumum, it's for my supporters, whether they're in the lab or not: I'm proud that I'm serving you, and I promise that I can't prevent any stranger or political activity in my work.

Finally, their defaces was fine, and they found the best opportunity they could have, which gave them the opportunity to make the house available and to be happy with Peter.
He said, "We're fully tested in our games and we're still disappointed, so I'm happy."
Robin Christes of Melroas said: "This is credited to the Air as much as possible."
The efforts at Grand Anderson’s 14th minute of the 14th day of the Grand Anderson came to the front of the Iron Age, but the scorer of Scotland's players was given these cards, which had the chance to make a score, and Jason Bengan made a very difficult effort.

But Mezos was better in the second hand and the best efforts of Patrick Anderson's efforts to go to Googet, which reduced the five-points of Leve.
Later, Rudysha Nat was severely injured, and for a long time, he had to stop the game, and then Arr sought through Stford Macdol, which changed his way through the game.
At that time, the captain of the Air team got the Yellowford MacFerson, and after much pressure on the game, Meros gave an effort to put an end to the game.

'Our authority is on the sea: Earth-based Bolivia is expected to open the way for the Court's Pacific again.'
The military-in-law La La Paz's National Hedwart has been involved in a large number of riots.
Ossian-blu flag is being shot at government buildings.
From Lake Titica to Amazan, it's a horrible thing: "We have authority on the sea.
It's our duty to re-read it."
In the 19th century, the coastal region of Bolivia, which lost the land in the fierce conflict of the land, still has a desire to find its land - they still want to shed their address again in the Pacific Ocean.
Now they hope to find the land of their native tongue back decades ago, because it's been waiting for October 1, after the discussion of the International Court's justice.
Bolivia's Department Corro Catalgia said: "There's a lot of enthusiasm in Bolivia, there's a feeling of unity and peace, and the hope of the people here will be a positive surprise."
Many Bolivian people will see the big decision of the ICz decision across the country on the big screen of the country, hoping it will be held in Bolivia’s court - which has been forced to return to the sea for decades through the discussion - to make it return to the sea.
Bolivia’s best president, Ivo Morales - who is going to face a controversial movement in the Evo Morales for the next year - also has a positive impact on the way to the Monday’s runway.
Last August he said, "We're too close to get back to the Pacific Ocean."
However, some analysts believe the court's decision would not be in the best interests of speaking - and if the decision comes to its interests, there will be plenty.
The unit currently in the Netherlands does not have the authority to publish the Chinese province, and he has decided that the possible secrets of speaking will not be specified.
In the International Court of Chile, Paze Zeit stated that the decision of the ICJ is to come six months after the final announcement, which indicates that the case was not a "act".
Besides, different from the terms of Bolivia, it seems to have been in the past four years that it could come back to the old state.
Jattt said, "The point of reaching the sea is blocked by the current government of Bolivia."
They suggested that the controversial statement of Morales has ended the reputation of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk on some conditions, but this time it will be hard to communicate after the decision.
Since 1962 the ambassadors of both countries have not lived in one country.
The former president of the Bolivian representatives of the present Bolivian government, Eduardo Rodríguez Watz Vultz, denied that the court's decision was unusually fast.
He said that Monday would have a chance to Bolivia to open up the way to new relationships with Chile, and it would have to be the opportunity to end the 13-year-old conflict.
Casillalas, who is still one of the most famous presidents in Latin America - was political over sea problems.
He said, "Bolivia will never step back to the Pacific Ocean to his authority."
"Fasla has the opportunity to know what we needed to do in the past."
North Korea says nuclear surveillance will not stop unless it is trusted in America.
Ry Young, a foreign minister of North Korea, says that their nation will not destroy their nuclear bomb unless Washington is trusted.
On Saturday, Ri gave a talk at the United Nations General Assembly.
He told the United States that he would fulfill the promises made during the high conference in Singapore between the leaders of other countries.
He commented that the American Secretary of State Mic Pempano felt that they were going to re-register nuclear Kati after more than three months of the promises made in Chim Jung in Singapore in North Korea.
Rei said that it is a "Pip Dim" that allows bans and U.S. attacks to end the Korean War.
It is also a warning to be cautious of the presoccupation campaign that is already running without the announcement of Washington Pongong.
Kim and the American President Donad Tromp wish that there was another serious conference.
However, it is entirely suspicious that the Pyongang nuclear bomb is serious to end the surveillance of the nuclear bomb because they do not want to risk the security of the country.
Kim-Trump is planning to prepare for the next month to prepare for the second high assembly.

Bert Orange Rafia, who had been trained with Rafia Rafia Fing and was put in the White Leeds handle, this was the most attractive attraction of the Paris fashions in the Paris fashion.
The famous chairman of the campaign said to FIL: 'I hope that the summer will soon come to FIL and the big-grand-back store will soon come to the store - because the designers have so impressed that it would be difficult to ignore the design of the big bicycles.'
John Edwards: Language skills are needed for citizens of outside countries
Schools of Private Education in Scotland have been watching the track record, and since 2018 it has continued to provide excellent testaries, art, music, and other cultural efforts.
More than 30,000 students in Scotland are connected to the Scotty Council of India, trying to give their students and fellow students the best.
Private schools have to prepare their students for a better and higher education, their chosen careers and their places are taking advantage of foreign citizens.
As an organization director, who can create and apply the school course, we see that modern languages continue to choose as popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in the language that he understands, you become better for him.
If you were to speak in your own language, you would be better able to understand the meaning of the words.
When we want to make a relationship and trust in people from other countries, we feel that we can trust English more.
In recent years, we can see that the language is the top top of the languages in private schools at the top of the list table.
Among them are 68 percent of students who have received the highest grade A in foreign languages.
The data collected by the students of the SCIS can be seen in the data collected by 72 percent of students in the Gaurav language, while 72 percent of the students in the German language, 69 percent in French and 63 percent of the students received a French language grade A.
This shows that schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages in which children and young people are being given the necessary skills they need in the future.
Languages are now being added as an alternative subject, including the SISTM topics (such as education, engineering, and math) of personal schools.
In 2014, according to a survey published by the U.S. Commission for Education and Sculptures in 2014, netizens fought enough to set up workers on the following positions, 17 percent expected a lack of language skills.
Thus, young people are being more than a language skills to prepare for their future career.
In addition to the most possible daily opportunities in the language, these skills are necessary to work anywhere in the world.
Whatever the choice for a career, if people have learned another language, such skills will benefit them in the future.
If you are able to speak directly to the foreigners, you will come forward to the contest.
In 2013 more than 4,000 adults in Britain participated in the YouTube survey, according to that 75 percent of people could not speak enough in a foreign language, and only 15 percent of French people were able to speak and speak only 15 percent of the languages that were spoken and reached by two-year-old percent.
That's why children today need to learn language.
In many languages, especially the languages of the developing economy, children can have a better chance of finding the right way to find the right daily.
Every school in Scotland will have different languages.
There are too many schools that will focus on high school models, while other schools will teach the languages that have the view of 2020 and the most important value for Ukraine, for example, it's physical or Japanese.
Even if your child’s interest in any language is not interested in learning any language, they will always choose the language in private schools and find it among the experts of the area.
Private Schools in Scotland are dedicated to provide a education environment that will prepare children for the future and provide them with the necessary skills to succeed in the future.
The global business environment cannot be eaten right now, so it should be a better place to learn languages in the country for the future.
In fact, modern languages must indeed be accepted as “international communications skills.”
The choice of young people in Scotland to choose this option, variety and quality will continue through personal schools.
Il Fite in the field.

North Korea said 'No Way' would have been the only party that can't be trusted.
The foreign minister of North Korea reported that the United Nations has issued the ban on the restrictions that depend on their lack of faith in the United States, and there is no way to show that the country only let the nuclear bomb out of its own way.

He said, "But, we have no answers from the United States."
"There will be no confidence in our national security without trusting in US.
While Rie repeated that the complaints made by North Korea are about the "funded" perspective of Washington's "communication" view, which will gradually take advantage of North Korea, their statement is clear from the fact that this alone cannot be abandoned by one side because it has not been left by one side.
The first time, on June 12, at the St.S. President and North Korea's Supreme Assembly, Ray announced the statement that Kim and Donal Tromp, which was referred to as "unemployment of Korea's Republic" in the first place, while the trip took place to North Korea.

Washington has also opposed the call to end strict international restrictions on North Korea.
"US.S. has first stressed the ban and has raised the level of restrictions so that he can fully achieve his purpose and, as well as, "The declaration of the war is the end of the war."
"The ban can bend us, such as a pipe device of those who are ignoring us."
But it's the point that constant pressure keeps us from getting less trust.
Ri didn't discuss the other high conference plans between Kim and Tramp, he said that U.S. leader had been reporting the quality of the last week of the United Nations.
Instead, the minister discussed the three meetings between Kim and South Korea in the past five months, saying, "If there is party South Korea and U.S. for this problem, then there will not be such an unsatisfactory movement."
Nevertheless, Rie's talk was very different from the last year's speech, when he said about the UN.N. National Action, "M. EVCT Man" on the Socidant mission, with the U.S. President of North Korea after the war.

However, we believe that they should have information about the effects of smoking.
He still has the culture of feeling proud of ‘the last night’, increasing pressure on modern technology and students means that they have to reduce gold that has become a growing problem.
Whether you sleep enough or not, it is sure that the students’s ‘ secret weapon’ can cope with stress, stress, and anxiety, he said that it also saves from the effects of the weight, because their brain constantly thinks about hunger.

He told them that because of the course they were awake and moved to Camps-World Course.

Bernhard van: WW1 Victoria Cross Cleric Sanskrit
During World War I, Victoria Cross was celebrated in her home for 100 years as a warrior of the Church of England.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernhard von won the award in the attack at Belgalez and Lehcourt on September 29, 1918.
However, they were killed by a sniper four days later, and they never knew that they had won the greatest British military honor.
On Saturday, the memorial stone was uncovered by their two grandsons in the Rashidan of the Northamptons, which was sealed by their two grandsons.
One of their ancestors, Michael Vane, said it was "proclaiming" that their grandfather's award was being abused after 100 years of victory.
According to London Gage, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Wayne led "in the middle of Canal de St-Quentin, under heavy bullets and machines in the war field."
Later they moved toward the Fireing Line and with the "Borning of the Wind", the army leader was captured by three branches before taking possession of the field-crazier and the three.
The Lieutenant Colonel van vane, just a month before the end of the war on October 4, 1918, was killed by a German sniper.
72-year-old Michael Wayne said that there were some things that I know I can't compare to, but we've got nothing to do with them."
He and his brother, Dr. James Wayne, also offered the property after the return, which led to the British Imperial War.
Michael Wayne said, "They feel highly honored to carry the role in the pay," and he said, "a real hero is being shown by support from the people."
MMA’s fanico was awake all night to see 206, but instead they found Papppapapa pags.
Imagine, you've been living all night to see Bellaster 206, but the main program is getting tired.
San Jose's Bill had 13 sides, including six on the main card and the U.K. channel for the whole night on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, as Gugard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, and in the U.C., the audience turned to a pimppapa in the puppy of overrange.
Some were very disappointed after staying awake in the morning, especially after the morning of the morning.
On Twitter, a fan described the change of children's cartoons as “a kind of sick joke.”
When asked about the spread, the governor's superior vice president, David Schwarz, said, "This material was not useful for six o'clock in the morning, so they had to switch to the program of children."
"Papi de Pig." Yes."
The Bellatter company's president Scott said they're going to work on their schedule to join the U.K. audience in the future.
"When I think about the release, I think that we might find the solution," the paper said.
"But there will be six o'clock in the morning and we will not be able to work on it until Monday, Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when this change changed, a lot of text was being heard and they were not all appropriate.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen the next time.
We'll limit it to five sides-- as we usually do-- and when we tried to do something more for the speakers, it'd get worse.
This is a bad situation."
zat Island Disk: Tom dellie felt 'uni' in case of the case.
The Olympic Goatcher Tom Delley says that he was attracted by the feelings of his case - but it motivated him to succeed.
She said, "I don't know what to do until I have reached my age."
Speaking on 4 radio debut Island disk before the Lorainnin, he said he talked about gay rights to others.
He also said that when he became a father, he had little concern about winning the Olympic victory.
Karsti Young, a regular representative of the long-term show, has taken months to vacation because of illness.
As a social-owned man in the first program, Daniel said he felt "I" in comparison with everyone because "the boy and the girls didn't personally accept the choice."
He said, "Today, I feel inferior to others, and I feel the real things that have given me the strength and the strength to succeed."
He also wanted to prove that he was “good” so that he didn’t let everyone feel disappointed when they finally knew about his case.
Two times the Olympic flag winner has become the top-prophal LGBT publishers and used his presence in this year's National Council games to reduce homosexuality from more countries.
He said he was open because he felt lucky when he was able to live without a problem and he wanted to give others the "ummed".
Three times the world champion said that a man - American filmmaker Destin Las Black, who loved him in 2013, was amazed.
Dale married Osskar Winner, who is 20 years older than he was, but he said that age was never a problem.
"When you're so young, he's been in his first apartment at 14 years of age, and his father died three years after cancer, he said he was hard to find someone who had experienced such a kind of experience.
In June, the couples became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Deley, who said he had changed his “perfect outlook.”
"If you had asked me last year, all this would have connected to "I need to win the golden medal," he said.
"You must know, there are more things than the Olympic gold medals.
I'm an Olympic gold medal Robbie."
His son's name is similar to his father Robert, who died at the age of 40 when he suffered brain cancer in 2011.

He said, “Did I not tell you that you will not be able to endure with me?”
He said: I saw that which they did not eat and I had no control over it until the eyes of my hands were moved, and I thought that he would not die; so I did call to account him for the hour that he passed away.
The next year, Dale took part in the Olympics and won the cricket medal.
"I just knew that this is what I had dreamed of all my life - shooting in the Olympic games, there was no better feeling."

Out-of-form Mkilson out of Saturday road
The American Phillisson will establish record on Sunday when they play their 47th radio-relation tapes, but they have to change their form to avoid becoming a terrible mill.
In the 12th-century program for record, Miklan Jim Führer gave the game out of the game.
Instead of becoming the romantic center, such as he is often made for the United States, the major winner of five times worked in the hope of improving his day and making his way of playing.
Even the 48-year-old player who never drive directly on his career, has not been a model for the 42-year-old golf National Course, where those who have not been active regularly receive a regular punishment of wrong shots.
And where the course isn't so easy, Mr. McKalson will face the British Open Champonsco Molina this week to win all of his four matches.
If the American players living in 12 sings start at four feet down, the match of Mockelson can be very important.
Frank put his trust in his man, not that he could say anything else.
"They fully understood their role, surrounded me in my backpack and in my arms and said they would be ready tomorrow," said Fukric.
"He's so sure of himself.
She is the Hall of Führer and has contributed much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't mean to play her two matches.
I thought more, but it worked, and the way we thought we should proceed.
He wants to go out there anyway.
Michaelson will cross the record of Ni Faldo's record for most of the most playing radio tapes on Sundays.
This radio can mark the end of the carrot car, who never touched the tops of their personal record.
Miklanson has found 18 win, 20 hits and seven shifts, although Fick said that his presence brings some tension in the team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's welcome, he likes to laugh, and his presence in the team room," he explained.
"I think young players also enjoyed visiting them this week, which was fun watching.
He only gives a lot more than to play."
Europe’s Captain Thomas Boone knows that increasing growth can be short - lived
Thomas Bourne, European Captain, knows from his experience that the last day in the Raider cup can be very easy to make.
Dan showed his first show in Valdramama in 1997, where a party in Sive Belstrios had gained the increase of five numbers on Americans, but with the victory of 14-13 C.E., with the victory of 14-13 C.E., the highest killer on the press line.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valdramma; where we were in Brooklyn, where we had our big girlfriends, and in Valdrama, we just had the victory," and then the class was finally won from Friday 5-3 and tomorrow's LIGF.
So history will show me and all the people of that team that it's not over.
You'll pay the full price tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This will not finish until you're able to find a score on the board.
We have a target, and he's trying to win this traffic and that's where to keep focus.
I always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know that the greatest player in the world is standing on the other side."
Bianni added how their players displayed the hard golf course: "I will never get out of myself."
Tomorrow is a different tough time.
We'll come forward tomorrow, and it's a different thing.
When everything goes well, it's nice to go there with the party, but when you get out of there, your ability as a golf.
This is the message which you need to reach to the players with the message tomorrow you are sending.
So you leave his spouse behind and he knows that he has to give his best to him.
Unlike Boron, the opposite is Jim Führer, who was personally interested in a better display for his players who as part of the party, Assassin Zurd Zersette and Justin Thomas, who were three of them.
Prior to the defeat of "a miracle in Macedonia" by Europe, because of being part of the winner team in Brooklyn, Frank himself is on both sides of the last days."
"I remember each of his Lafs," he answered, asking how Captain Ben Cranash managed his players on the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start the fast like you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in the event.
When this speeds up, it puts a lot of pressure on their matches.
And indeed We have created man according to his means, and We have made the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of the people of the land, and verily, We are going to try them (i.e. do good and bad deeds).
Thomas has been assigned to try to take the initiative with the Rorii Maclero at the top of the match, where Paul Casi, Justin Rose, John Smith, Tommy Fitwood and Ian Pattler are a half part of other Europeans.
"I made their group in this order because I think it's covered all," said Boron about his single choices.
The new war in Germany ceased.
In 2014 the new warships of German Nazisms had to be reduced to changing the country's war-sharing strike in 2014, but because of the high cost of misunderstandings and rapid increase, the local media reported that it would not be as much as the next year.
According to the Redland-Puffles newspaper of a military campaign, the "Rainland-Puffles", which is actually the chief of the battleships of the New Banden-Virturberg, now has been released until the first sixth of 2019.
Pot should have been involved in Nasana in 2014, but after the delivery, the issues that disturbed the prominent project affected the fate of the prominent project.
The four Bedden-Vurtburg classrooms were ordered back in 2007 that they will be brought back to the warships of the former British-Americans.
It is thought that they would provide a series of powerful irons, anti-Ejectives and anti-techs with a series of staircases, such as a staircase, ant-stass, and a sound unit.
Other important features include a long-term period of time - it is possible to handle the latest war officers for two years from foreign portals.
Although it means constant delays, it means that Germany may have a chance to receive power projects in foreign countries - until the time to enter the service, Dyin commented.
During the last year, F125 war broke out, when German Nazis officially refused to deport the pope and returned to Holmstrom and Woham Shird in Hamburg.
It was the first time when Nasena returned to the construction of a ship after delivery.
Most people knew about the reasons for return, but the German media quoted several important "software and hardware crimes", which would ruin the war effort.
The staff of software was particularly important because the boat ships of Beden-Virtburg-Virtburgers will be operated by some 120 passengers - which is only half half of the power of the war in the old British series.
Also, it is also believed that the ship is more efficiently capable of reducing his display and restricting the ability to add future development.
7000 tons of the Rhinland-Puffles are considered to be twice heavy with boats used by Germans in the second world war.
Apart from guilt hardware, the whole project's value tag - including the training of the team - is becoming a point.
It's said that it has reached the beginning of 3.2 B.1 billion ($3.6b).
The problem of the new war forces that became especially important in the light of recent warnings is fighting the nine nuclear power of Germany.
At the beginning of this year, the head of the German parliament, Hess-Potals, admitted that in nine years the ships are actually running off the ship."
The matter is serious with time, since the old ships were removed from use, but no permanent ship has been available.
He was not able to join any of the war officers of the Baden-Vurtburg-Virtburg-Resident.
The National Test of Chagas ’ Hidden Life
The purpose of the new research being done in an apartment in Scotland is to open out how to use a natural reflection in their prey for food.
It is being expected that the conclusion will bring new light on the behavior of the uniquely unique mammals and will help guide the future's security activities.
The study conducted by scientists in Scotland's National Trust and along with the Sacrano Papistals, along with the long-colored ears of white-colored children, and the bus is followed by the satinton champagne champs in the wake of West Roses.
In all weather, there will be specific records on the main locations around the moon to track the season.
NHS will also monitor mobile surveys by using the user and volunteers's manuals.
The voice analysis of all the experts of recording is the result of the call and the fact that the subjects are doing what they are doing.
Then the map and report will be prepared for a detailed display of their behavior.
Robb Dwar, the natural defense counselor of NTS, hopes that the results will determine which area of natural gas is the most important and how they are used by each nation.
This information will help to determine the benefits of natural-administration management work, such as the construction of grass fields and how to keep Woodlands well for other countries.
There has been a lot of fall in the last century in Scotland and the whole U.S. population of chimpanzees in the United States and the United States.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect birds' bones and damage natural resources.
The air Turbbin and light system can also pose a threat, for some chemical treatment of floppy and building materials can also cause an attack by petol cats.
The chimpanzees are not really blind.
However, their eyes are more useful than their eyes when their prey comes to catch prey.
They use an effective eco-prout technology to expose the errors and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, who is responsible for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important buildings and 76,000 hackers around the country, is very serious.
It has ten trained experts who regularly observe the birds ’ eggs and sometimes save them.
The organization has established the first of Scotland's first and the only dedicated Batrevews in the 3rd class of Scotland at Domitz and Gallove of Scotland, Scotland.
East Major David Thompson says it's a better place for them.
"Here we have a nice place to kiss," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all good naturals.
But there are a lot of things that are still unknown, so we can help us understand what we're doing here and other times.
They force the importance of checking the kisses before they put it inside the bars because it is possible that it could be destroyed from the loss of their mother-in-laws and their babies, which may be destroyed by the loss of all local population.
Chagas are protected and is illegal to kill them and kill them, cause or cause trouble or destroy their bones.
Elizabeth Farrell, the head of the Bat Communication Trust, has encouraged the public to come forward to help.
They said, "We still have much to know about our tastes."
Ronandado was sentenced to rape while lawyers accused the German magazine
Christiano Ronadho called them "sudden news" and said that people want to preach using their name.
His lawyer is going to trial the German news newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
In 2009, Cathrian Mayora, the American woman, was accused of rape in the hotel room of Las Vegas at Las Vegas.
Deer Spiegel told on Friday that she paid the woman $3375,000 to keep quiet about this incident.
Following the report of his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo told the reports to the report.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is the debt news, "it's five times a bull D'O won in the camera."
"They want to preach by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be popular with my name, but it's part of their work.
I'm a happy person and all right," the player smiled.
The lawyer of Rolando is preparing to run the case for the charges on the Speakel, according to Rotters, who said they were "in doubtless reporting in the region of Gondel."
The lawyer Christian Shirtz said that the player would demand moral protection in the matter of July, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is said that the last event happened in June 2009, in Las Vegas's Palms Hotel and Chino.
According to Clark County Court of Nepal, after meeting in a Night Club, Roandeldo and Meorga returned to the player's room as described by her as being raped with her.
Merogana claims that after the event, Ronniedo fell down on his knees and said that he was a "99 percent" who were disappointed by "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronandado confirmed that this couple had sex, but it was agreed.
Meeorga also claims that she was also approached by the police and was even drawn to her head in a hospital, but later she agreed to compromise because she felt “resentment from the court” and was concerned about being “reverently humiliated.”
34-year-old says that he is now trying to end this agreement because he has continued persecution since his birth.
At the time of Rolando's attack, the manager was on duty to join the Royal University, and in this summer, Italian diggage dealt with the Italian Dagwe.
Breaks: UK will have to be sorry for losing contraction '
Business Secretary Greg Clark said that U.K. would regret "for peace" if he lost his post as world leader in the car after the break.
He told the BBC that if the British left the European Union, he would temporarily stop producing his product in Bernton.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
Japanese car manufacturer said that the limit may have been affected by long-term delays in the state of No-Del Breaket.
The Bernon Polton plant - who produces ostea's Orices and Ascinances - last year, about 15000 cars were exported into the rest of the European Union, with 90% of them being exported to the rest of the European Union.
Martin Cook, director of Toyotto in Bernton, said, "I believe that if Britain exits the European Union at the end of March, we will stop producing in our factory."
Other U.K. car manufacturers have been able to work business across the border with the BMW and the worldland Rover Rover, with an agreement on how to leave EU without agree.
For example, BMW says he's gonna shut down his mini-Pant for a month after a break in Oxford.
According to the car manufacturers, primary concerns are related to the risk of breast cancer in the state of No-delal Breaket.
Toyota's product is followed by the "Ste-in-Tim", with the U.K. and the European Union, each in 37 minutes from the Mad-To-Order Cars in each 37 minutes.
If U.K.K.K. leaves the European Union without any income on March 29, there may be an abuse on the limit, according to the work, that could be reduced by taxation and debt.
The company said it would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than one day's intuition, so the product will be closed.
Mr. Clark said that for future relations with the European Union, the Cherry's checks have been "cleanly designed to protect those tests."
"We need money. We want a better deal that can't only enjoy success in my view but that is also necessary to achieve this opportunity," they told the BBC radio 4 program.
"Not only Toyota but also other creators have evidence that we should fully be able to continue that which is the most successful success of all of the natural species."
Toyota was unable to say how long the product would be stopped, but in a long time, warning cautions that additional expenses will be reduced and that workers will eventually run.
Peter Suvallis, who has been working for 24 years in Bernton, said that their members are very worried: "One time in my experience, they never come back in Bedden after they're gone."
One government official said: "We have promoted a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the European Union."

When asked about the meeting of Rostenin, he said: “The date is not set for this week, this week can be, I can see that all other matters are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always like to put the press up."
Some reporters have claimed that Sanders have not broadcast the White House's press since September 10th.
Host Chris asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of the "superiority" of the lack of video broadcasts was not due to the lack of success, but he said, "I'm not sure that they are great."
He then suggested to improve the contact between the Trom and the press.
He said, "We have seen these numbers."
Breffing will still be, but "If the press has an opportunity to ask direct questions from the President of the United States, it is better to talk to me."
We try to do so and you've seen us doing a lot of this past few weeks and when you can talk to the President of the United Kingdom, you're going to take a place to talk about."
When sharing in open sessions or in open sessions or in open sessions or with maths in press conferences, trucks regularly answer questions in press conferences.
A single press conference is rare.

In his letter, Miss Freeman wrote: “In the Germans, the debate continues between the U.K. and the European Union, the waiting decisions are going on.
But the U.K. government is also extending his preparations for possible No-Doll.
I know it's gonna have been a long time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to repeat now that I value their contribution without concern for the nationality of each staff member.
The European Union and its fellow workers bring with it valuable experience and skill that strengthen and improve the health service, and benefit the sick and the communities we serve.
Scotland is exactly your home and we want you to stay here."

That's what I got B cap and that's the only thing," Ross told the Spirits of BBC Scotland.

"I really believed that management was better fit for me than to play.
It seems strange because I did the right thing, earned it right, and some of the exact ones enjoyed it.
But playing can be hard.

By using the fire pipes, the mother’s cow of a mother’s milk made a difference in the opinion of the online people
One breast-feed company divided online opinion by an advertisement that compares breast milk to cow milk.
In order to mark the launch of "The First Bamp of the World" as the world's first-class branding product, the user Tech Elve launched a new funny video series, which allows the new Pope mothers to express their freeness of expression.
Four real mothers in the grass dance to a song with some kind of words, saying, "Yes, I'm milky, but you don't see anything."
Koss continues: "Patt out, pipe, et out, I'm going to feed the baby, your pipes out, your pipes out of here, I'm Milling Lady."
Anyway, the advertisements that are published on Facebook page are a cause of online debate.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has been mixed with audiences, many said that it offers the "rightness" of the diary industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows for this product's advertisement.
As we need to give birth and bear children, only in a few days after giving birth, they are robbed." One wrote:
Elvises get stuck within the Elvises National nursing bridge.
Another comment: “World for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise the British Pope for mothers who have the opportunity to keep their children alive?"
Another couple said: "What is an indictment."
Others saved the advertisement, one of which said they were "disgusting".
"I think it's a great idea.
I would have had this also, if I had still been nursing.
Papping really makes me experience to be a song.
It's a little strange, but I saw it like that.
One wrote that it's a good product."
Others observed: “This is a fun advertisement for the mothers who do (or others in their work or school) and like "gay".
It's not whether to promote or not the delivery industry or not."
At the end of the video, a group of women told us that they were taking care of their brands.
The absence of this campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who say they feel like a cow.
However, Elve Pop remains well hidden, there is no wire or tube, and carefully fit into a nursing bridge, without touching the women, letting their children go, and even abroad.
Anna Ballerin, partner and ECD in Murray, ECD commented: "Aviary pipe is a performer product of a giant and a brilliant loot.
By comparing the songs of women and of the Deer, we want to bring up the staircases and its challenges, showing a spirit of freedom of mind and relationships, which will bring them to the platform.
It's not the first time that Elv Pop is in the kitchen.
During a week of the London Festival, a mother of two children who used to use products was seen as a catota for Jacqbsky.
Hundreds of traveling children quietly went to a Tet Camp on the border of Texas
Even when the monthly limit of crossing has been officially changed, for a limited number of reasons have made it difficult for children to set up the hard curves and policy used by the Trophy administration.
Traditionally, most users had set out without a document and were afraid to risk their own ability to live in the country.
The danger increased in June, when organized authorities announced that possible users and other members of the house would give their own attention and the data would be shared with non-profit authorities.
Last week, a senior officer of Matthew Elbes, Assad and the border government presented the evidence of the Congress of Congress that the EZC has arrested a number of people who were willing to submit to non-nursing numerals.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested people have already had no serious record.
"80 percent of those who are users or are members of the organizer's house are who live illegally in the country and are more criminals."
So we continue to search for those people," said Mr Albins.
As soon as the children were ready, the authorities offered a new law, which required the children to be arrested within a month of 60 days, which was a standard standard for those who sought refuge.
Many are exposed to video conferences instead of to present their case directly to the legal position of an alien judge.
Those who are considered inappropriate to be free are immediately expelled.
As long as the children remain under ban, they have the chance to remain in their seats or depressed, which may be due to the violence or efforts of the system in recent months, according to the system's report.

Mahmal, who works as a sub-sidiary minister, says that the foreign army is illegal in the European land and will be treated with the same."
"They must leave the war immediately and without any situation," they told the man.
Malcolm emphasized that “the war has ended in Syria, where more and more people have died from 2011 to 320,000 deaths, and a number of millions have been expelled from their homes.
He said: "As far as Damascus is concerned, the world will continue to fight until we make all the terrorist groups and "no foreigners" clear all the Syrian areas."
The United States has some 2,000 military power, mainly in the spring of the President Ash Al-Assad and the Syrian army forces.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the land that destroyed war.
On the case of refugees, Malcolm said that the conditions were right to return, and he held responsible for "some Western countries" to "transgress the fear of the boy" who moved the refugees away.
They said, "We invite international communities and human organizations to make it easier."
"They were in a completely political position on human affairs."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no help to rebuild Syria until there was no political compromise between the conflict and the war.
The United States states that an opportunity to force a mutual political discussion between Russia and Turkey in the last major rebellion in Edlib creates an opportunity to take a stand against political discussion.
Russian-Turkic Del, or the parliament, lets a massive attack on the Russian-shared Syrian forces in that province, where three million people lived.
Although Mahmali said that it is "critical time" and that it is hoped that military action would be followed by military action and that the war will be followed by the war-represented by the military and that it will be delivered."
The President of the United Kingdom will soon be expecting a new meeting with the government and members of the government to prepare for a new meeting after the war to improve the way of Syria and the choice.
Malcolm held some conditions in committees for the Syrian government's participation, which said that "to review the articles of the current system" and warn against intervention."

But only Al Salvador was sentenced to death, who received $140 million in the United States in 2017 with the nuclear control, development and financial aid.
The proposed punishment, which included cutting and selling and selling restrictions in financial aid, would be painful for Central American countries and its higher unemployment and murder rates.
When the internal meeting or meeting was made, North American and Central American authorities, like the past year, stopped the conference and economic prosperity of the high-scaring community, which was forced to stop the campaign from going to the United Nations.

What if Mr. Tempry General Rod Rosentin, the person who controls the final results of Mr. Muriel's investigation, will we do what?
Rostenin has been in this confusion since last year when this paper has reported it, he suggested to keep the president's record secret and consider their mistake for the office.
Mr. Rosentin said the time's account isn't correct.
"If recently requested, the F.B.I.I.I.D. is not fully complete or neutral - or if he stands firm in the Supreme Court despite the charges of corruption and false witness, how will we react?
