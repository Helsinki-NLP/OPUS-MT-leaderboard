John Edward: Global citizens need language skills
The free school of Scotland maintains its success in education, and it has also been in 2018, with another feature of the extraordinary tests, which have been attributed only to sports, art, music, and other cultural activities.
Over 30,000 students in all Scotland are represented by the School for Schools of Gilead (SCISS), which is threatened by the top priority of their students and parents.
The goal is to prepare their students for the next and higher schools for their chosen career and to serve as a global citizen.
As a teacher in the United States, a number of schools have been able to organize and enforce preschool courses, so modern - day students are watching the subject of a popular and willing choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, it will be straight to his head.
"If you speak in a language of understanding, it will go straight into his heart.
It is important to remember that we cannot depend only on English to establish relationships and trust in people from other countries.
With the results of recent testing, we can see that the high altitudes of the high altitudes at the top of the top of the high school are at the League tables.
In the United States, 68 percent of the students learned foreign languages received a high grade A.
The data collected from SCIS's 74 member schools has been found that 72 percent of the students received high grade A in Madrid, but the number of German students was 72 percent, and the number of French students who received it was 63 percent.
This shows that the free school in Scotland supports foreign languages as important as important educational skills, which children and young class need in the future in the future.
The language is now considered to be the same as in the free school course, and other schools are now being conducted in the same way as the SISTM (USSS, technology, engineering, and therapeutic).
In 2014, U.S.A., U.S.A., a survey published by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (WHO), found that because of the lack of language skills to fill an empty space, 17 percent of the languages were reported.
Thus, the young class is more fully equipped to prepare for their future assignments.
These skills have become necessary in a world where the need for language is greater.
If they have learned another language, they can have a real benefit in the future.
Because of the ability to communicate openly with foreigners in the foreign - language field, the contest will be the first one to be held at the top of the contest.
According to a survey of over 4,000 adults in Ukraine in 2013, 75 percent of the adults in the United States were unable to speak a foreign language, and only 15 percent of the French - speaking population, including 15 percent.
This is especially important for children today, since language education is important for them.
If many languages are available, children will be able to provide a fine opportunity for meaningful recreation, especially in developed developed economics.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
Many schools focus more on modern languages, but others teach languages that are considered important to Ukraine, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there are many languages in which to choose free schools, and there is a qualified teacher class to teach in the field.
SCIENTISTS are dedicated to providing a educational environment, who will prepare students for the future and who will be able to make skills to succeed.
At this point, a global business environment cannot deny that language is important to the future of the country, so it is important to have a mental education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as "International communication skills".
This will be the choice for young students of the free school of Scotland.

The students of Harvard University are studying enough to have enough rest.
The Harvard University of California has conducted a new study for men who are growing up by Cafeen-ssen-sensing people this year to meet the culture of all his preschool students.
A university professor found that they were generally unaware of how to care for basic information about how to care for their physical needs at a university in one of the world’s universities.
Charles Chisser, professor at Harvard Medical School, and Professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School, has developed a study that is considered to be the first of his research.
They were motivated to start the study when they were away from sleep.
“ At the end of her talk, a girl came to me and said: ‘ Why did I say this to you when I was last year?
She said that she didn't tell anyone about the importance of sleeping; she told the telegraph.
This study, which was first introduced this year, explains how students and athletes need to develop good sleep habits for their work and for their normal health.
Paul Barry, director of the medical profession at Harvard Medical School and at the university, said that the university has decided to start the study after the students have been diagnosed with serious sleeps during the week.
In one hour, this study is a master of communication goals.
In one area, there is a photograph of the Dom room, where students take coffee, and the effects of cancer and the lack of sleep affect the work of athletes, teachers, and books that highlight the value of the law of sleep.
Participating in other parts of the world is said to increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, heart attacks, and cancer.
In addition, after a map of the campus, participants are moved to think about their routine.
"We know that this will not change the conduct of the students.
But we have to believe that they have the right to know - as you have the right to know the health consequences of smoking.
The culture of pride is still in existence, he said, it was an increase in modern technology and the pressure on students to stay awake.
To ensure good quality, sufficient sleep must be a secret weapon to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety — even to prevent growth — because it keeps the brain from sleeping, and it is necessary to keep the brain from sleeping.
The 19th - year - old Ramon Sand Sonzler, learned by experience, helped to develop this study, which he had been enrolled in Harvard during his first year of his life.
He explained that the study opened his eyes, and he moved into the campus.
He hopes that in the next step, all these self - sacrificing students will be told that they must complete such studies before they enter into the contest.
Professor Chisser recommended that students go to bed and warn them about time and time to get up, and be alert to the harmful effects of the electromagnetic screens and the LD light - which will cause sleep problems in your body.

In any case, for the second time in the absence of the Lord's Marseilles, Johnny England has been sent to the second time, and his name indicates that he has a huge chemical design for those looking for Simmones in the region.
He's obviously a stupid cigarette agent who has a little mixed up in La Glagow galmer, but he's a little bit like Klasso (Mrásso) and gives him a note of the event in 2012 The Chryteaus of the London Olympics.
They add confusion to the confusion that is once forgotten by the Barciccards of television programs, which are based on the customs and sensibilities of the public and the international community.
The latest JE film also has a two-two moment moment.

New war broke out in Germany once again
In 2014 the latest battleships of Germany had to be operated by war fighters during the war in the Balkans, but because of the bad system and the prices, the local media reported that it would not be loaded at least for the next year.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, the "Hand-Faz" operation of the main ship in the Bedan-Vuttenberg-Vütburg-Refz has been delayed for the first six months since the first six months of the 20th century.

In addition, the whole project has been a problem with the training of the team.
It's from early 2.2 billion - amazingly magnificent.1.6 billion ($3.6 billion).
The latest battles on the background of the Nazi occupation of Germany were especially significant.
At the beginning of this year, the chief of the security committee of the German Parliament admitted that the boat is indeed a "transgressive ship."
The centurion said that the ship is in trouble, because the old ships have been torn down, but they don't stay in their place.
He lamented that no war fighters in the Banden-Vuberts are capable of being loaded into a boat.

Why do Mr. Kwana and her Republican supporters need to examine the FBI?

There are only 6 weeks for middle-class elections, on November 6th - if the Republic's work is done, it would be too late to send someone to the highest court in their country.
Mr. Kwanganna took the phone to call for the produce of the fruit of those who support Kahwana. Mr. Kenangue was working for Mr. Vanoga Houthouse, and was also recognized as his wife, Mr. Kwanh's wife, as well as his wife, Assas.

In the north, many entrances have been given a citizen of South Korea.
In the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans were forced into exile.
Many have lived in China with the North Korean border, and it is easier to cross the border than to cross the country (DMZ).
The Chinese are known as foreign immigrants and sends them back into exile rather than to exile.

He said: “This is the way Jehovah has blessed his people and has blessed them with the privilege of bearing witness to his name. ”
"I think they've decided to force themselves to follow their classmates and Clinton and Democrat."
When he was appointed Kwana, and when he received a lot of money at the Kingdom Hall of the Democratic Republic of Congo, he wondered if the Polish Brethren would present questions about their legal status.
"I would say that they would not tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, but not in the Supreme Court, but not in the Supreme Court."
Kwana is currently judges in the DC's operating circuit court.
Philosophers say that the Democratic Republic of Congo is concerned about its potential standing up against their possible claims, since Canadians are viewed as a Russian judge.

I'm angry."
Then they continued.
And I thought this was strange."
The tears of those being oppressed are temporary. They are permitted to express their anger because they have a basic wrong view of them.
One of the hard memories of my early job, in the office of a man and a man with whom I once saw me crying, was an old woman with a loud voice, and I was afraid of the cold blood of my neck and of the wall.
"They will never see you in tears." She told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are sad, and they will be glad."

They were so overwhelmed by the feeling that they would not begin to express their appreciation for the people who support them - to - defending the system, instead of focusing on position, money - and sexual matters rather than on the system of voters.
