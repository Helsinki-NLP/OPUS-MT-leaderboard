Black box in your car?
While the U.S. road designer, the U.S. director of the U.S. government of the U.A., is struggling with less money to improve the high-speed high-technock system, there are many people looking at its solution in small black box, which leads to your car's death.
This device, which tracks every mile driving by motor- driver and communicates the information to authorities, has become a controversial effort for Washington and the Kingdom Office.
In general, such as high-technology, it has become a matter of sudden confusion and life-diversity.
You probably have found the library environment groups to support the use of these black boxing groups in support of these black boxing groups.
The tea party is serious.
American citizen freedom organization is also concerned with taking a different kind of privacy points.
While Congress didn't agree whether the future would be to be done or not, many Kingdom waits.
They're looking for how they can go into a system that is set up on the street for each mile.
Thousands of motor-trackers have already taken the black box for the test drive, with some of which has G.PS. monitoring.
It's actually an essential object for our country.
"It's not the subject of choosing or not to be selected," says Hasan Iraq, a member of the South California government organization who is planning to start track each mile set by motor drivers in California by 2015.
We're about to change our way of paying.
It's a means to do that.
The main reason is that the country's high-state feed has become almost Delhi, which is due to the payment of taxes made by American citizens.
Americans don't buy much gas anymore.
Now in a Galen gas, the car runs more than before.
No increase in the last 20 years in Federal Texas, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high value of Gas, the state government refuses to increase a money in taxis.
According to the University of Minnesota, it's not an impossible thing.
Their kingdom has recently set up a tracking device in 500 cars to test the payment system.
They say, "In the past it will work as the most logical option."
Vonx calls it a Miles-based user Shudash.
It is not surprising that this idea seems to be good to the city generousists, for example, to change the trades to make a car run as a car, which can help to reduce and reduce Grihas's gas.
California's planning plans are looking forward to this system while they are developing the goals set in the Global Voices laws of the State.
But the president of the Home Transport Committee, Rep. B. B. Shuster (A.P.A.) also believes the Black Box's long-term options.
Free vendors in the Regen Foundation also are in favor of miles per mile payment by the driver.
At Reingen's Chief of Policy, Adrian Moror said, "It's not doing this, that's not what you're doing to the blind."
People are being paid more clearly for what they are receiving.
The campaign has also been supported by two former American travel secretary who had been blessed to move from Congress in 2011 to the direction of the payment of the payment from Congress in its report.
U.S. senate accepted the test project of 90-million dollars last year, including 10,000 cars.
But working on the rural system-in-laws, who were represented by people who had to go to work or go to the city, ended the proposal there.
Yet many kingdoms and cities are moving on their own.
It is the most fascinating Organan, who has been listed by 5,000 players in the country’s largest use.
These drivers will soon pay the Miles rule rather than the Kingdom.
Nevada has already completed the initial experiment.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Ilinos is trying with trucks on limited basis.
And I-95 volumes, including 17 state travel departments with East Sibod (including Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), are studying how they can act on this change.
This idea was not supported by all places.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were soon put on this device, drivers were very tired to think that the government could monitor their every move.
“Bagn was a major problem with Bang Braden and other things about the same type of things.”
It's not something people wanted.
In addition to further testing, NVL.U warned on his website: "It would be too easy to convert these devices into a full tracking device."
There is no need to develop the vast, unprejudiced technology structure, which must be expanded to record every person’s daily coming-out record.
Navada is one of the many kingdoms who are trying to achieve the amazing achievement that the Kingdom is going to find out how many miles the car is going, but not where and when is she and what time is going on?
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more easily.
The discovery of the project led some state agencies to the little California started-up.
It wasn't in the business to help the players actually rule.
This was trying to get into the market in Oto insurance, which drivers had to pay on the basis of their miles.
But the device that is testing this is pleasing to the High Plans, because it does not use the GPS and provides a limited amount of information, which will be uploaded on a specified interval.
He said, ‘Indeed if you leave [the city] with them, you will not take them away until they leave it.’ But if you do not drive them away, they will surely provoke you.
In these initial events of the Kingdom, there have been some serious mistakes.
There's also a lot of money spent to do this, and there's a way to do it.
In Organ, the schemers are using different-time options.
They can choose GPS. With or without GPS devices.
Or you may not select any more than one device, but you can choose to provide a fixed price based on the average level of the state's inhabitants.
Other places expect that more access to the device can be sold to concerned citizens.
In New York City, Transport authorities are trying to develop a technology that will also be useful to pay for the parking meter strike, "The payoff" will provide insurance according to your drive, and other drivers will create a collection of real time data from other drivers that can be used to save traffic traffic traffic.
The city is mentioned in the city planning document, "Mator- driver will be drawn to participation because of its benefits."
However, some travel planning may surprise that there is a lot of discussion on payment according to Miles.
In the San Francisco Bay region, Metropolitan Passeng said that Congress can easily deal with the problem by increasing gas tanks in gas taxis.
In addition to the hardware or other cars, there may be an additional time or annual waste of time, which does not use too much gas to pay their proper share.
The Ayog's statement and public coverage of public affairs said, "When you can work with the Espian, what do you need to do?"
If we do so, millions of cars will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.

Froster Airlines Care - On the Backgas.
Fort Airlines is planning to charge $100 for passengers on your plane.
The plan to start the charge for a car - on Airlines is to start $100 for a car, and it's gonna take $2 for coffee or release, but the passengers say that the Wednesday can keep the entire disk.
The new car - on the branch is for the bag, so, under the seat, the little bag will be suspended.
Frantier said that $25 would be paid to the Advens, $100 wait if the passengers wait to pay until they're at the gate.
Frantor Prime Minister O'Mill said he had to get to care for the charge in the US 100 French passengers.
"We don't want him to charge," he said.
Airlines started charge for the first and second test bag in 2008.
Those who are trying to survive are filling out as many as they can do in the car - on the bag, which has a scan in the Overhead room, means that there's little place in this database.
There's a way to reduce the passengers on the board.
O'MILY said it's not really about making a new charge money.
It's hard to find out about the most loyal clients about Frotier that have become the most difficult thing to find out about overhead Bin.
The passengers who buy tickets on their website of the Airlines don't have to give it.
That means that the next person in the line might pay a hundred dollars for the same bag, while a travelingr on the line can get a bag, a bag.
O'Malley said that the website and the check operations of the Fort are being changed to the press before getting the gate.
Frotier's new carree - on press, will not start until summer though a date has not been specified.
Travelers often express agreements about Biggze branch and other branch, but the plane services like them.
They reason that they spend money to handle the Bigge, and those who want to serve should pay for it.
A number of people are looking at Beggs on Wall Street as a sign that many Airlines are paying enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years.
Most of them don't even have a car - on the bank.
Sparet Airlines Inc. started three years ago, and the partner's Agent Algeliot Air later.
The same is the Vizz Err of the other Airlines hacker, who said sorenson, and who tracks the Aed - On Fish.
He said that the Sparret's car - an on-on hair brought $50 million in a year which was estimated to be in the December 2011 report.
Soreensen, a former officer of the Midwest Airlines recently flew into Sparit and passengers were surprised to meet Carrie - on the gate with an unusual bag.
"The boarding process that I saw was easy in my Airline career," he said.
I expected to see the dentist and a fight gate out.
"The man was full and he said it's green-sucked."
Frantier is also following the $2 rule for coffee, coffee, tea, soda, or gambling.
Frottier is good that the passengers who leave, or take a juror, can keep the whole shield, and this free coffee will only be given for once.
It'll still take away water.
In 2008, the US Airways tried to charge for drinking drugs, but after seven months of interrogation, they left behind and followed after any other major Airlines.
Frottier's passengers don't buy directly from the Eerieline, so this step of the Franiter - is his latest effort to contact the customers of their own website.
Airlines pays online traffic vendors for $20 from $25 to $25 for a ticket.
That's why all Airlines have been encouraged to buy passengers directly from those online traffickers rather than go through an online traffic agency.
Frantier, though, has gone ahead in this area.
In September several times, flights were often sold to customers who bought an online truck agency from these guys.
On Wednesday, it reduced Miles Averdant to 25 percent of the trip mile.
So, a 1,000 miles from an online traffic agency will release a thousand miles away from the Fort trip 250 miles away.
It also allows single passengers to choose their seat for the first time when they buy directly from the Franiter website.
Frantier's a loyal bus in his home city in Denver, but it's getting less business and losing it.
The 9 percent fall and its flying capacity in the first quarter have been less than 13%, according to the Corporate Airways Herald Herald Hodgings Inc.
Trying to determine the cost of Franter as part of the Republical Ereline's sale.
NS.A.A. reported "In internal error" instead of causing the website to crash.
The secret national security agency told Friday that our website was closed for a few hours, not because of hackers, as some claimed online.
In an e-mail sent by the security agency, "Today the night hasn't reached NSA.gov for several hours, which caused an internal error during the previous update."
This problem will be solved this evening.
It's not true that this barrier, distribution of service [D.D.S.] came due to attack.
At evening the online server drivers found that the website of NSA was closed for at least six hours, and the site is not yet available for some users.
The NSA's vice president told the AB.C. News that the agency's internal, sensitive network was “not even upset” with the internal, sensitive network of agency.
The president said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one Haititic group has claimed online that they are responsible to restrict the website of the NSA by the DD.S. attack.A.
DD.O.S. attack is designed so much on the target website so far, until the site is closed because of the server overloaded.
This is expected to be illegal and does not reveal the internal network of attacks on the internal network of the target target system.

As the plane's designer, they fell into the bathroom of Bombarder, down in orders.
Canada's Air and Trainer Bombarder Inc reported 15 percent of the loss of the Master's goods in clean health, in three-dimensional units, and under the command and pressure of the planes of his train in India.
Not even Bombarder, based on his brand new Siecess plane, did not offer an update on any of his ambitions to attend the next September or the air service.
About half a month before the test plane's first flight, it's just flying three times, question whether the test is on the track or not.
The result fell down from premium and sent for more than 8 percent more than 8 percent of the slides in the Sher Toton Stock Exchange.
A analyst with the National Bank Phenchil, with the National Secretary had reduced his rating to "the region of the field" to the Master, the store was limited to one or two thirds.
"Cameer plane deliver was most expected, we are obviously disappointed with the Marvin exhibition in transportation, "Dorson said in a client note."
We'll get a new order for Bombarder Cerees as progress as the flight test program.
However, if no new orders are being announced in months, doubt the market program will be satisfied.
Bombarder hopes the plane family now can cut it off at least at the end of the power market of Boing and Airbes.
The first test took place in March and was flying for the first time after the delay.
The possibility that the new jetliner is waiting for the results of the flying experiments of the company's tests to acknowledge the potential dangers and potentially possible survival of the company's teeth but, as well as the firm order for Cereiss is in between 1777 and 1777.
With 15 clients and operators, 403 are available full order and contraction.
The chief executive Pierre Baudin believed Bodin will finish his 300-more-more-work target from the time Bombarder first used the jet trade.
The authorities assured the media that the program was following the list.
"Frane lived on the ground for a long time compared to the first plane," said Bodoin in a conference call, adding it to the ground testing and software update.
Every maker makes a schedule in a different way.
We've decided to fly a first and an update period and say what we have done.
That flight program will be all through that.

A huge change is taking place in the KladCoping roof where European authorities are more aware that data stored in the United States is under the authority of that area and therefore potentially sensitive.
According to a survey published by the Cloid Security Agency, some 10 followers of the U.S. members of the U.S. were released to use a U.S.-based constituency program after opening the data-based constituency program.
Jim Schnab, with SAP, says: "We have seen a new question that did not come to customers a year ago - that's called hira data? And can you guarantee that it will remain in that state?
Many German authorities have argued that the latest reports were just confirming what they already knew: powerful governments want to steal their most precious secrets and data and so that they should have all the prices.
That's not a surprise.
It's always come.
"This is a topic for many years, and through the original discussion, "Don't change anything," says Kurt Bok, head of the chemical product BASF.

Georgia’s teenage parents believe that their son was killed in “an accident”
A youth in Georgia whose dead body was found in her high school district in Zombie, believes that their son was murdered by the family's secretary.
Valdosta, G.A.K. KK. Johnson was found in the front of his high school districts on 11 January.
The researchers of London's County Sheriff concluded that Johnson died in a ‘an accident’, but the 17-year-old boy’s family refused it.
Benjamin Kom, who presented Keneth and Jacklin Johnson, said to Fox Newz Dot, “They fully believe their son was murdered.”
They don't trust in death in the way the Sherif described.
He said, "They believe that it's a physical law and the argument of common sense."
They feel that it is an excuse for the death of their son or for the safety of people.
He said, "They sent your son to school with a book-back, and he returned to a body bag."
The U.S. President Michael H. Michaele told the Master that he was examining an official investigation of Johnson's death, seeing that there are many important questions.
What was the cause of death?
Did he die because of any crime?
He spoke these words to the governor in the afternoon, saying,
I will follow the facts, and they shall bring us wherever we go.
My purpose is to bring the truth to the truth.
He said, "I think there's an environmental cause for an official investigation."
Muray told the reporter that the death of Johnson was due to the "Study Whitestone".
According to Murray, a second test found a different reason for death."
He said, "There are many questions that should be answered or confirmed."
Murray also said that if he found enough evidence to put down a criminal in the case of Johnson's death or check the citizen rights, he will ask F.B.I. to do it.
Delegates are not immediately available for comments from the Londez County Sheriff's office when contacting the Thursday.
On Wednesday, South Georgia’s judge ordered the authorities to continue all the surveillance videos discussed by the investigator.
The boy's parents say they hope they'll find some signs from the video football how his death was.
The CDC continued the rise of children's rise-in-laws for colleges.
By Wednesday, the disease control and preventing the child’s diet in school, the border continued to control the child’s food agency.
The U.S. government has been released for the first time, since the number of children going to college is increasing from food allergies.
Now in U.S., one of every 20 children has food allergies.
C.D.C. found that 18 percent of children between 1997 and 2007 have increased in the cases of food allergies.
In this direction, schools have been notified how teachers and workers should be directed to the children’s food allergy, and how to handle it, in the case of an angel reaction.
Schools are also recommended to have a stock of the appnefères to deal with a potentially unequivocally fast gas (Analyphicus) - which is the auto-ejector of Appen Brand, which is commonly used.
The State Council has recently updated the rules, which can easily be used in high school.
The report also includes a list of common signs that are being communicated by children suffering from an allergic response.
The children might say, "It sounds like something's going on in my tongue." "It sounds like my tongue's hair" or "My tongue is messing with the tongue."
Parents of InternetKeys can choose their children's ‘ sexually transmitted ’ of their children
Germany has become the first country in the European Union, which has been recognized as the third ring for children born with an unwanted population.
New children will no longer be specified by men or women.
According to the new law, parents do not need to announce sex to such children, the law allows them to declare the child’s birth “inculcate” or “unreasonable” on the child’s birth.
The aim of the new law is to reduce stress over the parents who can make decisions related to sexual-techism decisions for newborn children quickly, and fight prejudice against Internet children.
According to B.C., an interactive man said years later, "No, I'm a man, not a woman."
I'll be ready to be dressed, trained by doctors.
According to estimates, every year 2,000 children are born without a child, not a child.
They are intersex, part of the group of about 60 cases, which triggers the test of sexual development, which is used for an unusual quality, genetics (anthracy or weight), or an unusually developed gender.
Maybe Wells Simmons is on the Internet.
The gender identity is not still considered well, but most experts in the United States believe that it is better to use the best information available to specify the gender when it is no-orderable and if it's done, to improve the physical and physical development of the child's mental and physical development.
According to Dr. Jack Drew of New York City's mentalist Dr. Dyer, who is experts of the gender-page case, he said that the new law of Germany appears to be "good things."
Interactions create moral disintegration.
He said, "Some people are in the same state as the soul needs health care, but most of them don't."
You can specify the same gender without a science, and then see how the identity is developed.
Science is not very precise to know how a sex will develop in a child.
No one can answer correctly why this happens.
It's a kind of puzzle that people are gay.
In the report of the European Commission in 2011, Internets have been described as different from transxul or transversive people, since their status is not related to sex but is not directly related to its biological structure, which is not clearly male or both.
These features can be displayed by double sexual features, such as the weight of the meatpes, the distribution of hair, the development and length of hair; the primary sexual orientation and genetics, or the quality of the quality of the structure and hormone.
This report provides a report of discrimination, violence, and discrimination on the part of the students in the area by the Internet and transgenders.
Now there are special camps for non-sexual girls.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed older people to mark men, women, or "three gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norman May-Wowby became the first "unindulnerable" person after winning the legal appeal for life.
According to the Internal Ministry, the German passport will also be defined as a third of the Internet people besides M or F in German passports.
According to the report on France 24, the points related to gender in neighboring France are still controversial.
In 2011, hundreds of French rules from the Catholic country have signed on the application to go back to the books of college for “sexual principles”.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed this law of Germany, saying, "When the world is going to be in such a state, it's the option for the gender to be selected, but not the Yastan verb, we are taking two other columns in the opposite direction."
The newborn baby's mother in Maryland also told baby John that she would like to have sex specified during the birth of the children.
He said on the website of Perry, "There's too much stress without limits, especially if you don't know what your child's sex is."
Children need stability and stability.
Historically, both men and women were called Hermpherides (Guningi), a beautiful Greek god named bilingual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world believed the gender as a steel which could be removed and written again.
But now many people are facing the moral decline of medicine, they realize that gender-human activity, and sometimes even doctors who don't know what their gender will feel about when they are older.
“In the middle of the 20th century, ” says Dr.
When the children were born, you didn't call me a psychologicalist, you called a professional-Chistak.
The current principle about treatment of the unborn children was presented by Dr. John Hopkins University, who believed to have sex with sex.
They created the word "long identity" and argued on how social and environmental sign - the parents of the child - decide to identify him with Jean and Hormones as men.
But in a matter of 1966, their principles became controversial.
They were a child whose gender had been hit by an accident during the course of the sacsimism (communication), advised K's parents to get out of the eggs, and like her daughter-in-law's daughter.
She said, "I have sought to seduce her [Musa's (Moses)] sister, and she has made a good end of her affair, but she has not done it."
In 15 years of age, the child changed himself as man and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Dr. Darcher said that some doctors are still “following the same pattern. ”
But with the arrival of Internet in the year 1990, these gender-chicking people began to come in front of "not happy."
This was the case with the 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce, who was born with X.V. man, but his population was unsatisfied.
Doctors didn't clearly understand that his gender was young, or his passion was bigger, but they were sure he could never live as a man.
Thus, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external body and the Andcochchchic-Cicitriss were removed by Sachitris and his prefecture girl.
She was given a woman Hormon at 12 years of age.
He said to ABCNews.com, "I knew I'm not a girl."
I wasn't happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At 18 years of age, he was going to have to be an Evolutionist.
But feeling insecure and some confusion, he requested medical archives.
That made him aware of the fear of the truth.
When I was born, I was married - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, who prevented his body from producing teststones in a sufficient amount, which caused his population to not develop properly.
After knowing the truth, he became a man, he stole teststone and removed his cell.
He was left alone because of surgery.
Today, he explains his view of the Internet people in the Interpol project to make people feel normal.
However, the method of California-based group of advocates for the Unequivocates Act Ener-Martice, director of the United States Law, expressed concern that the law of German law "op and shame."
He says, "Many activists think that the law of Germany will move parents to make immediate decisions and to assign the child to the "freedom".
We're afraid it will encourage the intervention.
We think it's better to specify men or women gender rather than wait.
But we don't know how the law works, so we can only guess.
Termer-Metz said that their organization supports the Australian law because "this allows the elderly to be recognized in the third ring."
He said, "The elderly should be able to make their own decision about sex."
The law of Germany is related to specifying the time of birth.
It's not fighting against newborns at this time.
When they grow up, they can take their own decisions related to their body.
But St. Erlen Bartz of Petersburg, Dr. Erlen Barz, a daughter who helps hundreds of others in support group, said that the law of Germany will give both parents and children "power."
twelvetyji's daughter was born with property, but she was called D.S.D.
Because her intelligence was wrong in the area, so the woman's intelligence was developing in Kati.
His body has Jenny, but there are no abortions or dysfunctions.
Now 29-year-old Katy is married, and child psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she's drunk, she hopes to be a mother through the shot or by a hostel survey.
And said, "This is the law for parents, that they may not make their own decision."
It provides them with the right way to understand and time by some experiments before writing, 'man' or 'man'.
In this manner, you stay well - cultivate the baby, love the child.
You have a dear child and enjoy him.
We don't have to do any kind of surgery in Dubai that can't be returned.
They said, "It brings children up in the process of making decisions, and the parents are free of fear that they may do so."
Finally, the child will determine which sex he is more easily -- and that's very good.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.

The report: Bedden Duping Obama for Hillary Clayton.
According to New York Times, nearly half of President Brak Obama’s president, he quietly considered Hillary Clinton at the position of President Hillary Clayton on the Presidential Board for 2012.
The mystery is one of the most remarkable shots that Mark Haiferen and John Helman were expected to receive a strong 2012 campaign to change the game, "Dable Down: Change the Game 2012."
Times received a copy of the firemi book, and on Thursday evening, the president’s top counselor said that Obama’s election could again help to determine whether to hold the president's top followers and delay polling in 2011.
According to Time’s National Political Journalist Jonathan Martin, the book refers to the entire effort of the main authorities and the key bill of the White House for the name of the East White House, which affects the steppes of the East Kingdom.
Possible switch was a very safe secret within the base of the Chicago Act and within the Oval Office.
With nearly half the president's attention, the former Obama Prime Minister Jim Macina, and former president of the White House, David Axlerod and David Palupif, was well aware of the change.
The "Bal Down" claims that Bedden tried to change his personal decision, but before the end of his decision, it will not be better for Obama's situation from the hotel of Clayton before he finally made his personal decision.
In a interview with Martin, Dawah has confirmed that the administration was actually thinking about the place with Bradton.
"I looked into the whole scene, and one of them said to the newspaper."
Do you remember that when the president was at that time in danger, we were in such a state, saying, "Holy Christ, what shall we do?"
While Thée said as "terrorist", Martin told the CNN's Anders Cooper that the election campaign would again make important investments on how much it would cost to find it.
"The votes and focusing groups don't spend as seriously as they're thinking about something," Martin said at Es360.
It's weird, Halaki, who knew Obama's team was looking for a change.
Martin told CNN that they had asked if their boss knew about the possible change.
Although Dadha said that the president didn't think he was aware of possible changes", former Chief of Steffy admitted that it was "the chance" that Obama knew.
"The World Down" Of course not to answer: wouldn't it be possible to check on Obama's desk? Martin added more.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama was not aware of the billing ticket analysis.
"Perhaps," Martin said.
Glow-in-the-Dake ice cream likes?
A British Prime Minister has created the world's first-in-the-Dor ice cream - using prison.
Charlie Francis has made great use of sea creatures to develop the best breakfast.
He came to the idea that after reading a research letter on the Jaffishi, and the most reliable scientists in China used chemical light to produce proteins.
The ice cream, that's eating the tongue, will increase the PHT levels of protein and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says that ice cream is warm with the heat of the mouth, that is more productive than you would like to win.
Lik I'm the president of M. Dalesis ice cream company said: "This is an incredible thing, but it's an incredible thing, but the early product of the early days will have about 2 grams of about 2 grams."
The protein that we're using in ice cream will react to the tongue with the nuclear PH.
As the face grows warm, the protein PH will increase and the ice cream will shine.

Even though I tastes very good.
Apne is known for unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, meat, and gold.
But his next creation must be more critical.
He said: "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is impossible because of ice crystal that makes ice cream rise over ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
The ice cream is useful for the opposite quality of a prison, which is connected by Chinese scientists.

George Kirwin: Uror Wiggton gave the option to Scotts
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we are warned that independent Scotland will need to be involved in the terms of the E.U.S.'s membership as a set of independent travel zone in Europe.
At Brooklyn, the passport control points to stories about the limits of the paintings on the walls of Hadrian.
The truth is that the stathlicide paper described the possible economic benefits of freedom with the rest of Europe, although not described in pre -Handlines.
No one described the E.U. members use their time to change their basic rules according to their needs.
Because Scotland is no longer a zone, so Brazil will be allowed to get away with non-operative bridges instead of obtaining anything from Scotland.
So, then, A-Kanni.
And the thing that has been so long, she has come. First of all, I've heard the "Pioneer Control" news reports about the passport control about 40 years ago.
Still, the interesting point for this fascinating old story to be heard again.
Why should freedom from Scotland expect Europe to flag?
Why is the cross-vess of London's work for Brucees, especially now?
Here is a real European news: The great, war-stop plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, the project is officially dead.
The dedicated groups are getting stronger to resist or to close Euro as a similar currency in the whole EU.
Even in Germany, urostic al-Qattechnative forr General Party, which has been established this year - suddenly received nearly half a million votes in September, and thus the free demographics (the equivalent of our Liberation dealt with our Liberation).
The plan to create the United Europe is always against domestic violence.
The current economic crisis, however, proved to be a fundamental change.
In addition to the harsh rules made by Berlin and European Central Bank, many people have to think that the project has been far away from Europe.
There was no greater role in the loss of Euro's crisis in the biggest budget of the national governments - such was the only truth in Greece.
Rather, the Euro System established its members to seal the Exchange rate on German exports - things that would want to keep German politics.
Without the possibility of losing domestic currency, South Europe finds itself in a potentially harmful state of production in comparison with Germany.
The only solution is to reduce Vietnam and public abuse - which is encouraged by Berlin.
On the current budget and currency problems, high European producers have a serious European product.
In order to release the French and German energy forces on the use of users - the "light" power policies, European companies pay four times for electricity and gas.
This is the loss of the target, which we've already seen in Grangmuth.
Even in the world, Europe can't save the European PetroCals industry from being affected by S.S. Shell gas.
As a result, the spirit of rebellion has stirred in people, especially in France, who was ever the main fan of E.U.
After Greece, the top politicians of France saw the EU to control Germany, and Paris had been able to provide Billion in the world as a way to provide the Billing Plan of the World.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has applied its own financial policies on Europe, which has caused France to collapse.
The result is that the South African National Front recently won the Soviet Union in the third position.

If, as most possible, the E.U.O.S. groups display good manners in these elections, this kind of tag can affect the European Association first time.
My view is: soon the E.U.S. will end with the anti-corruption of the anti-corruption and the anti-corruption spirit in Europe.
Yuro will not end completely, but it will break and return to Europe like "The Nation of Nations" in some way that will support General Die Galol.
Germany and some of its privatizations can keep Euro, but France and South Europe will resume their currency.
I hope that the UK will keep you away from this project with the U.S.
However, the growth growth of heirton in Palestine in Palestine indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all?
We can choose to stay in the area of Little England (usually definitely).
Or we can defend our own financial interests - which includes telling Berlin and Bruce to separate themselves at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in the European system, but I hope we keep our own votes.
It will be easier to work together with other similar thinking countries in Europe in non- Gentile countries.
Otherwise we should think about keeping our financial freedom in the way of Norway as we walk.
In Scotland, S.N.P. - Government has been successful in Europe - the most successful Communist political campaign in Europe, which proposed by Charles Elister Darling of Lebanon, and after that, during the 2011 year, the auto-liberation support of the Tory-Demgen was remarkable.

Should a mother be concerned if the development and development of breast - feeding should begin at the age of 7 or 8 years of age?
This week, in the United States, U.S. Child Medicine Center at the U.S. Child Health Conference in Florida, U.S.A., observed that the initial physical changes in American women are common in the United States.
“I spend a lot of time putting into trust that this is usually not a direct result of the rapid progress of the entire biodiversity."
The actual symptoms of development, such as the formation of cells, the hair and hair of the skin and the flesh of the hair of the skin are already seen in girls.
But during the last four decades, there has been a dramatic change in the lives of the traditional journals.
In United States, average age 12.5, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"When breast-feeding begins to develop at least two years in the first round show, the capsules say, "Time-first-time: necessary to deal with this problem."
It's time for Yvonne's development.
What's the start of Yvoven, but when the breast grows with breast development before eight years of age, it's called "bal-dive".
In most cases this process will slow or stop - which the child doctor can carefully observe.
In the case of more rapid progress, anastrologers may need to examine the possibility of serious problems, such as the Times or the Society.
Time-old journals and other effects are treated to delay delay: the time-old age-dimensity, which may lead to unintended growth and old age.
Companies for drugs or hormone treatment depend on child age, development rate, growth rate, and emotional growth.
Mental aspects are also important.
Caploitous drugs are about drugs but accept, "Worlding can contribute practical points, and girls may feel different from those with them."
Another big problem may be considered: the parent doesn't want the daughter of their younger daughter to be treated.
He said, "They worry about the risks of pregnancy or how to keep them clean."

Caploquists determines the law that its most important cause is the punishment of stability.
He helped study with girls between 6 and 9 years of age in 2001, which adds to the weight of the body’s growth time.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Spanish girls are motivated to get their early boyfriends before they get married.
There's a lot of explanation.
On the global level, the image of time-prefecture, from economic conditions to weather and genes, appears to affect everything.
Other points: While children are getting the hair of the face and the age of the genigitia, but completely unexplained girls are not as clear as the girls are.
Other doctors who attend the AAPH conference supported the topic’s complicatedness.
Even to the children, and to the young children, and to the children's hair, is a common sight.
“ We need to be careful about how we identify the real beginning of the universe, ” says Dr. Lawrence Silverman at the Gorlieb Children’s Hospital in New Jersey."

The debate for the seat’s width on the Great Ordinary Day of the jet producers.
There has been a struggle for the 2nd month to fight for Asshurdo, between the long-term flights of the East Air Forces for long-term flights.
The debate is focused on the width of the Economy class of long flights in the Economy class, not always given by Erlines, but by the site of which the host has claimed to be the key.
EARBS is expected to have a wide range of 18 inches (64 cm) in Economy this week, but it should be determined by its main standard.
The argument between the plane designers comes in when the possibility of selling the large aircraft’s long - distance plane after the event was 17-21.
How's the previous category of planes created-- especially if the setting is 9 or 10 is less than 10 is being developed with the design of Minni Jacob Zeits in mind?
It's created "777 X" which will place a total of 176 people in 17 inches and 10 in a row.
The Airbes says it's going to take 350 people left 18 in 18 inches.
The plane Dengage often beats business affairs through advertising in business press.
Now, with the Airbes 777 X, there's the hope of making more than 100 Air Forces on May 100, this is calling for the next public.
It's recently seen that anything that has been happening in the beginning of the war has been shown to Finsho, is it going to be a restaurant three together with you?
The Airbes Bis sales chief John Lei is also offering long- distance flights from the Boing Region Turbo."
As a change, people are getting better, but the plane doesn't change the way it is.
According to statistics from the United States Health Department, by the 1970 ’ s, Boing 747 Zebo was defined as a modern - day bicycle trip, and I am the average 40 - 49 - year - old American male, whose weight increased by 10 percent.

Erebes says that it has been hit by a seat in 1950 when the name “Jet Set ” was the average member of the average center.
Airbes says that they have established a research staff that suggests an additional 53 inches of sleep in the width of the seat's width.
Boeing argued on the side of the Erebus’s seat measure, and said that this does not depend on the decision of the maker how the Irish trades and tools become balanced.
It also says that the research shows depend on the experience of more than the width of a seat.
"It actually shows what they really want to do to provide the airlines and the things they believe they need to succeed."
"They don't want to tell us what they have to do."
They know better their business than anyone else.
It's about the cervix room for the Flyers, but it's a fast point for the investigators that it can affect the IS.
In the decades following this debate, the commercial trade of at least 700 billion dollars is estimated to be at least 700 billion dollars in airports and European exports, sufficient enough to tap into the US U.S. and European export.
The first time the site was reported in July, which is actually a conflict between new jet planes.
Airbes and Boeing claimed that 20 percent of the seats have been committed in their new partnership in Enenine design, compared to 365-Cit Boing 777-300 Air.
The figure of Boing depends on the contrast between the 777 x - 9 original design.
10 is now used as a comparison with the advantage of the unit price.
Kevin Kenstein, Europe's Airbean, says, "It's going to take control of our planes, along with our products, more and more seats."
On the other hand, the analysts say that the whole 10-Citt-line cable has suggested that many passengers are on the side of the Danner Leout, who can go along with Steale.
The cabin expert, my career, and editor's daughter-in-law, said by the Internet, "Autrah will be very good for the seat's feet wide, but the fact is that it's the business proposal of the Easter proposal of 777"
Airbes and Boeing seats do not endorse but provide a list of agents for the Airlines.
The jet vendor around the world will also be careful to check these layouts.
More comfortable, all buildings are also providing high-levels for flight services and local travel.
It's not a 10-350, but it's not yet useless.
But recently, as far as Erebes did, some of its jet planes were emphasised on some of its massive cabin seats to need more carbon facilities.
A new project flying on a standdder without support from modern jet planes is not possible, but it can be turned away from the block of 77 X sales.
A new anti-Nineine vaccine can end the joy of smoking.
Scientists have developed an anti-nicine vaccine that can end the fun of smoking.
One of the cells of the Vatican was able to protect the rats for a whole lifetime of life.
A further test of man is needed before the investigation starts, which may take years, but in New York, Rondville Medical College, Professor Ronald Crystal of New York, said that there are positive points that are positive.
Professor Cornel said that this kind of vaccine can finally help millions of people who have tried to quit all forms of smoking in the market today, but they found that Nikot, their current power is far more powerful than those of them."
The new vaccine is a harmful virus that has been prepared to bring genetic information from the intention of producing anti-nicant antibody.
It is the virus, selectedly infected by the virus, which begins to form a permanent drop of antibidz.
The antibidz search for any antibiotics in blood, and prevents smoking from rising inside the pipe before they reach the brain before they reach the brain.
In a test, the vaccines that were later given Nikotton, they performed their normal actions.
Researchers say, but the rat that was not given the vaccine was "good," it was a sign that Nikotton had reached his brain.
This was used in the Spanish transliteration medical journal.
The former tobacco vaccine has failed because they were antibiodus.
There was to be a regular interval, to make antibiodus levels, but it proved to be expensive and unsatisfactory.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be very high, because the Yayde will make the cell the factory of antibody.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human oxygen remains completely safe, it can be given to children before the desire to smoke, so that they can be saved from nicotine's addiction.
But it may be used to quit smoking by people who smoke.
He said, "They will know that if they start smoking again, they will find no joy in smoking because of nicotine’s addiction, which can help them to save their habit."
British scientists pointed out the results, but there was a warning of the need for more research.

The British government has announced the study to increase the benefits of Scotland by the HS2 railway project.
The work by HS2 is broadcasting high speed services in northern Scotland and England, which will soon begin with the first step in 2026.
Transport minister Baronez Kramer told the project that it would be one of the "Brits."
Smith Brown, a traveling minister of Scotland, said that they are very "transgressive" by working with the British government on this project.
First step will include the new high speed line between London and West Midlands.
When the second step is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Lids.
In June, the government measured the cost of high speed link between London and North England by measuring from £32.7 Bian.6.6 B.C.E.
The British government, who was talking to Scotland, directed the HS2 Limidt to consider the possibility of furthering the possibility of railway skills and travel for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a possible trip from Golasgo and Edinberg to London for three hours or less.
According to Barons Kramer, "Our goal is to bring the real national network closer to the UK and its cities."
We're moving along with HS2, because its benefits will be too much.
Without it we will face problems related to the ability of our train network.
But it's also about the connection between 18 British cities with Glasgo and Edinberg, which will be closely connected because of HS2.
According to Scott secretary Elistry Carmic, "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scott Brown government, Mr. Carmic called back the "stut" of Scotland from the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The chance of the high speed of the railway is to make Scotland a lot of financial profit, but it will also raise financial burden on Scotland in the whole of Britain.
So we are excited to work in the British government's shareivator, so that we can test the options for all to create the high speed in Scotland and complete the benefits of the Glasgo-Adenberg line, which is already being planned.
The next year, I'm ready to review the report with the British government's ministers and decide together on the next step.

Citizen plane security authorities also said that she was thinking about the announcement, but emphasized that in Australia the use of electronic devices is still under control in the main stage of flying devices.
"Now, with CASA, there is no specific design to control the software in the plane." The official said, "This is the issue of the plane service system, according to which the aircraft service systems have always been fully established, and the security system has always been controlled by the crew."
Virginia who is already communicating with CASA about the use of his in-fifty-free entertainment system is already in touch with CASA, but he asked for to follow this change on the guidance of Vietnam.
"We will welcome reviews by CASA in the case of the use of electricity tools, because it really seems that this will provide better experience for customers, because we have (Wires In-Floitism) in our planes.
Quentas said that it would follow the current rules now.
He said, "We can't use air tools during our current policy, and we don't have to change it."
FAA decision, applies to American Ellines.
Thus, we always have a taste in the entertainment development that can benefit passengers, and we will be sure to think about the decision and reasons behind the FA.
The effect of this decision will be different on every US Air Service Company and will depend on their planes.
Air service companies will need to confirm that their plane mobile devices can endure radio abuses, as well as their rules, training material, car-on-on-Beagger programs, and a brief explanation.
FA said, "After the authorization of their plane by the Airlines, he will allow the passengers to use the light weight device, such as the light weight device, the Eberders, and smartphone."
In low-speech case, the driver will direct the crew to shut down your device while the plane is down.
The group has also suggested to keep heavy equipment under seat or in upper levels during the flight and down the plane.

After that, the accused sold the land into millions of dollars.
There, they took iron on the paper.
Then the real owner of the land was to be eaten by police and administration.
The charges made by the Jail registration were prominently focused on the lands of the ARAG.
Because there is no one to manage the land of the NRAG.
So it's easy to sell those lands to buy them.
The police commissioner Gill told the charges that they had already made nearly 150 jurists.
According to the police, there are already cases of fraud and theft against the group's general body.
The explosion of bomb blasts in Bali
In 2002, 202 people and relatives who were killed by bomb blasted 202 were shouting at the bomb blaster, shouting that Amarak should face the firing team.
Tacock, who spent nearly 10 years as a part of the most interested people in South-East Asia, was told 20 years of his role in building the explosive device in the bomb blast.
He could be released in 15 years when he was released.
45-year-old Umura, a 45-year-old leading tourist area, was attacked by two armed killers, including 202, including 85 Australians, and many were injured.
He was also found guilty of several other accusations related to terrorism, including the series of horrors held in the Church in Indonesia on the East Christmas Eve in 2000.
The organizers asked for life's death, even though they could ask for a bomb that was known as "social man" as the master of the bomb.
The decision resurfaced the painful memories of the female June cartoon who lost their 39-year-old daughters in the disaster attack a decade ago and its partners.
He stopped his neighbors and said that he should be put to death.
I really feel that he should be punished like other terrorists.
Mrs. Courtney said to APP, "He must be standing before the firing team."
Every day I have to live without my mother's law, and without my daughters.
On October 12, 2002, after 11 o'clock in the night, the name of this club was lost after the explosion of the bomb that was loaded outside the camp.
Peter Hagues was in the padddle bar during the blast of the explosions by the suicide attacks.
As a result of this explosion, they went to a month long and three times their "dead death" during living on the living devices.
Mr. Hagues says that the Tachak should have been the same destination that three other members of the Jamimer Jamimer Jamaimatah inner team had met - Amiroji, Shamas, and Emmemet, four years ago.
Actually, this person should be put to death before anyone else.
Behold, there is no reason to keep it.
After 202 killing and killing many people, 20-year-olds are not enough.
Tuki, the last person to get out of the child bomb blasts.
He survived for nearly a decade, but eventually in January 2011, Pakistan was arrested in Attabad, where the U.S. army of former Alisam bin Laden was shot down after four months.
During the trial, F.B.A. agents presented evidence that the report was in Pakistan in an attempt to restore contact between South-East Asian terrorist groups and Alaska.
"She didn't surrender."
Even today, he doesn't really hurt so many people.
The decision came before the 10th year of attack, which will be marked by events in Bali and Australia.
Mrs. Courtin said, "This year there will be tears."
Still can still appeal against his punishment.
F.A.: Airlines can now use gastrates in air (can not call via cell phone)
From entering the Airlines gate to reading out of the gate, working, playing games, watching music, and listening to music - but not speaking with your cellphones - this is the most pre-superative approach to the new channel.
But the passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference in F.A. Michael Hartta said how fast these changes are being handled, it will be different in every aspect of the airport.
The AFA will have to show how their plane, new direction, and the training of members of their team members to represent the instructions and services of their team members.
F.A.A. said that it has already taken some of the plans from the Airlines to expand the use of the portal electronic device on the plane.
Delta and Zetblue are among those who have already presented plans.
In a statement, F.A. said, " Based on the location of the design, we can accept the extended use of electronic devices very quickly.
Meanwhile, passengers need to close their smartphones, telelets, and other devices when the plane's door is closed.
They are expected to reach 10,000 feet of the plane's height and not be allowed by Captain.
The passengers are expected to turn off their device when the plane is down, and do not continue until the plane is completely off.
F.A. said, within new direction-references that are completely safe from air pollution, they can allow their passengers to use the plane, fly off the plane, fly off the plane, and use the device time time for telecommunication.
Most new Airline companies and other planes that have been modified in this way are expected to meet these values.
Laura Golding has welcomed these changes.
Glading says, "When the rules are safe, we'll work together with the Airlines companies.
When this point comes, we're like "Holol mannaers" - they're warm.
Eggsy said that but it would still be forbidden to connect Internet access to at least 10,000 feet high, saving e-mail, sending messages, or download data.
The passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, telelets, and other devices in the application mode.
So there will still be no discussion with friends, such as online Scabbel, which is the famous event that was related to the event that was the last time the agent Albert Baldwin was playing on his smartphone during the year 2011, while he was forbidden to shut down the device, and the American Airlines removed the plane from the plane.
And there must still be a collection of heavy devices such as laptops, because they will be concerned about the other person in the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be blocked during the flight.
The insurance rights agency related to the phone calls is near the organization communication agency, not with F.A.
F.A. can block some electronic devices during flight and down the plane.
Last month, Mark Rosen of the National Transport Security Council, who is the national security expert for the C.B.S. News Security expert, said that cell phone is still considered to be a threat.
Every day he said, "Sel phones are really serious issues, not just because they can create addiction in the navigation-related device, but because they can also create addiction to cell phones when they're in the air."
In order to examine this point, the chairman of the G.A.A. committee has concluded that the government should allow the government to use more personal electronic devices for the past month.
In recent years, pressure has increased in recent years to reduce the use of the F.A.
C. Clare McKick, such as D-M, has said there is no valid security reason for judgment.
It's becoming more difficult to control these restrictions because the device's use is universal.
Some studies also indicate that nearly three third passengers forget or ignore the instructions to stop their device.
F.A. began to ban using electronic devices in 1996 when traffickers received a report on the role of the F.M. radio and communication devices to take up the world's media and media.
New Airlines companies, more depend on the electronic system than the previous generation of planes, but they too have been designed and approved to resist electronic intervention by F.A.
Airlines have been using y-Fai on the crossing height for many years.
The planes modified for the Y-Fi system are even more hostile to the abuses.
Huttar said that most Airlines companies should come up with the right values to use for the latest electronic devices in the new direction-reference device.
Today's electronic device, the last generation's electronic device, generates a lot of power transmissions than the previous generation's electronic device.
For example, E-reeders, for example, is a complete transition to the page.
But the transactions present when we download or send data via the device.
The device used by passengers was also using the device to reduce the ban, including Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company's authorities loaded his entire Grand E-Riders in the Airlines and dragged him to test the problems but no problem was found.
FF.A. recommended the presence of the match-partial feelings of the risk of using the device.
During the National Air Force Association, Douglas Kid said that the drug abuse from the device is real, even if it is the risk name.
Other committee members said that only pilots were described in support of the device in support of the device in the Aircraft System, most of them are older than old.
However, the committee members of the committee allowed the F.A. pilot to order the passengers to stop the device when the plane was down in less detail.
Travel workers have welcomed changes and they have also had the general knowledge of people traveling to the latest visit of the project.
C.C.O.R.A.A.D. said that we are happy that the F.A. has recognized that traveling with joy is not impossible with the rescue, protection and security.

Is Europe’s top class ready to business with Britain?
In April the business was launched and promised to bring the business together and determine what changes in U.S. daily and rich production of e.U.
For him, we were the biggest and most extensive surveyors of Britain's commercial leaders, asking them what they thought about the British business.
U-gave has thought of 1,000 business leaders, who represent the business shape, areas and places in Britain.
The conclusion of this survey may be surprising for many people.
We found that a large part of business wants to export out of Europe now, and want to focus on the countries that are becoming modern and increasing, while E.U.S. members are being aggressive.
They want the government to focus on new business relationships with nations such as China, India and Brazil, not on the long-term and far-off process of reforming the secret institutions of E.U.
When asked their ideas about specific policy fields, such as the law from a copyright mirror, the majority of the business leaders believed they should come back to Westminster.
The common exception could be seen easily, businessmen say that the price of the Vince of Brazil’s Winnium, Europe’s commercial territory, is far more than the benefits of being part of a major business area — even the largest businesses that were formerly known as European companies, 40 percent agreed on this.
Finally and most clearly, our survey of business leaders, found that a large part of Britain wants clearly to proceed on the road rather than on politics.
This conclusion, which was seen in the levels of major business groups, pointed out that business companies are inspired by a "critical change", which gave the UK power back its lost power.
It's a high price - for Britain and for finding a better deal, 16 percent in the U.S. have changed the issue of living in the EU.
The prime minister should not be in doubt: This survey shows that Britain’s business, E.U, supports their plans to publish the terms of the subscribers in Britain.
It also pointed out that businessmen expect a positive change in balance to the current power balance of U.K.
A better deal for British businesses is possible, and it is soon necessary, because it is moving forward in the direction of Eurojan, relevant economic and political organization.
The priority must be to be servants and increase in Britain, as our survey shows, that this means that it means a new trade change in business and in a new trade operation.

Before the charges against Jonathan Lord, Y.C.A.'s two employees have heard the charges against the two employees, the Royal Commission.
In 2011, before the carringbaby child charge worker Jonathan Lord was charged with crimes against the U.M.C.R.R.R.B.R.B.B., two of his employees were charged with criminal crimes.
But in his statement, Ayog said that it was “not even in the case of child abuse within his organization”, it was told Aeg.
The chief officer Philippe Green was asked about the case against the case that was allegedly charged with the BM.C.H.R.R.H.C.H.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.A.B.A.B.A.A. in exchange for the crimes against the children who were being cared for in the United States in 1991.
Mr. Har said they knew about the first case, but they didn't know about the other case.
He also acknowledged that the event's equivalent is YM.C.C.A.'s statement that "V.C.C.A. has been checked and that he has found the most ahead of the VMC.C.C. security case."
The company of Ayog is proof that YMC.A was denied, and this year it received four potentially lower ratings in the community divisional ratings in August.
Mr. Green who is connected to the age of 21-year-old Y.C.A, admitted that "the system has failed to set up the Lord" system, and failed to make sure that employees were fully informed of their rights regarding providing information about child security rules.
In the beginning of this year, Lloyd was convicted for crimes with 12 children during the two years of the two-year-old period.
He was sentenced to cancer for at least six years.
But Mr. Green refused the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in V.M.C.A, which caused workers not to inform the child security breach by Lord Lord.
The workers gave the Witnesses what they saw about the violations that the Lord gave to the Witnesses to spend time with children, to keep them private, to sit down in front of them, to tell them that he loves them and that he loves them to play on his mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was in charge of Loder, and he was concerned about child security training because he was concerned about his behavior, he testified that the L.M.C.C.C.B.C.B.B.B.A.B.B.A.B.B.B.A.B.A.B.A. was the "C.C.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.B.A.A.C.'s service director for most of the time."
CEO said he didn't accept the witness of workers that they were not easy to give instructions above their arrangement.
He said, along with his girlfriend, his friends have misled his decision to inform him of his decision.
M. Har said that he provided his views on the V.C.A.S.db. Mandel, for "noting information" from the United Nations organization.
Mr. Har said that soon after the trial, the decision to sign the secret agreement was made by the workers, the decision was made by Y.M.C.C.C.'s Child Service by the Child Law.
He was supposed to be saved from the witness, but it was not "good" and not properly executed.
Special Professor Stephen Schulman of Griffith University said that during the year 2099, Jonathan Lord's work between the year 2014 and 2011, there was no safe organization.
He said there were “many problems ” in the assignment of workers, training, training, and training.

Scientists have put light on the matter, and light on the matter of the dog's actions and of his forehead.
The previous researchers know that the happy dogs move their double to the south (with the eye of the dog), while the Bechin dogs move their tail to the left.
But scientists now say that partners can recognize this genetic mystery of the dog's tail and respond to it.
This study has been published in Journal County Bileji.
The New Encyclopædia Britannica from Toronto stated: “All of this is well known to the left and right part of the brain’s body in encouraging that a positive or negative feelings develop."
We've also tried to see it in other nations.
He explained that in dogs, the right part of the brain was responsible for the works of the left hand and the opposite order, and the two bullets played a different role in feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to a single blast by other dogs, researchers have watched other dogs watch the animals.
They measured the hearts of petot dogs and understood their behavior.
We probably don't have much time to understand why they sometimes move on the other side.
“We presented dogs with dogs in movies of dogs – in the photograph to deal with other issues in a realistic version, and we could see the evil of the past, and the worse, and the left or the right to the right to the left."
And when the beasts saw a strange dog moving toward the east, they were very quiet.
But when they turned their tail toward the left side of the dog, their heart was lifted, and they saw it.
According to Dr. Valentera, they don't think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these acts.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience about what they should be concerned about and not on whom.
He said: "If you've met other dogs many times, and if they move your back, it's related to a more friendly manner, and the right part offers less friends, you respond to the same experience."
Researchers say that these conclusions can provide better information about the feelings of the animals, the owners, the animals, and the teachers.
John Bradsh, professor of the University of British School of Veterer Science, explained that the first study is not the left or right part of dogs.
Last year, the team of university of Lincoln found that when dogs see a strange dog, they turn their heads towards the left and turn their heads toward the happy dog.
In other researchs in Canada, the University of Victoria, said: "The opposite of the other study is when the robots were forced to move to the left of the dog, instead of selling dogs."
He said it was because it was because it was because dogs in various studies did not fully understand animals or robots in movies.
He explained that it can help the study of how to respond to real dogs by dogs.
"Since various scientists have found enough evidence that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more information is still available - and there are no dogs in this case."
However, it seems that the way they behave is easy to see that we probably don't have much time to think about why they sometimes move on the other side.
Alex Turner’s disease prevented Glasgo Gig
Rock Bank, named Arctic Manquisse, has released Gig in Galasgo after he's yellow from his main singer's neck.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February.
The Vatican announced that Pope Francis would first make a new cardinal of the Catholic Church in his work on February 22th.
Cartonins, the top class of the Catholic Church, are only priests, they only choose the pope, so Frances will determine the first group of their people who will eventually be able to choose their successor.
There's a total of 201 cardinals right now.
Thus, after he reached 80 years of age, the cardinal was not allowed to participate in the pope's election - it comes in 120 "carnal elector".
According to the news, the Vatican's prime minister Fedicro Lombardy said that before the new Cardines will be held, all present can be held at the meeting, which is called Pop-sa.
Lombardi said, "Pap Frances has decided to make his decision to hold the pope's pope in February to make it easier to plan for other meetings of the world to participate in."
Jack Valerro, of the Catholic Wars, said that the chances of getting less than the number of cardinals by February were due to lack of chance.
He usually reported that the pope’s number is less than 120, as far as the number of cardinals, and the name of older cardinals who are more than 80 years old, according to their wishes.
Valerio said that the next year, the pope would be important because this year, after the election of France, will be the first president.
Currently there is a kind of prevalence to Europe and especially to Italy.
He said, "It must be exciting to see if the new Pope, even from the rest of the world, has to make balance.
In South America, 40 percent of Roman Catholics are Roman Catholics, but their number is very small.
Francis, a member of the Council of Cardins, which is a group of eight cardinals around the world, who have to look for ways to improve the church’s methods, will also be the first to be selected after it has been removed.
Before this, Pope decided to decide for himself all things.
He said, "But Frances chose these eight cardinals to help him."
He's asking for advice from French cardinals.
But we're not in this situation before -- it's totally new.
Valerio said that the bishops usually rank the bishops of large places, but Frances were about to surprise us so we don't know who they're talking about."

OBMA’S Democratic Republic of Congo
I gave Obama twice to expect change.
They say that Obama's great efforts have been restricted because of the policy of G.O.P.
The advice of Oberamai’s website can’t cure drone attacks
OBMA, 2008 Memorial attendance reminds us of what could happen
Nathaniel P. Morse is a second year-old student at Harvard Medical School.
I've been reading very painful books today.
It is a book about which I think it will motivate me during the second year of medical school and give me hope.
It's called "the courage to win," and it's the 2008 President of Obama's election campaign.
When I beat my patients in the night and go to bed, this book takes me in a period of time that the political motivated millions of people and could hold your breath.
The election was confirmed, and news speakers were allowed to show the historical significance of that time.
The eyes of my friends were tears of joy, and my parents saved the news that they met.
A group of young distant people were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
In 2008, they had 82 percent of approval ratings while becoming the president of Obama.
And I gave the Book to those who read it,
The truth of the present is a hard truth, like to return from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days - they miss a distance, a painful memory of past times.
It really changed after I first voted for the first time.
Simply saying no one would ever think of it.
I give Obama many awards, from the Federal Cage Act to our army back from Iraq, "Don't ask, "Don't tell us until Osama bin Laden is killed."
Besides, I believe that the policy of opposing prejudice has prevented many efforts to advance our country: the public options for African reform, health service, the public option, to shut down on Goano Bay, more than, and more.
But many times I take sides with fellow workers and Obama administration, and I have to end the answer that I can give them.
I've reached the point of political disappointment.
The policy against Repblin is not a response to foreign leaders, nor is the answer to drone attacks on children in foreign countries.
It cannot answer data about the personal life of ordinary American citizens by National Security Agency, nor can it answer the government’s bad actions.
This is not due to the murder of American citizens without a vaccine, nor is it less than public rights and tax limits during the President's camp.
It can't answer the results of the report, which says that the hard-to-dodry attempts to silence Mado have been the biggest "consolations since the Ninxin administration."
And most recently, it can't give a simple website to design an easy website after three years of being signed in the order of the Federal Care Act.
I don't know what I expected.
If, in the age of 18, I had to guess that the regime system could break down the political campaign that brought it forward.
Apparently, the unpredictable office is not a prerequisite path, since opposition political parties and popular events will provide the size of our public discussion.
Nevertheless, the examples I have mentioned above seem to be most popular by the administration.
That's the most troubling thing to you.
I re voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his expectations.
The final Romans presented an open and unexplained option that did not appear to determine their values or their position.
I thought there would be another work for Obama that will be free from the pressures of the future.
However, while Obama's presentation is less than 45 percent of this week, it has become very difficult to return through that book in 2008.
Seeing him, I remember the things that have gone missing.
One part of the book was reading this week, which described how the Pennsylvania Prime Minister had a serious loss.
At a post-maram Campan meeting, they told their servants that they needed to return to the bar, and that their purposes must be true.
He said, "I want to get back to my count."
We should remember who we are.'
I can't agree with you more than five years later, Mr. President.
The ideas expressed in this comment are the Nethanol Morse.

They said: "We are rich in history that we can serve the community at this important time."
That's why the critics had to deal with.

It's the wealth of which is connected to honor.
How great is the man who is rich, who can't enjoy it properly, nor have any other work?
Let no man deprive him of his wealth.

Traveling from the soil, rivers, and forests to provide medical services
Dr. Georges Val, a free health service in rural areas in Cameroon
The vine and its crew are watching hundreds of diseases every week
In West African countries there are not much medical doctors; only a medical doctor for 5,000 people
Give your vote here or through your mobile.
Dr. Georges Vale is one of the ten officials at the top of the CNN.N.
You can vote for them or anyone else for them or for someone else at the CNN.N.N. to make the year's successor.
The winner will get $50,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George Wells visited his sick father and had seen the hospital, feeling helpless, who had not done well to help them.
Jamal Vale was killed in 1981 in an accident near Yandai, the capital of Cameroon.
At first they had only broken their hands, but an infection spread to their brain, and he created blood clots that affected the rest of their lives.
Georges Well says, "There wasn't any neuroscientist in Cameroon."
If we had money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, he took his father and a large crowd of many people to the clinics and hospitals, and he was able to obtain any treatment.
He said: "This is no easy thing.
You get out of the house at 5:00 p.m. that hope you'll be the first person to reach the hospital, but it doesn't happen.
There are many diseases there.
Some can wait and fall in the mouth of death.
Not much changes have been made since Val's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon for every 5000 people.
If you compare, there is a doctor for every 413 people in the United States.
And if there be a physician there, many of Cameroon's inhabitants can't afford it.
Two of the five who live in the land live under the poor line, and about two thirds of the abuses of health services in the country.
Well says, "They're the only problem with poverty."
And because of poverty they cannot enjoy their life.
And when he saw the affliction of his father, and the affliction of his kindred, he determined to make an end of it.
Dr. Georges and their crew of volunteers have been treated for the past 700 free medical treatment.
They also became a medical doctor, and working as a witness at the Central Hospital in Yondun.
And he started the non-laup organization Escoyim, who went to rural areas to provide free medical services.
For 2008, they and their volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday they sit in the van and about 30 people, they bind medical agents from the roof, and go to rural areas where people need medical care.
Sometimes it doesn't even happen to them.
They have to pass through rivers and dust more than once.
But when they arrive, they receive a real privilege: wedding, singing, and dancing with the community.
The free medical service in these villages is actually a reason to be grateful, and the vanilla - including its big smiles and non-canny energy - it includes joy-chush.
The next morning, their team begins to meet with hundreds of diseases.
He said, "We're meeting 500 people each trip."
They come from the village about 60 miles [60 km], and they come to Paddle.
All week, they provide a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, acupuncture, diabetes, bacteria, parasites, and genetics.
Others can get a beak, a donation or a free certificate -- the need for this document goes to school but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team makes simple exercise with local terms.
The operations are usually performed at school, Town Hall, or house; after the process, the patient goes to the safe place, and makes a place for the next person.
The group's generator publishs in room and satelliteing devices, and works on their own Sundays.
It's too slow, but the village musicians usually help the team to keep the team.
He said, "They play games all night to keep us alive and continue their work."
Sunday their team returns back to the city, they get tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group, including Cameroon's medical student and foreign medical students, has been a medical doctor last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those who help them.
One man said that because of receiving free heart surgery, she would be able to go back to work.
He said, “This is my wife, and my family.”
In addition to running clinics and working as a professional-chicant at the hospital and working as a professional-school student at the hospital, at night working in private medical clinics around Yunandi.
He told them that it is their second job that contributes to 60% of their non-profit work; the rest of the collection is fulfilled in private contributions.
"I don't know when they sleep."
They're always in the hospital, or they're trying to earn money for their organization to keep them running.
This is an outstanding opportunity for those who come from the United States and Europe to be involved in O'Malley's campaign to join the Waldenses and the United States, which they can never get in their country.
O'Malley said, "We help Dr. Vale to get the tools and clean the blood pressure, and we are capable of obtaining practical experience."
As a second-year-old medical student in America, you will never have an opportunity to do this.
Volunteer students usually smoke from their own to go to Cameroon, and they often come along with the doctors of contributions.
But after the Yandes arrived, they spend their lives on Anna-jana and instructions.
O'Malay says, "There's no doubt that they're heroes."
They give their lives to this organization, and their desire to help Cameroon's people will never end.
For Val, almost the load of the same job is not hard.
Help others to live a happy life, to fulfill the promise made to their father, these are things that give them great pleasure.
Well says, "I'm very happy to do this."
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.
