Transport camp in West Virginia

"All we've done is in danger in November.
Five weeks away from the most important elections in our life.
It's a big, big-- I'm not running, but I'm actually running because I'm running around all the places to fight the poor candidates," he said.
The trip continued, "You see this terrible, dangerous chemical group of democrats, you are now looking at it.
And they're determined to take power back by means of any means they need, you see this vanity, pain.

Are you trapped?
Ah, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting - it's the truth.
Lebar is no free organization now.
Those who remember what's in their faces are not to be endured here.
When the members of the party in my area accused me and voted, it wasn't a surprise.
Because your mind's spirit will not be welcomed here – I was the last level of the list to tell you about it.
My parliamentary colleague Jean Rian found the same way because he stood firm against Judaism-cracker.
In my case, I was accused of agreeing with Zerembergin.
Regarding the importance of a responsible economic policy, Europe and national security, and similar issues that did not agree with the former leaders.
Friday's Nathan H. Laber meeting said that "We want to include and build the meetings."
I was eight years old as a local Lebanese MP, and this is exactly what happened on Friday night's GCC meeting.
Sadly, today, it is not a matter of the meeting and the promise of "Dulu, mild" politics has been forgotten if it has ever started.
It has been widely acknowledged that the Lebar Party is not compatible with differences and that each of the opinions is justified as to whether it is acceptable for the group leadership.
As Jamie was leader, it started with fellow workers that I thought I had the same political view that they started looking for me and asked me to take a position that I didn't approve of in any way to be national security or eu units.
When I speak in public – and even if I say it, it doesn't matter what I say - there's been calling me to remove me through social media, condemned the center's politics, and I'm told that I shouldn't have a party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed to me are also political.
I'm surprised to see all the workers who face the storm of discrimination or racial violence each day, but never feel ashamed of their career and determination.
In this era of politics, how is the low rate of goalgali become normal?
ZeremiBin claimed that Lebar Party should build a culture of tolerance last week.
The fact is that we are no longer free organization and each compromises the change of the rule of votes or elections.
For the past two years, I've been urging many to put my head down, not so hard, and that I'll be right.
But I'm not here to do this in politics.
When I joined a school for 32 years ago as a teacher in Lbar, we were assigned to Moscow by the government's miscreants that ultimately destroyed our high school classes, I tried to provide needed government services – all that needed to be the local council minister.
I never hid my politics with the last election.
No one in Ntingham East was confused about my policy position and the fields of conflict with the current leadership.
For those who preached the campaign on Friday, I would only say that when the country is moving towards a bridge that would damage family, business, and our public areas, I can't know how to show my loyalty to the party's leaders and to abuse my time and energy.
But I really don't have any message for ninghamum, it's not to my elections, it's either a member or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that I will not prevent any obstacle or political commitment to all of you who believe in it.
Chris Leslie, an MP of Ntingham East.

The director of the Iron Curtain, Blair McFranson, drank the yellow cards and then at the end of a series of severe pressure, gave Bruce Colvin's space to his plane.
While welcome Ra comes right, and when she sees the yellow cards to deal with Clemo, she goes out to the penal line and pulls out of the penal line.

"Bolivia has the speed, unity and neutrality, and surely we expect results from positive perspective," says Bolivia’s Coordinator Caldilla.
Many Bolivian iCzej Ruling will see a large screen across the country, hoping that the Tribunal Bolivian government will take the claim that after a few decades of discussion, Chili Bolivian has been forced to discuss the issue of a subsidiary issue on the Sea of Bolivia.
Ivo Morales, Bolivian Curs, an indigenous president - who will face a controversial conflict for the next year - he also has much to depend on Sombar R.
"We're close to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court cannot decide for Bolivia - and if that happens, it will be a little bit different.
The Netherlands-based United Nations organization does not have the power to provide the ground for Chile and reports that they will not determine the results of possible discussions.
The last six months of the ICZ's verdict, which came only after only six months to hear the final argument, indicate that the case was not "Jeel", the famous Chinese International Law expert.
And over the past four years, it could have gone back to the back of Bolivia.
"The access to the sun has made the current Bolivian administration hacked," said Zeret.
The anti-war speech of Mooral's war speech brought good luck, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk until a visit, but then it will be hard to discuss.
Two countries haven't exchanged the state since 1962.
The government's representatives in The Hague, former president Adordo Radegez Vultz, refused to take immediate action to the court's decision.
Monday, Bolivia's "a wonderful opportunity to have a new age with Chili" and a chance to end the conflict between 139 years of conflict with the Spanish.
Caljadilla also denied that Morales are still using Latin - the most popular president of Latin America as a political case.
"The right to enter Bolivia's Pacific Ocean," he adds.
"It's an opportunity to see that we have to cut off our past"

John Edward: Language skills needed for global citizens
Freedom Schools in Scotland have kept a track record of the Academy of Education, and it has continued in 2018 with a more unprecedented test that is built on personal, art, music, and other community efforts to achieve the success of the efforts of other schools.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, the schools represented by the Scots Council of England (ISIS) have tried to put their students and parents in the best position.
For their students more and higher education, their choice is to prepare for their place as a professional and global citizen.
As a educational field, which can be designed and applied in a special school, we see modern languages continue to be popular and popular in schools.
Nelson Mandela says: “If you talk to a person who understands the language, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, he's in his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that if we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries, we can't just rely on English.
From the results of this year's latest test, we see that the languages are above the lot of the most popular schools.
Among foreign students who are studying foreign languages are 68% of the highest grade.
The report from the 74th class of the SCIS has shown that 72 percent of students have attained the highest grade in Mandarin when 72 percent of German studies, 69 percent of French studies, and 63 percent of Spanish study.
It proves that foreign languages in Scotland support foreign languages as an effective tool for child and young-wed students will surely need in the future.
Language now, as the subject is preferred, is the same as the reading of a separate school and other STDEM topics ( science, technology, technology and math).
In 2014, U.S. Commission for Amplification and Sculners found that the organizers were responsible for their ability to fight zeros, 17% of their language skills.
So further, young people have become essential in preparing language skills for their future careers.
These skills are needed in the world for more opportunities.
Anyone who wants to be Kenya's choice, if they learn another language, will have a real advantage in the future with their life skills.
Before being able to communicate directly with the foreign people, a multibillionary person is automatically contested.
In 2013, more than 4,000 adults in Ukraine were able to speak well in a foreign language, according to a news interview, 75 percent of the French language, and the only percent of the French language, 15 percent.
This is why it is important for children today to invest in language education.
More languages, especially the language of developing economy, will give children a better chance of finding a more meaningful job.
In Scotland, each school will separate in their language.
In several schools, more schools will focus on modern languages, and others will be able to learn the language that is most important to Ukraine, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be many languages to choose in private schools, including experts.
Scotchish schools are concerned for a education environment that will prepare children and prepare them for whatever future they are going to succeed.
In the world’s business environment, it can't be denied now that languages play an important role in the future of the country, so it must be displayed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be viewed as “a skill of international communication.”
In private schools, these love, diversity, and excitement will be expressed for the youth of Scotland's youth.
Must be one.

In the annual general session of Ryang Ho, North Korea said that last year the nuclear and nuclear testing broke down the nuclear test, and promised not to increase nuclear technology and nuclear weapons"
"But we didn't see any similar reactions in the United States."
"If there's no trust in the United States, we'll have no confidence in our national security and there's no way of opposing us in this national situation."

He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - who surprised me, "He told the telegraph."

'We know it won't change the behavior of students immediately.
However, we believe they have the right to know that they have the right to use your cigarette - even if it's the right to know the effects of health, the professor's senior.
He says that the culture of yzart's pride still exists, he adds that sleep is a major problem because of increasing stress on modern technology and students.
A student should be a student’s ‘stressy weapon’ to fight against stress and anxiety, and he says, even the sleep machine, has always made them hungry."
In California, 19-year-old Ramd Solar, 19-year-old, helped to design the conference at Harvard at his first anniversary.
He said that the course opened his eyes and attracted him to a camp-Wed course.
In the next step, he hopes that all students of the Syndicates will ask to complete such a study program before joining the competition.
Professor Sizzler suggests that students should be concerned about when to go to bed and when to wake up and be aware of the impact of the effects of the revolution screen and Elliod Ellios Alo, which may result in the loss of the censored blood.

The U.S. Republican Machin Waters denied that a member of his colleagues posted the personal information page on the Wikipedia page of the United States.
The Los Angeles Demock claimed that these claims were broadcasted by "altra-right Wing" and websites.
In a statement on Twitter, Watts said on Twitter:
According to the report, the U.S. senator's home address and phone number are included in the United States.
On Thursday, this information online posted an unknown person at the CPAL panel hearing about the sexual abuse of the Supreme Court's candidate Bret Canva.
After questioning these three Senator Canana, the trap came for a while.
Lawyers, such as the Gateway PI address and Redstett, reported that the source ID address was associated with the "Whites" office, and a member of a member of the Watsters's staff reported.
"This base accusations are full of lies and a perfect lie, "waters continue to continue.
"My colleagues are members of the identity, personal information and security, which are not responsible for the crime and false accusations.
This base complaint is totally wrong and a perfect lie."
The voice of the Waters was quick to criticize many online online about the previous press press in the White House.
"It's an incredible angry," wrote Fisher.
"It says he doesn't want to be a Congress member."
They will not be angry when they do what they do not do.
They must not be a traitor.
They must not ask questions about the purpose of the accused.
They must be calm and peaceable."
The judge was comparing the reactions of Walters to the judge’s criticism of the voters, which seemed to make him feel very angry when he was on Thursday hearing.
Republlican candidate Omar Navaro, who is chosen to participate in the middle elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's real big," he tweets.
In his statement, Watson said that his office warned the "superior authorities and legal organizations" about these claims.
"We'll make sure the criminals will be revealed," he continued, "and no member of my staff and all of my members will be responsible for the destructive and destructiveness of their actions."
Johnny English Stranges Agencies review - weak Ron Atkinson spy
In any new photograph with British talent, it is now a tradition and it seems to have been applied to republishing the public English action-demony Spuff Franse in 2003 - which began in 2003 and came back to John English in 2011.
Clearly, how many garbage nations will be able to get that personal opportunity to rehabilitate?
Any rate of pop-ups, unable to create new things for John English the second time — his name means that he was designed for a wide-scale music world without English.
He must have shared a note with the foolish secret representative, Mr. Bane and an Olympic event in London in 2012.
He is primarily based on the trailer, and the people of international mystery were once forgotten by the Barcicd TV advertisements.
There's one or two bad moments in the last Zee outing.
I like to visit John English in a helicopter after the middle of the Middle Ages with a little helmet with a little helmet.
The gift of Atkinson is seen for physical jokes, but the jokes are very low and strange, especially in 2007 and the mission of the mission of Ms.S.B.A., as well as an element of "cesssal" is now an element of faith.
It seems like it was intended to raise children rather than adults, and I have an intechnology of the strange nature of John English.
In a number of times, the top Bret Bretton is a serious problem.
A cyber hacker's secret web network in Britain, to express identity for all British agents in the region, is a sad part of a little role to disappoint the agent - for Kevin Elder.
It's the last trust of a Prime Minister who's already suffering the complete corruption of politics: Amama Thompson has made his best-known character with this half-ressa-me, but there's nothing to do in the script.
His informant informs him that every active spy has been uploaded, so he has to get someone out of bed.
And this means John English, who is now appointed as a school teacher in some press, teaches out the record about how to be a teacher: there are some good jokes here, since English is here.
In order to get back to English Whitehouse for emergencying and again in Ben Miller's old-sex with the long-term side of his long-term side.
Babu is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, the role of a zil-heik-Stique, which has been kidnapped by Viki Pederin.
So Her Major's Secret Service returned to Batman and Rabian again in action and faced Olga Kurellenko's wife Ofienko's wife Ofia.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister Crysic has been seriously trapped in a magic spell that claims that he can solve the problems of Britain’s computers: Jack Lassie Lasssi Antivota.
English and Babu started the strange words of their famous high-generative high-gens: at the Wester's Square, they set up fire in a French restaurant; they began to beat themselves to fight and try to identify themselves in the streets of Voltahsbululate; and to make themselves known to the Italian home.
All the stations must be taken for the final attack, but it's the most deadly and open, and the whole thing has a lot of children's thinking about TV.
Very middle staff.
And I couldn't believe like other public English films: British film artist Roanton Atkinsson can't have any role that the truth deals with his case?
Lebar denied that it's planning four days for Britain, but it will pay for five days.
Zeremmyboin's Lebarin party will consider a key plan that the British will see for four days in a week - but get paid for five days.
According to the report, the company's owners would spend more than a day saving workers through the RI (AI) revolution.
It will see the day of the three-day holiday of workers - but it will still be the same paycheck.
According to the source, this idea with the aid of the group's economic activist will be 'Fit' and have plans to move the country for workers.
As a way to get the opportunity to change workers, Tredus Union Congress has allowed to move in a four-day week.
The Sanad Times of a Lebanese party reported: “A policy is expected to be declared before the end of the year.
"It won't happen, but it's a four - day-day wish that the team will be able to be organized in order to protect the community's economy as well as the workers.."
The Lebar Party, the Green Party, promised four days of work during their general elections in 2017.
The wish is not fully supported by the Lebar Party, even if it is not currently supported by the Lebar Party.
A spokesman from the Lebar Party said: "It's not a four-day party policy and it's not being considered by the group."
Shado Chandell, John McDonnell, used his view for a social revolution last week.
Mr. MacDonal says he's determined to turn the power away from the "international director" and 'Lalvises'.
The plans of Shado Chandal can get back to their entire share of water sources because the labor government can give some of the 'developes' because of their wrong actions.
He also has the plan to keep the workers on board and build the owner of the office, who is standing at $500 a year.
Mrs. Grady, tell John Kennedy "60 minutes" if the investigation of the FBI can change their mind.
In the FBI investigation regarding the charges against the accused against BBI Supreme Court, the final votes are less than a week, and the investigations have raised questions about whether a Republician citizen can turn their support.
On Sunday, the newspaper "60 minutes" broadcaster Scott Pelly asked the People's Republican Senator, whether the FBI could detect some of their minds, which led them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleagues from South Carolina.
"Surely, of course, Kennedy said.
"I told you to go to the hearing, I said, I talked to the judge Kavana.
After this incident, I called him out of the complaint, saying, 'What did you do?'
He was a strong determination, useless."
The vote of Garham, of course, seems to be unbiblical.
"My mind was made up of Bret Canana and a very important complaint will need to change," he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has very strong denied it," referring to Christine Blasi ford.
"and whose name he said they couldn't verify.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see any changes."

"In support of you, the United States government, the government, the national government, and the Global Citizen, we can make the social injustice as a sign of history," said the President of the Department of New York’s Department of Justice to the public in April 2018.
The group also said that after over 5,000 action in the United States to improve the birth of mothers and children in the United States, the government announced a project for a project, which will reach 500 million women and children.
The question asked on its website "Who do you think we can end poverty?"

However, like the great citizen rights and opposition movement in front of us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.

The US ambassador accused China of "Galgail" via "Pagda advertising"
A week after a public Chinese newspaper published a newspaper advertisement of the United States's daily wage for four pages, the US president of China accused us of using the US press to promote the purpose of campaigning against Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trophy mentioned on Wednesday, the biggest Chinese daily danes Regier and accused China's U.S. government of attempting to launch the US Congress election on November 6, China.
Tramp reports that Beijing is trying to intervene in the US elections, which U.S. officials have asked Rotterers a new attempt to force China to press China.
This is the normal event that foreign government will advertise for trade campaigns, but Beijing and Washington are now being sent to trade wars, which have caused the increase in the population to add to each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say that the anti-transgressive shells in China were designed to harm the Raptorians who supported the Republican Party of Tromp.
In China’s U.S. ambassadors and Ivo's long days ago, Terry Branstad, a big producer of agricultural farming in China, says that Beijing has affected farmers, farmers, and businesses.
In a post on Brestad Robber, Dennis Regester, says that China has now doubled the campaign with the intention of "we've been in our own rebellion."
Branstad writes: "The Chinese government is taking advantage of American freedoms and free news media through the advertisement of the business advertisements."
"But, in the streets of Beijing, you will find a limited voice and you will not see the difference between the Chinese people's economics and the concerns of China's Communist Party, because the media is in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party."
He adds that his writing "a major newspaper in China refused to print," although he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
The Republicans want to keep women away from female voters before they're made from the media.
In the face of many of the accusations of many high-ranking Republican sex violations, the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court was standing in front of Nominini Bretvenvoff and warned the analysts that they would see a negative reaction from women especially from women in the upcoming media elections.
The feeling of the matter has intensified, and most of the Republicans have already wanted to go ahead with the votes.

Ryhar says that the stress of the last time of the FBI's investigation will calm down the angry voters at the last time.
According to Whiston DC, the President of the Pre-President Movone community and the National Women's Faces, Karen Jean-Pere, said, "Don't forget what has happened to women, they don't forget tomorrow and November."
In spite of the testimony of Dr. Kristin Blagi Ford, the ruling committee of the ruling committee decided to move on to the Repurchasans on Friday, on Friday morning, the protesters sang "November!"
"Negal political analyst Stuttenberg told the news site," the story would be the past of democratic excitement and inspiration.

"It's not just about whether it's the vote or the final vote of the committee, how the Republicans took it and used it with it" is also part of the team of the U.S. group who support the votes of the voters.
However, the Americans seem to believe who needs to believe in the witness of Fordices and Kwanf, and the next one has lost the opinion.
A new survey in Uganda showed that 41 percent of answerers believe in the witness of the Ford, in which 35 percent say they believe that they must either believe in Kwanf, or perhaps they believe in Kwanf.
Also seen, 38 percent said that they thought Kwanf was likely lying at the time of his witness, and that only 30 percent said the same thing about the demand.
After FFBI is under pressure, FBI currently investigates the charges of the FARI and one of the charges against the Ford and one of the authorities, Debora Ramez's report.
Ford was a witness in front of the trial committee last week that Kwanf has been held in the state of Nishant in 17 years.
Ramirez complained that the Supreme Court of Nominini showed her sex in a party during the 1980s.

On personal online data store, this is because it will completely depend on the user - can access information on any type of data.
The company's name is "In private power through the diary."
According to the Society's CEO John Bruce, the Idea of America will help all people get resources, processes, and appropriate skills.
The organization is now composed of a security platform taken by Berners-Less, Bruce, IBM, some of the associated non-stop developers and volunteers.
This week, the technology developers can use tools available on the website of the Irrawaddy.
Berners-li says that he and his team will start a complete change with Facebook and Google where all their business models will be changed completely."
"We don't want them."
In a post published by the media on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Intrape's "the country is designed to protect the integrity and quality of the new web"

Dagger Island: Tom Daily suffers from “unreasonableness” because of sexual immorality.
The Olympic Daily reports that during growing up, he suffered in the absence of sexual abuse - but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old said he didn't go to the media school until he realized that "Sbyby wasn't like me."
During talking about the first radio station on the London Island, he learned that he spoke about the "sha" right to give others.
He also says that after the birth of the child, his opinion of the Olympics has diminished.
A number of days have passed since Christi Yang, a regular member of the program for a long time.
In Leanne's first anniversary, Daily said he felt "you" more than all the rest of the others, because "they were not socially acceptable."
He said: "To this day, it's a real reality to think and feel different, which has given me the strength and strength to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove himself as "one" when everyone knew about his sex so that they wouldn't be disappointed.
In the Olympic Olympics, the high profile of the BOGB has become a campaign and has been working on his presence to identify more countries in Australia than this year's Commonwealth Games.
He said he opened his mouth, because he considered himself lucky to be alive without complicatedness and wanted to give others the "sha".
This three time the world champion spoke of reading in love with a man -- American filmmaker Destin Las Black, with which he was seen in 2013 - "I wondered."
Daily, last year, he married this Sky winner, who was 20 years older than him, who said that there was no problem with age.
"When you were so young, he went to Olympics at 14 and his father died in cancer three years later, he said that it was hard to find someone who was too young to see.
The couple were born by Robert R. Black-Deley, and Daily says that he changed his old views.
He said, "If you asked me last year, I would say, 'I'd have to win a Golden Medal won'.
"The truth is, there is a bigger thing than the Olympic gold.
Raby is my Olympic gold medal"
His son's name is Robert, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years old.
Daily says his father never admitted that he was dying and finally asked if London had confirmed their ticket for 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I never said, 'You won't be anymore in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand while his breath stopped and he left the last breath and died and I didn't admit that he wasn't in power," he said.
Next year, Dale won the 2012 Olympics and Brandodak.
He says, "It was the dream of my whole life-- giving my audience into the Olympics, nothing better than that."
It also inspired his first song - Hedar Schul’s present - which was applied to him in preparation for the Olympics, and what still broke his throat.

He's the one who gave much to this team during the past and the past week.

New war in Germany is again suspended.
Local news reports have been reported that the German Navier team was about to start in 2014 to replace the former cold war-Juge war-Juge, but it would not be until the last year.
According to the military chief, the new Banen-Virtburg-Shirt, the first freelage of this free ship was suspended until the first half of the 2019 "Rainland-Falez".
The ship was supposed to be connected to the Navy in 2014, but this high-ranking project has been in trouble because of the problems of Daily-based problems.
In 2007, the ship that orders four Bon-Virtburg-Virtburg ships will take place in the freeing of the gunman-Clas free.
It is known that they will be in strong kangaroos, Anti-Airfoft and anti-Chip technology, such as Redwood Rader, Infranded and Aqqq.
Other important features include a long duration of waiting - new free versions for the maximum two years from the country's border.
In any case, it means a delay to be delayed, a violent warhead - who is to help Germany in a foreign power campaign - it will be old, DEY JEET's news.
Last year, the tragedy hits the last year when German ships refused to launch the ship and returned back to Hamberg's Blue and Vespaid.
This is the first time a ship sent back to the camp after the ship delivery.
The reasons behind the back are very low, but German media refers to several important "software and hardware errors" that would destroy the ship in battle.
The engines of software are particularly important, because the boats of bin-Virtburg-Virtburgers will be guided by about 120 Noirberg - half of the freelances of the old British category.
In addition, it was shown that the ship’s capacity would reduce its work and make the way to improve the way for further development in the future of the ship.
This 77,000 tons of tons is considered to be twice as heavy as the ship used by Germans during World War II.
As a result, the cost of the entire project has been a problem with the wrong hardware, including the training of Krudo.
At 2.2 billion pounds of primary level, it is amazing that the 3.6 billion pounds (3.6 billion dollars).
New Freeorges have become more important in recent warnings about the storm-power crisis in Germany.
At the beginning of this year, the chief of the German parliament, Hans-Pierre Bartals, admitted that the ships are breaking into the boat's proper ship.
The officer said that the problem was solved with time, because there was no permanent ship that had been cancelled.
He lamented that no boat-carrier ships were able to join the Boden-Virtamberg-Shirtburg-Sharing army.
It's been heard to get a national truck in the secret of the tiger's life.
To find out how the bats are used in the search of food, they are running a new research site at a Scotch Park.
The search can be expected to give new light on the behavior of these unique flying creatures and help save operations in the future.
Researchers from the National Trade for Scotland will be studying the general and the Sopino Pencils as well as the Donanton garden of West Rose.
To track the activity of the bats in the whole Moussum, special records will be set in important places around the area.
The NHS activists and volunteers will also play a live survey using digital technology.
The expert will review all recording words and make the call of the tiger and receive information about what kind of species are going on.
Then there will be a visual map and a report to create a wide range of their behaviors.
NTS is expected to provide the kind of rescue counsel that results that are the most important and most important of areas in the region and how it is used by each species.
This data will help determine how the forests can be protected for plants such as plants and plants and other species of plants.
Over the last century, the number of bats in Scotland and the United States has been very low.
They are in danger of building and development that damage their sleeping place and residences.
Air-based Turnby and light can also be dangerous from some chemicals and building tools, as well as the attack of cats.
It's not blind.
Although their ears are more effective than their eyes because of the habit of hunting at night.
They use an advanced sound-space strategy to identify dangers and obstacles.
NTS, who is responsible for more than 240 historic buildings throughout the country, has been overseeing more than 3000 important wastes and 76,000 hectares of land.
They have ten trained experts who visit regular research, sleepplaces, and sometimes even rescues.
The organization also established the first and only two-dimensional storage space in the 3rd East and Gallos, where eight settlements between the ten-dimensional tribes of Scotland.
East Manager David Thompson says this is an ideal place for bats.
"There's a good place for bats in Thov," he says.
"There's old buildings there, there's many ancient trees and all the best places."
But there's still much more about the growth, so we'll help us understand what we're doing here and elsewhere to save them.
He stresses the importance of knowing the importance of the growth before handling the property, because it could possibly destroy 400 female and child bats because of the destruction of a mother’s home, and the entire local population could be destroyed.
It is illegal to kill animals and kill them, put them to work or destroy their homes.
Elizabeth Farrell, a staff officer of the Bamum Storage Trust, urged Elizabeth to help the public.
He says: "We still have a lot of knowledge about spiders and we don't know how many species live."
Ronaldo refused the charges of rape, and lawyers were going to bring charges against the German newspaper
As a result of the alleged rape against him, he says that people want to "rescuate their own reputation."
His lawyers are ready to plead against German news magazine de Sippel, who brought this complaint.

He has been accused that he gave $375,000 to remain silent about this incident, on Friday's Friday, Friday's Psychology Report.
After a few hours of publishing the claim, he was 33 years old when he spoke with 142 million forwards in his account.
No, no, no, no.
Today, what they say is a lie, says five times in Balan-D-O's victory camera.
"They want to raise their own identity by using my name.
It's normal.
My name says they want to be famous themselves, but it's a living bond.
I'm a happy man and it's all right." The player added a smile.
According to Rotters, Roylando’s lawyers are preparing to file charges against Deer Sippel, who called them "the unbelievable report for Govt."
The lawyer Christian Sarge said that the player would “for moral damage to the victim’s importance, which is probably one of the most serious consequences of personal rights in recent times.”
The story of the incident in Las Vegas in June 2009 is said to have been on a suit of Palms Hotel and Casino.
According to the paper in the Netherlands Clark County District Court, it is said that after seeing a knight club, Rondol and Maoga player went to the house where he raped him, he was raped.

The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that they had sexual intercourse, but it was a cynic.
Maoriga also claims that he went to the police and was taken to the hospital, but later he agreed to settle the issue outside the court because he was afraid of the "strengthening fear of opposition" and "strengthened".
The 34-year-old girl said that she wanted to raise the issue again because she had been emotionally troubled because of the tragedy.

Brexit: Lost U.S. starved as a car manufacturer.
Business Minister Greg Clark says that he will lose his first place in the world to build cars after Brexit.
He adds that it is “dangerous” that U.S. Tortoya told BBC that if Britain left without any agreement, they would just shut down their product in Bernton to the factory.

Marvin Cook, director of the Tortolling Director in Bernton, said, "My opinion is that if Britain comes out at the end of March, our factory might be closed."
Honda, B.D., and Jaguar Land River, have also been concerned about the international trade of the United States without any agreement.
For example, B M. W. said that they would shut down their mini Planet after a month in Oxford.
The main concern is what the car manufacturers say is the danger of having a simple chain in the non-combatant.
Tootter product line is based on the "Jes-in-Time" line, the U.S. car and the results from both of them from 37 minutes to 37 minutes from the owners of the U.S.
If it is left without a US agreement on March 29, it can interfere with the limit, which could delay the distribution and the distribution of the economy.
The organization said that Toruer Daviser can't keep more than a day's present, which could cause the production to cease.
Mr. Clark says that for the future, Thoresa May's check plans for the future are fully designed to avoid such checkups."
"We need a deal. We want to do the best we can not only keep the best deal, but also enjoy future progress in the future," says the BBC Radio 4 in today's event.
"No, no, other producers also prove that the plan to continue is important."
Too was unable to say how long the production would be off, but they warned that the long-term cost will reduce the performance of factory performance, and that could lead to many jobs.
For 24 years in Bernton and the United Nations Union for 24 years, Peter Suvalis of the plant, says that his members are deeply concerned: "When my experience has gone on, they don't come back.

Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says that not keeping the branding because it is not for "showing" to journalists, though, he says: "I don't deny that they're showing people."
He then suggested to promote direct communication between traffic and press.
"We've tried the number of questions by the president of the current president more than any previous president," he said without any evidence stating: "We have tried the number."
Browning will also be in the future, said Sanders, "It's better to talk to the U.S. President directly than to talk to me.
We've tried to do this, and you've seen us doing this for the past few weeks and have been trying to get to the U.S. President of the United States."

A report from Air New Guinea on Saturday, says that a man cannot be found.
The airport reported that they were working with local administration, hospitals and investigations.
Airline immediately refused to report details as well as the fact that this trip is a national event.
After trying to track the plane, some local ships and crews have been able to help rescue the crew and staff when the plane was attacked by the Cake Island Island Airport.
On Friday, the authorities reported that seven were taken to the hospital.
Airline reports that six passengers are in the hospital on Saturday, and they are all in a state of state.
There is still no clear explanation about what happened.
Both Airlines and the United States have said that the plane is going down the runway before it's gone.
Some observers thought the plane was gone on the runway.
The U.S. passenger Bill Janes says that the plane went down very low.
"That's a good thing," says Janes.
Jens says that he and others arrived at the portals when they were in the middle of the boat.
He says that the planes were shouting in terror and a little bit of his head.
The U.S. Navy reported that nearly a district job crew was helping out with the rescue, bringing people to the shore of the Hawa River.
According to the Aviation Security Network, 1111 people have died in PNG-related Airlines last two decades, but there was no disaster in Air New Guinea.
Scholars have been able to repeat the incident during the time of the burning of a living woman.
In 2014, a woman in Mississippi was republished on Saturday for the trial of a woman who was accused of being burned alive.
The judge has witnessed several hours as an expert on the investigation of Paul Raolet Gondal.
He describes how he used cellphone records as 29-year-old Assimi Quintin Titus and the 19-year-old Geska Chambers in front of the night of his death.
Raool says he saved a number of cell phones that indicate that he was together on the evening of death, which was against the previous television report.
Information indicates that he was with his cell phone Chambers, although he had been talking to his friend Michael Sanford, the police told him about Sanford.
Sanford kept witnessing that he wasn't in town at night.
When Koúslas asked if he was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford answered, "My talk is, because his truck was in the Nationalsville."
Another disturbing fact is that Teleles said that he knew him two weeks before the death of Chambers.
Cellphone records indicate that they knew each other only for a week.
ROOOL says that after the death of Chambers, Teleles de de detonates his cell phone, calls, and contraception information.
"He removes her from life," says Hally.
The last of the case is on Sunday.
The judge says that the case is expected to go to jury next day.

“Aaaaaaaaa is another blackang” Mrs. Passco-Flexman writes to her husband in Texas.
Anyway, he sent her to Miss Morris instead of sending her to her husband, twice.
Later, to understand his mistake, he was expelled from the plasco-Flexicman Miss Morris, who was formerly African-American, hoping to do bad things, because of his bad work, the New York Post's report.
Miss Morris was assigned to the mines of one day and then sent home to the house.
Morris is now trialing for the loss of a wife and for six months as a daily wage for the six months, although she was already at home as a nuisance without any agreement.
"I want to show them, see, I can't do that." He called the post Friday, and added a more gambling join, "I know it's weird."
The couple argued that they had the argument to expel Morris was the reason that it was not to believe in him after charges against him.
"My wife didn't want to say what she sent.
He's not an atheist.
We are not an ethnic couple," says husband Joel Plasco post.
"But will you leave your children in the hands of someone whom you have abused, even though it has been forgotten?
Your beautiful child?
Say ".."
Plasko says that his wife was only born two months ago and was among the “hard situation”.

Peddington published fear that readers could not communicate with the good news, published in the new magazine.
Brand's daughter, Karen Jacquel, who was born after the book was accepted, says about the letter: "It's hard to imagine what's going on first time.
It's interesting to know that after Peddington's great success, it's a great deal of success.
His father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before receiving the content of the book of children from small games, said that he would be disappointed in his work last year, saying that he had 60 years of publishing his book after his death.
Regarding Paddington, which he described as "the most important member of our family", says that his father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a quiet man, and not a financial man," she said.
"And Peddington was so real to him that your own child has achieved a success: you are proud of him, though you have no fault with it.
I think he saw the success of Peddington's success.
Although it is his own creation and imagination, he always credited Pediaton.
My daughter was dead, and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was quickly taken to the NASA hospital, Louis Patra, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad regularly called it very bad, and he wouldn't survive," says Mrs. Adnan-Lapros.
"Then I got the phone of Ned and I know he'll die within two minutes and I'm forced to say goodbye to him on the phone.
And I do.
I say, "Thi, Darling, I love you very much."
I'll be right back to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The treatment that doctors gave to his heart gradually stopped working and went out of the body.
He died a while ago and then everything stopped.
There was no way I could wait, you know.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and man.
I had to hold on to myself."
Finally, Mrs. Adran-Lapros, her daughter lamented her death, while other passengers were in the air - she was a different one for this difficult situation.
Nobody knows," he said.
‘I fell down, I was getting water out of my eyes.
It's impossible to describe it, but I sat on the plane and was facing the impossible pain of Ned.
He needs my love and compassion.
I know how much he loved him.
Sadly, this woman posted cards to stop suicide in the bridge.
Two women, who lost their loved people, work to stop suicide.
Sharan Davis and Kelly Hamfres write a card with e-mail messages on the Welsh Wells and the phone number where people can call for help.
My son Tyler, who was 13 years old, committed suicide when she was 18 years old.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm capable of," she says.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old, says that his son was a promise-in-law, and he had the right to laugh.
"Sube knew him for his smile.
Everyone said he'd get the light of his smile."

At the beginning of the FBI investigation, Bret Kwanf's future question is on the face of the future question.
"I thought, if we could give some of what we wanted to do, we might be limited in the investigation - maybe we can bring some together," says Mr. Flek Saturday, adding that he's afraid, the committee might be able to "read" this conflict.
For what reasons did Mr. Kwanf and his Republican supporters not seek an FBI investigation?
Their obedience is related to time.
On November 6th, only five weeks after the election, if the Republicans are expected to do bad things, they will become very weak to find people in the highest court of the country.
George W.B.S. is calling Mr. Kwanf to support Mr. Kwanf under the White House under Mr. Bush, who was also known as Mr. Bush's personal secretary, Mr. Bush.
What happens when the FBI report is released?
There will be a vote on the site, where 51 Republican and 49 democrats are currently.
Mr. Kwanf is not clear if at least 50 votes can be received at least from the site, but if the brother-President is able to make sure he's in the Supreme Court to break the issue.
The number of participants in North Korea's group is under Kim.
After Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean parties was reduced, stating that a law law in South Korea was issued.
Park Bang-seg, the South Korean Ministry, quoted the information that last year the group was 1,127 - which was in 2011.
Mr. Park says it is the root cause of the harsh control between North Korea and China and human trafficking.
Pyyyang didn't comment on it.
Most of the groups from North Korea have been assigned to South Korean citizenship.
Soul reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have passed across the border since the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them have fled to China, with the long-term border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross a very safe military zone between two Koreans.
China, not as refugees, is considered illegal immigrants, and often force them to return to their country.
The relationship between North and South Korea - who are still in the war - has improved in recent months.
At the beginning of the last month, the leaders of two countries gathered in Pyongyang, where the center of nuclear communication was located.
It is followed by a historical conference between the US President Donald Tromp and Kim Jung-un, in Singapore, when they were granted free Korean support to create nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Re Yong-ho blames the US ban for the progress of the development.
In a speech given to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. R. R. Ree says, "If there is no trust in the United States, our national security will have no confidence and we will never be in such a situation.."
Nancy Pellossy called the "hestoricia-Grasset" and said that he was unbelievable in the Supreme Court.
The number of Hossi Phansi leader, Nancy Pappolis, brought the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court to "heistia-greoff" and said that he was undeterred in the Supreme Court's office.
Palosy Saturday Astin, Texas, commented on a visit to Texas.
In front of the CEOC on Thursday afternoon, he said about his reaction to Kwananfi's witness in front of the Cyndia committee, "I can't believe if a woman would ever have done such a thing, he was called "Heseria-gressive."
Kevinoff strongly refused to complain that Dr. Kristin had sexual relations while they were both young.
During his initial statement, Kevinf was deeply touched by talking about his family and high school life.
He clearly condemned the democrats in the committee and complained that a "Uberal and organized character" was being taken from the anger of the president of Heler Clinton's 2016 presidential election.
Palosy says he believes that Kavanif is not worthy of the Supreme Court, because he has proved that he is a rival against the Decattors.
"I think he made the statement he gave and the way he defended Clinton and Democrats," he said.
When he was asked to make sure that Kwanf was sure and that the Democratraras would condemn him, Palosi expressed unpublished when he was asked if Kavanif was sure.
"I'll tell you that if he doesn't tell you the truth about Congress or FI, he's not just the Supreme Court, but he's also in court."
Kwanf is currently the judge of the SC's Central Court of Apples.
Pallosy adds that as a decomotor, he is concerned that the Kevin Afford CAR, or Ro. Wend, he himself is a member of the Communist Party.
In hearing his confirmation, Kwanf has avoided the question whether he will change some decisions in the Supreme Court.
"It can't be allowed to be allowed to go to the court of Hesia-Graste, the innocent, tell us, 'This is not great," Plosy says.
And women should handle it.
It's a fair debate, month and year after year, and he can't be crying.
"When we're angry, we tell me 45 years later."
"I don't think it's rare, what do you say?"
He added: "I have been helped by a woman who said he was angry, but he chose to cry when he started to cry when he started to cry, "I can feel sad, because I am crying."
I'm really angry."
Then he went on.
I thought it was amazing."
The tears usually act as an indication of anger because they are basically the victims of misunderstandings.
A first-hand job I've had a strong memory, a man-cub office, where I once looked at myself in incredible anger, a old woman caught my scarf - a terrible manager who was always afraid of me - who took me to the staircase.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll see."
Patrick Schourder, then director of Colorado Democratic Congressman, worked with him during the presidential election of Gary Hart.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a foreign boat on a foreign boat about marriage and went out of the struggle for illegal work, he was deeply disappointed that his own president had no reason to be a candidate.
"It wasn't a very interesting decision," he said in laughter after 30 years.
"It's already seven other candidates are in the fight, and no one else has ever asked for another candidate.
One said to it, "Sono white and seven times."
In the beginning of the campaign, he turned back on the tax collection, and he insisted that he wouldn't take $2 million in the race.
It was Her War.
He saw that he was only given $20,000 to a colleague to pay a man.
"Do they think I'll earn?" he wondered.
When he announced that he would not drive an official campaign, he was very angry with emotion and his supporters, making it hard for him to collect money, which caused his frustration with the arrangement, and became angry with the voters.
"You could think that my snipers have happened," says Mirz Shreda, a news reporter.
"You could think Clinx is my company Spain.
I remember, I thought, where would they bury me?
"He cried."
How can this commercial war in the United States-Chine War go to Beijing?
The first festival in the United States-Chine-Chine war, and when the war finally ended, Beijing could be a long time in the conflict with two countries, like experts.
The U.S. President Donald Tromp, the Solar Panel at the beginning of this year, was first warned to increase the value of the traditional Chinese roses, as well as the importance of making them the first.
The most outstanding answer was this week when about half of the total import from China, which is about 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), is placed in new dolls.
Beziing has been a revenge every time – most recently they have increased from 5 to ten percent over the US$60 billion.
China has decided to keep an eye on its eyes, and there is no chance of getting eyes on the second greatest economy in the world.
The claim to hit Washington is to be taken, but in public, China's president Zinping would be very insulting to China's President Zinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing can play cards properly, the pressure of the US commercial war can actually help China in a long time.
"What the rapid political decision of Washington or Beijing could cause the situation to begin in both countries is much more dangerous than the idea of a financial fall," says the writer of the Center for New American Security Project, who is a member of the United States Security Council of China.
Syria said to return her refugees back, the Foreign Minister.
Syria says that the country is ready to return to refugees, and for seven years the war has demanded to rebuild the land.
During the United Nations conference, Foreign Minister Waaled Al-Millom says that the situation is improved.
"The situation is stable and secure today because of the ongoing conflict against terrorism."
The government has been rehabilitated to bring back to the areas that are destroyed by terrorists.
All the conditions are now exposed to the country’s willingness to leave because of terrorism and global economic conditions.
The United Nations estimate that more than 55 million people have fled the country since the beginning of war in 2011.
6 million people left the country need human assistance.
Al-Mimom says that the Syrian government welcomes all the help to rebuild the country.
However, he insists that no conditioning support will be accepted or not receive help from the nation of rebels.
