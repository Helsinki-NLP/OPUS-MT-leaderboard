I'm reading your book.
Nothing's missing.
He was talking.
Can I eat?
Too long from Tom Merry.
The kid's kissing.
I'm sleeping all the time.
Ten, ten, three, three, five, five, five, four, aches, aches, aches, and a hundred.
He's reading the books in the evening.
I've won.
Take Amam's room.
I won't support it.

I shouldn't have log out.
Why?
Tom's getting too fast.
I know we still love each other.
Excuse me. I've been waiting for you.

I told them to send another ticket.
I can't believe it!
Tom will talk.
He explained the literal meaning of the phrase.
Here you go.
Read it first.
How old is your father?
I saw that my mother was too busy to put some clothes on it.
How much did you eat?

Wait outside.
Can you take me to the Grand Hotel?
I'm not rejecting it.
The puzzle's funny.
They need friends.
Why don't you try to get your money back?

It's smaller than me.
How long have you been in Boston?

What did you bring?
He told me he'd go to Venice.
Listen carefully.
Can you take a break?
She's smaller than me.
I don't speak Japanese.
We're both right.
Tom's asleep outside.
Sit down.
Don't worry about me.
It's gone.
What happened?
I agree with you.
How much is it worth?
How can they forget us?
I understand your situation.
I'm not Tom.
What a joke!
My book is here.
I'm Tom's wife.
I'm not too busy right now.
Where are you going on Monday?
They're squeezing.
Tom Jackson wrote three books.
Tom told me that today.
I don't want to go to Boston.
Your answer is wrong.
I know.
I'm just kidding.
I'm not proud of that.
Run it.
The train came in time, so we didn't have to wait.
I'm not your friend.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Come with me.

I don't find it in the grass right now.
Where's the mistake?
I can't attend the meeting.
It's a doctor.
I'm going to the next station.
Are you a doctor?
I'm eating now.
You should ask him for advice.

He's a doctor.
Goodbye.
You look sick.
I want a guitar.
Do I have to save the seat?
Is that blood?
Call me tomorrow.
Wester, get some water for me.
Let's find out where Tom is.
My mother could play a very good piano.
Can you speak French?
We'll eat now.

I'm glad to see you again.
They don't care.

Hold my hand.
How can they forget us?
That's why you don't want to be alone.
Would you like to go shopping with me?
How old are you?
Don't go to the kitchen.
Call me tomorrow.
Sit where you want to.
Tom doesn't want to hear it.
We're Arab.
Tom's hurt.
Where are you staying?
Just laugh.
I lost your phone number.
Everyone's here.
Will you eat something?
I can swim.
There's nothing left in Freez.
Nothing happened.
Everyone's lying.
I'm your friend.
Time's up.
Try another.
Have you ever eaten a fucking fish?
He was giving a speech.
I like him.
How long you are!
I did my job.
I want my uncle.
I was eating.
I don't like my body.
Where he went, his dog followed him.
You're not a doctor?
I saw him running.
Tom is a boy and Mary's name is Mary.
Tom's in trouble, right?
What's your name?
Let's go.
How much is that worth?
Do what he says.

I'm not worried.
Is this site empty?
We win.
My brother is two years older than me.
Stop!
The hotel was built last year.
Eat everything.
I want my guitar.
Stop that woman.
What will you do tomorrow?
Don't talk.
You can write any language. All languages are equal in Tobeba.
They're here.
It's his home.
Forty million people call them English as their first language.
This house is my cold.
Where can I buy food?
Leave him.

No one understands me.
Go away.
A country in New York.
He's sleeping like kids.
Can you show me your boarding pass?

I thought you'd come.
Tom's so cute.
I'm busy.
You can go home now.
He's smaller than me.
I think Tom's good.
I'll go back to Australia for two days.
Tom told Mary that she was going to kill herself, but she didn't have the courage to do that.
Would you like to catch the fish with us?
Although it's not bad for itself, in many cases, many have seen too much television.
You should ask him for advice.
I'll take him.
I'm getting cold.
I'm sorry.
I'm still your friend.
I can't believe I believed Tom.
Be careful.
My son can't count yet.
Run the car.
I eat.
I don't want to go shopping alone.
How far is the station from here?
He was sick last week.
Tom jumped at the door, but no one came out.
He's a doctor.
Stop kissing.
I'm hurt.
Go to the hospital.
The state has come back.
Please continue.
Break the pan.
Tom always speaks to him.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
I refuse.
Wait outside.
I want a taxi now.
Shut up.
Who is he?
It happened at least three times.
Tom wants me to go with him.
We'll try it once!
Tom's tired.
Don't forget us.
Tom kept talking.
I'm on the south side of the north.
You're so tired.
Tom kept me waiting all afternoon.
He's eating.
She was sick last week.
I'll see you next month.
We need to contact Tom's parents.
Where can I buy that magazine?
I'll be back in seven days.
Is the harbor so deep?
I was late.
Call Tom.
How much?
Tom saw her.
How long is your plane?
Tom's long, but not long like me.
He's my wife.
I'm not good at swimming.
Where's the tourist office?
Don't go.
Your shoes are here.
He didn't tell me his name.
Okay, I'll see you again.
Are you staying here?
What happened?
$100 with rent trucks.
I'm not very good in French.
My father is going to China.
Can he speak French?
I want it.
I'm your friend, right?
Help me!
I'll help you.
I don't agree with him.
Call the police!
I was worried.
There's a cup on the table.
I'll be back in an hour.
I have to get out of this ship.
That's Tom.
He hasn't come yet.
Kim laughed so sweet.
I don't live in town.
Women bring changes in the world.
Let's get some lights.
I don't want Tom to see me in this position.
Tom started shouting.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
It'll cost you.
Start here.
We were waiting for them.
My yellow choice.
Tom decided to keep a diary.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
I'm not your friend.
How old is he?
Come back.
Why are you shouting?
Can I get a check?
Do you have any bigger size?
Tom's got double from me.
I need it.
I think you don't need any help.
Tom waited outside the gate.
Don't wait.
Is the museum open today?
Don't wait.
Don't worry about me.
Shall we eat out today?
Keep Tom away from me.
Tom's hurt.
He's in charge.
Is my London cape ready?
Where can I buy it?
I need to send a fax.
He's eating too much.
He taught me to write.
Call my cousin.
I could play that song.
I was surprised.
Where's Boston?
We're called.
The rules are simple.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
You're better than me.
He hasn't reached yet.
I can't shake my right hand.
I'm in the hospital.
Tom caught the thief.
Tom, I want to talk to Mary.
Do you understand me?
Tom was surprised to hear that Mary and John were married.
Success depends on efforts in most areas.
Tom laughs very funny.
Tom broke his head.
Were you born there?
Everyone knows it now.
I got my shoes.
I was surprised.
Are you on the move?
Is there a black teeth?
The connection is disconnected.
Can I get a knife?
Have you ever broken a bone?
I want to put it next step.
How are you?
I'll go to the dentist tomorrow.
I can't believe it!
Isn't it?
He hasn't come yet.
They're a doctor.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Have you ever been in the horse?
He was talking.
I have two brothers.
What's the matter with you?
I didn't have to say anything to Tom.
Try more.
Tom laughs.
Why are you sitting there?
What language is spoken in the United States?
I'm tired.
He has two daughters.
I want you to talk to Tom.
I'm your friend.
Follow Tom.
Tom always talks about him.
He's an experienced teacher.
I think you both know Tom.
Tom's here.
Everyone wants happiness.
I forget your phone number.
Tom lost.
You're tired, don't you?
Tom Jackson is your real name?
Go on.
Everyone saw it.
Where's the bus going?
As Tom spoke French, I didn't understand what he was saying.
I want this guitar.
It's a doctor.

He's walking.
What does this sign mean?
The letter was written.
Stop here.
Tom saw you.
Come with me.
No, thank you.
Wait here.
Have I been late for a while?
Leave him.
I can't be right.
A medium of language holo communication.
Tom knows that.
I've never heard of Tom even like that.
How long does the next train leave for Tokyo?
Tom's taking a big risk.
Are they yours?
What are you talking about?
I'll work.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You're rich.
Will you go to America next month?
I don't want to swim.
I'm not the owner.
Thank you very much.
He hasn't come yet.
I'm sorry!
I want to tell you how much I want to tell you.
The snow represents a large number of bats.
Come out.
They screamed.
I ran home.
We made pancakes for breakfast.
Don't you have a bicycle?
I don't know if he's coming.
You're shouting.
He's Keklin.
He doesn't want to talk about this.
Everyone saw it.
I'll give my cat a meal every morning and in the morning.
My son came home.
I'm a student.
I'll be there.
Do you have your passport?
Please clear my voice.
Do what he says.
I'm tired of seeing you.
Tom started shouting.
Sit there.
I wasn't alone.
I've learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom always speaks to him.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We saw them.
Today is June 18, and Moriel's birthday.
Who won?
Come on, let's get ready.
We're just gonna have to let Tom do this to us, don't we?
Can these pieces be resurfaced?
I'm going to Osaka station.
I don't think Tom is responsible for this.
Someone's a kollow.
I went to the barracks.
I learned to live without him.
My father is very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Let's get some lights.
Tom was very busy with work.
I'm not proud of the way I used it.
I kissed you.
We'll work.
He came.
I don't agree with him.
Come to me.
I'm kissing you.
My hand doesn't work properly.
Forget Tom.
What courage!
Is this the book of Tom?
He was angry.
Who are you?
I could have died.
Are you sure?
Now we have to go.
He ignores education.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
They eat healthy food.
My mother loves music.
It's easy to get his head warm.
Wherever he went, his dog was behind him.
Who is this?
Can I work here?
There's still a problem.
It's my desire to collect old bottles.
I like the cheese.
I don't want to go.
When will the next bus leave?
What does that mean?
Don't you have a bicycle?
Do you want to come?
My mother could play a very good golf.
He knows where we are.
I know your name.
Tom's not here now.
What did you say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom stopped shouting.
How old is Tom?
Come on!
Stop kissing.
Was Tom there?
I shed blood in the afternoon.
My back is still suffering.
Where's Tom?
They look like Americans.
You were the only friend to Tom.
I went to the hospital.
I accepted his invitation.
My father can drive a very good car.
I'll be alone.
You need a friend.
Forget about Tom.
I think Tom said his position was Jackson.
You knew Tom for a long time more than I did.
I know.
I'm playing soccer now.
My wallet hasn't reached yet.
Tom hasn't come here yet.
Please wait until he comes.
Tom's very short talking about him.
Eat something.
Is there anyone at home?
What are you doing?
I think Tom's good.
Where do I get the platform?
I'm going to bite.
Can he speak French?
Tom might want to take it.
We love our country.
Is he a doctor?
Can you take a little more?
And one day he left.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friend.
Stop that woman.
How old is that church?
Ask me tomorrow.
It's still mine.
Where am I supposed to claim my wallet?
We do whatever we want.
Tom is right.
I ran to my mother.
This book is not Japanese for students who are not Japanese.
Tom wanted to be the minister.
Who would you believe?
He's a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I wanted.
Nobody's worth it.
Are you here?
The rest of them laughed.
How long will you stay?
Did you see the man in this picture?
I lost my wallet.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want Tom to wake up.
My son is paying money.
The sky looks like snow can begin tonight.
How much does it cost?
You know what Tom wants.
We'll dance.
I can't stop Krish.
I just want Tom to be happy.
Those who live in the mud shouldn't be rocked.
Why are you shouting?
Stop Tom.
I think I should go to the hospital.
Tom wants his roof back.
Is Tom at home?
Tom always keeps his word.
I'm drunk.
I'm your friend.
How long have you been?
Who's here?
The city is divided into a river east and west.
Come see yourself.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I have to go to sleep.
Do you have a car?
Tom is playing the guitar.
Do you have any idea what to do now?
He's having lunch now.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
You should ask him for advice.
This tooth hurts.
How much do they have?
How much to give for extra fish?
Everyone liked Tom.
What happened here?
Take your keys.
Are you Japanese?
Let's get some lights.
Eat whatever you like.
Take this.
Have you ever broken a bone?
He was angry.
We learned English.
I couldn't break my right leg.
I've got a dry skin.
How old are you?
Can I ask you a question?
What is that?
Take your keys.
We've seen more bad things.
Help Tom.
I'm almost sure.
What is that?
He's eating.
He likes the crores.
You don't understand.
My mother's hurting.
Sit in the table.
She's smaller than me.
What's your name?
We were waiting for you.
Tom was in there.
Can I use credit card?
It's too big, isn't it?
This book is only found in France.
Tell me.
I'll take him.
Can I buy credit with credit card?
Tom found my bike.
I went home to Jackson's house.
He had a black hat.
Anything else?
Everybody kissed.
Any left for students?
I eat noodles.
Tom's in the house.
Don't ask what they think, ask what they do.
Will you come in?
I'm telling you.
We like football.
What are you gonna eat?
Good evening.
He ate empty fruit.
I want a new suit for these shoes.
Everyone liked Tom.
Who is that?
I'm still your friend.
Rejoice.
Please listen!
He's running.
I'll go to bed tomorrow, but tomorrow's rain.
My right cheeks are hurting me.
My father was busy.
Everyone's ready to go.
I couldn't hold the train at 7:00 a.m.
He had two daughters.
This is my wife.
Let's talk.
Do you have a panel?
The class doesn't start long ago.
How much time do you spend in lunch?
What does that word mean?
How much do I get?
Can you say English?
What they did was wrong.
My son is taller than me.
Tom was also a singer.
Here you go.
Tom's alive.
He's looking at the factory.
Answer me.
This bag is mine.
Tom was angry.
How much is it worth?
You can eat as much as you want.
Let go.
I've got a little light.
Can you speak French?
He's a doctor.
Fill it up.
How old are you?
Hold on to Tom.
They kissed him.
You're shouting.
I don't think it's gonna rain tomorrow.
I'll be back when I finish.
I like the light.
He grew up in France.
He didn't work on Sunday night.
He taught me to write.
Happy birthday!
It's not your book, it's mine.
The Trores have been killed.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
Tom's father is a pig.
Listen.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
It's time.
I never forget.
Where's the opening door in the UA11?
I'm cut.
Why are you laughing?
Tom wants his roof back.
Where do you usually go to sleep?
The country had a deal of agreement between themselves.
I speak in French with Tom.
Tom opened his eyes.
Can you put this on a little gooft?
Tom's in the garage now.
What did you forget?
I don't really want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He's laughing.
He hasn't come yet.
It's not mine.
Who came?
He's eating the fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
The terrorists left the prisoners.
I could have gone with you, but I didn't have time.
I lost my resignation.
He's a good man.
We did it.
The government has made a comeback.
Get out of the city!
Gunnun for thirty.
He's eating.
How old was that church?
Let's go!
This is Japanese.
Did you see her move away?
Where do you leave the bus for the airport?
Don't fight.
That's my cat.
That bag is mine.
I have an old computer that I don't need anymore.
I've got a seat.
We walked on foot.
I want it.
I need those papers.
Tom screamed.
Tom laughs very low.
Eat whatever you want.
Tom's crying.
How much is it worth?
I'm fine.
They're a doctor.
It's time for the plane to be right.
I don't know what you mean.
Most of the audience were businessmen.
Turn right.
Tom's probably sleeping.
I've got a lot of shit.
Tom has won a lot.
He knows where we are.
I've learned a lot from Tom.
Tom's all the shit.
Everyone was shouting.
I'll stay out.
My mother can cook good food.
They're skinny.
The research was successful.
I think Tom's got a little chance to keep the gold he found.
Boston is a big city.
I'm 17.
Here's your key.
Let's talk to Tom.
Eat your milk.
The name of both of us is Tom.
They were all happy.
Is this your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who broke the flowers?
Tom's hurt.
Go back to the top of the Tom.
Is Tom still angry with me?
Tom, it's fine.
We were waiting for you.
I'm not perfect.
Do you know what he said?
Listen carefully.
We made a lot of mistakes.
Why are you shouting?
What's your father's name?
Look over there.
Let me know if I do something.
We tried.
Tom resigned on October.
The market is next to the doctor.
Happy Canad Day!
I'll be late.
What does this sign mean?
Tom broke his head.
Are we ready?
I like Tom Blue Annas.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen carefully.
Are you going to go shopping with me?
Take it easy.
They're there.
I'll kiss you.
Everybody's tired.
Don't let me get married.
Who was that?
I'm Lazuak.
When I said that Mary left the city, I was really surprised to see Tom.
I heard the screams.
How long is your plane?
You don't want to talk about this.
I thought this book was interesting.
Tell me what happened.
I'm up today at 8:00 a.m.
Please burn the light.
Tom's hurt.
I'm still your friend.
Some pages took more than two hours to translate English.
Are they yours?
Who is he?
Is this the smallest way to get to the station?
Tom tried to kill Mary.
Do you know her?
It's impossible!
How long does the train reach Yakoma?
What the fuck is this?
The words that don't correct are correct, and you can add more common translations instead.
Your shoes are here.
Are you ready for tomorrow?
Has anyone left any news for me?
I want to cook for you.
Listen, does this train reach Washington Square?
We failed.
There's an Essie in this house.
Did you wear the whole thing?
Tom Boston was gone.
Say it clearly.
Don't open it.
Tom saw him.
The evening can be snow.
I'm not proud of him.
Is there anyone there?
It's wrong.
I'm not young anymore.
He's eating.
It's just blood.
Are you going to catch the fish with us?
Wait right here.
I'll be back in a minute.
Wait a minute.
Tom was injured.
Mary explained.
I'm not rejecting it.
Don't see!
End it as quickly as possible.
Use it.
How long does the train reach Yakoma?
I don't understand that either.
I've got seven hours this morning.
I'm at home.
Let's move slowly.
Happy birthday!
I'm in.
Me too.
I'm not too busy.
It's amazing.
Do it again!
Tom started in the sky.
They're children.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why don't you go?" "that's why I don't want to go."
I know that.
I'll stay close.
Call me tomorrow.
Tell me what you want.
I'm hurting my legs.
Ask Tom.
I'm thinking about what I'll give you in birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
Nice to see you again.
Why are you shouting?
Stay right there.
Eat the food you like.
We played the park.
I'm busy.
Where can I buy tickets?
I've finished my work.
I'm planning to stay at the hotel.
I finally got my keys.
Tom started shouting.
I'm not arguing.
Can you read?
How old is your father?
Are you okay?
I never saw Tom happy.
Don't get in there.
We're lost.
Tom's laughing.
We can still do that.
I tried.
I'm sick.
I'm just looking, thank you.
Unfortunately it's true.
We were waiting for them.
How old do you think I'm watching?
Tom's not happy here.
It was angry.
I don't like coffee.
Talk more slowly.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to meet Tom?
Here you go.
We don't complain about what he does.
I called my best friend Tom.
We can never play better than that.
We're Lazuak.
The bill will be released today.
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know it's not right.
Eat what you like.
I have wine.
Why did Tom cry?
