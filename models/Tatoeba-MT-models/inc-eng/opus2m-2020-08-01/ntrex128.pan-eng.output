Jon Edwards: Language class needs global citizens
The head of Scotland’s Department of Education maintains a traffic record of suddenness in schools, and it is being released in 2018 with another set of results, which is built up with only a set of games, art, music, music, and other social groups in the United States.
These schools, represented by the School for Development School (Esia·siʹ), try to provide their students and parents the best career possible.
The goal of the self-presiding schools is to teach their students the next and higher education they have to choose careers and prepare them as citizens of the world.
A education field that can design and apply the text of the Bispok School, we see modern languages as a popular and important topic in schools
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, he goes into that direction.
If you talk to her in her language, she goes into her mind.
This is a powerful equation that we can't rely only on English when we want to have relationships and trust with others.
We can see that the recent recent test results in this year are the peaks of the League table in high schools with the highest peaks of the League table.
68 percent of the students had read foreign languages and received a high grade A.
The 74 members of the SCISA call for a set of schools that hold 72 percent in Madrid, while 72 percent of those who receive it are reading German, 69 percent of the French, and 63 percent of French people are learning Spanish.
It gives evidence that foreign languages are supporting foreign languages as a special teacher in schools in Scotland that there will be no doubt in time for children and young people.
Now in the context of a subject, the study of the STM (known as knowledge, advanced, engineering and mathematically) is being done as a self-edited school textbook and anywhere else.
In 2014, a survey conducted by the Commission for Daily and Marketers in Ukraine found that 17 percent of the languages are lacking in combating jobs by unemployment.
So young people are being more involved in learning language skills to prepare for their future.
Language needs to be needed for more potential employment opportunities in a wide world. These skills require skills.
If anyone wants to choose a presentation, if they have learned another language, they will actually give them the real prize of life in the future.
As the ability to communicate directly with people of foreign countries will be put forward in their own fight.
According to a news poll of more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent of young people were reluctant to speak foreign language in order to continue their conversation well and French is a percentage of 15 percent of the languages spoken by 15 percent.
That's why it's important to give money to the children of today’s day to teach language.
Many languages, especially developed meaning-divisions, will be prepared with a wonderful opportunity to get children good sense.
Only within Scotland will be different in every school language they teach.
Many schools will be focused on modern languages, while other languages that have to be seen by 2020 will teach the most important languages, such as Myanmar or Japan.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be several languages to select at the self - sacrificing schools, including the teacher’s staff, including those in the area.
Spatial self-employs are dedicated to provide environment for education in schools that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to be successful among them in the future.
At this moment it cannot be denied, in a world market environment, that language is very important to the country, so it should be reflected in this education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered “international communication skills.”
Manual school leaders will continue to provide a choice for young people of Scotland.
