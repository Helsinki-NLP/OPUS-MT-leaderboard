Now I have called to you, that I might make my defense.
I hope to come to Jerusalem for joy.
We're strong.
Why did I come to you for a visit?
I believe that I am evil.
But I went so far as to prove him.
Now woe to me, if so be that I don't know how to interpret!
Omji Maeju Deen.
And I intended to put him to test him.
We're out of khitaney.
I command you that you don't command him to take him away.
Maldanje Tomeski?
I didn't think so.
Zana Nai?
Ummi de la la la la.
Halam khitane.
I will give him as much as he can.
I'm Kangaleju Tom Toxdadas.
I'm just a jockvar.
O'Neilledno
We're walking around here.
Oi Tomeja de Maori Najee's big hair.
Not intel me what kind of kiniel's Tom.
We're kh kha kh khtattane.
I'm a puppy of olive juicy.
I have given to Mary the anointing oil that is in her hands.
We're making khs of tea teasing on a cassing.
Why don't you sleep?
I'm fucking beaten on top of the Tomes.
I have spent my days in weakness.
Don't talk khitane.
