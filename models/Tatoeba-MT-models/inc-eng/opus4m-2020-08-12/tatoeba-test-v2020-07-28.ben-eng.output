Tom won't win.
Tom thinks you're stupid.
Stop screaming.
He doesn't have any work to do.

I thought this book was interesting.
I don't know the answer.
I love to stay.
I don't want to go with you.
I'll be back in three weeks.

Can you understand French?
I'll be back late.
Tom says he'll resign.
Eat!
Tom has fallen.
Children love to do this.
It's so bad for him.
Did you ever do that?
What's the matter with this?
How many days are there today?
Goodbye.
He was angry.
I agree.
My dad likes pizza.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I wrote a letter.
I like Apple.
Didn't you buy it today yesterday?
Eat the leg!
It's not true what you're saying.
They have two daughters.
Any leave for the kids?
Come here!
All ignored Tom.
I live in a small village.
Watch out on Tom.
How much is the price?
Don't look!
We agree.
Tom went out.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

You must eat the sari.
Who can you take a day's vacation?
I want to change my ticket.
Tom obviously is not happy.
Eat whatever you like.
They all shouted.
It's late.
Smell us.
I didn't get my test.
I had a cat.
Don't wait.
How long have you opened this?
It's ours.
Why don't you try to get your money back?
Can I see your passport?
I can't find a word.
How can you be so calm?
Eat what you want.
Rome's in Italy.
Tom's tired.
I can handle it.
When will you come back?
Can you speak French?
I won't let it make you alone.
That's how it says that Mount Everest is the roof of the Earth.
I sat down.
Come back.
Tom tried to keep his mouth up.
Tom's dead.
Tom cried like a child.
Leave him.
I don't know anyone else from a jumble.
I'm reading your book.
Nothing.
He was talking.
Can I eat?
Tom's taller than Mary.
The kid's laughing.
I'm sleeping all the time.
Ten, ten, thirty, three, forty, five, five, four, four, sixty, and one hundred.
She's reading books in the evening.
I won.
Take Omar's room.
I won't extend it.
Good night!
They're all breathing.

Look at bike passengers and passengers!
You're always complaining.
For what?
I want to open an account.
You'll have to cut the tickets to the bus.
It's not hard to learn French.

The church bells.
Let me go.
I accepted his invitation.
They have two juvenile girls.
Do you have a car?
You're so brave.
Don't hurt me.
Do you have a bike?
Now the most important thing you can do is be calm.
Where's the store of shit?
Look at Tom.
How long will you stay?
I walk to school.
My throat is dry.
I have a new red car.
Call me.
Keep an eye on Tom.
"Why don't you go?" "Why don't I go."
You're not the first man who told me this.
He's eating.
Tom cut a good swim.
It doesn't work?
He doesn't want to talk about this.
I've learned a lot from you.
Dock me.
Do you have a car?
Do you eat meat?
Is there any other way out there?

You're not paying attention.
Can you show Tom around?
Take it.
Please admit my sincere apology.
Do you have anything to tell me?
I don't understand you.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
I accepted his invitation.
Is Tom okay?
You're a doctor.

What are you doing?
Only one language is not enough.
Don't move!
They screamed.

Tom wants to catch the fish.
He's close.
I like him.
It was important.
Tom closed his eyes.
Where's your stuff?

You always complain.
Do you eat meat?
My cheeks are hurting.
Can you keep watch on Tom?
Can you play piano?
Look at Tom.
I got a call from Tom today.
It's my fault to hear the song.
I want to buy them.
What's your name?
Don't yell!
The river fell into the Pacific Ocean.
Why are you shouting?
I love to write songs in French.
Tom needs a friend.
Nice to see you again.
How do you expect me to do this?
I saw him running.
I don't want to eat now.
Set yourself up.
I know Tom was your friend.
Stop investigating the investigation.
How many ribbons have you seen behind Owen's back?
How can I go to the airport?
I need a doll!
Tom's laughing.
Tom, I'm just busy here.
He's having lunch now.
I found her home easy.
I promised you.
That's mine.
We'll win.
You can eat what you want.
I can't find my wallets.
When did Boston leave the train?
How deep?
I ran out.
I don't care what he does.

I didn't forget.
We write our own songs.
Are you okay?
I'll do my best not to bother your education.
Trust me.
I'm sorry to be late.
He can say whatever he wants.
Were you there?
I know your name.
What's the ticket for music?

I accepted his invitation.
What does that mean?

You didn't understand.
They're all screaming.
Can you speak slowly?

Tom wanted you to take it.
I've done my job.
My father can raise the plane.
Who doesn't want to win?
He's eating fruit.
Attack!
Tom screamed.
Tom said that Mary allowed him to leave immediately.
Is this book Tom?
How long you are!
It's past noon.
Don't leave me alone.
Where can I buy the stamp?
I heard the screams.
Will you come down?
I'm idle.
He lied about his age to enter Tom Club.
As long as you want.
He's sleeping like kids.
I didn't notice.
Are you eating meat?
I want to cut the beard.
Don't stop here.
Forgive me, but it's not possible.
I want your opinion.
It's important to remember who your friends are.
This object is easily expanded.
Can you please tell me what you said?
I agree completely.
You go first.
Take us to the hospital.
I'm not your friend.
He's running.
I lost your phone number.
Get out of here!
Will you go fishing with us?
How old was he?
Tom's making me French.
It seemed cheap to see it.
Give me more water.
I love turning around.
I shouldn't have logged out.
Why?
Tom is fast asleep.
I know we still love each other.
Forgive me, I kept waiting for you.
What have you got?
Sit here.
There's a lot of shock at the hospital.
He's asking what it can do.
I asked them to send another ticket.
I can't believe it!
Tom will talk.
He explained the meaning of the phrase.
This is your fault.
Read it first.
How old is your father?
I saw that my mother was busy preparing some clothes.
How much did you eat?
I'm not your friend.
I'm not shouting.
What does that word mean?
Wait outside.
Can you take me to the Grand Hotel?
I'm not rejecting it.
The puzzle's fun.
They need friends.
Why don't you try to get your money back?
Tom got scared of Mary.
If he followed his doctor's advice, maybe he'd still be alive.
What is the purpose of your visit?
Tom French can read.
Ask Tom.
Don't yell!
Which next stop?
Why don't you come with us?

He's eating too much.
I'm a free man.
Tom lives there.
How can you stay calm?
Bangkok capital of Thailand.
Look down.
How old is the universe?
Someone came.
It's starting now.
He tried.
You're probably thinking about how I did it.
Don't stop.
Everyone saw it.
We're here too.
My name is Emily.
Where can I buy the book?
Do you know what he said?
That's embarrassing.
I'm just playing.
Call the hospital.
I can't find my wallets.
Let me talk to you.
Open the door.
We're here.
Ask Alex.
My father is going to China.
I didn't eat.
Tom's lying.
Don't remember us in any part.
I'll be back before midnight.
Come with me.
Move away.
Mary's very shy.
Where's the hospital nearby?
Where's the knife?
It was too evil.
I like black.
I rely on you.
Do you have any scissors?
I'm just kidding.
They screamed.
He's asking what it can do.
I forgot to call her today.
I saw him washed the car.
Tom left long breath.
It's smaller than me.
How long have you been in Boston?
How can I go to the station?
Tom thought he'd save him from the witch's hands.
It's easier to write about death than to write about life.
I heard you screaming.
He doesn't want to talk about this.
Don't leave me alone.
Please eat something.
He hasn't come yet.
My father's home.
Look, there's a cat in the kitchen!
I'm a student.
My dad's open.
I think you both know Tom.
How many nights do you have?
I didn't say anything.
You should ask her for advice.
I'm not a doctor.
Everyone was shouting.
Who's coming?
Faster, Tom.
We moved to South America.
What is your favorite television program?
They have guns.
My wallet is in Dickey.
You really don't work.

He's giving a speech.
What language do we speak in America?
I'm in English.
Let us in.
He was giving a speech.
He hasn't come yet.

I don't want you to go.
My father's busy.
It's already seven.
I was in Rome.
Come on.
I can put my hands on the ground without breaking my knee.
The police ordered us to leave.
You're a doctor.
Try to stay calm.
I'm very happy for Tom.
How old is he?
I don't think it's gonna rain tomorrow.
Can I get some tweel?
It's not always easy to do what's right.
How much do you leave the airport bus?
He can talk to French.
It's your key.
I can't.
A car jumped into Tom.
What a strange thing!
I don't want Tom to see me in that situation.
He can talk to French.
It's a tragedy to remain alone that nobody is talking about.
Have you ever been Boston?
It's a bad sign.
You can study here.
I'll call them tomorrow.
Come in two minutes.
I know Tom's tired.
I want some money.
Tom's dead.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
I'll take care of it.
No one knew me in Boston.
Contact Tom.
It's snowed all night.
Which floor is that?
I need a taxi tomorrow evening.
I heard you breathing.
I don't see you.
I don't understand what you're saying.
How much time do you go to sleep?
You have to do something very fast about this.
I've got 1.100 in the day.
It's past midnight.
Please don't hold the voice.
Are you crazy?
They're making sense.
Turn left.
I hit Tom.
The library left.
What does that word mean?
Mary's laughing.
I'm learning English.
Eat what you like.
No doubt.
Children like cake.
Tom Jackson is your real name?
Tom's dead.
Tell me what you need.
I haven't found my contract letter yet.
Tom was afraid of dog.
Tom saw him.
Your bike is like my bike.
Why do you want to go today?
Sit down.
Be careful to drive.
I see TV.
Don't cry.
Tom wanted you to take it.
What did you bring?
He told me he'd go to Venice.
Listen to me.
Can you take a breath?
He's smaller than me.
I don't speak Japanese.
We're both right.
Tom slept outside.
Sit down.
Don't worry about me.
It's past midnight.
What happened?
I agree with you.
How much does it cost?
How can they forget us?
I understand your situation.
I'm not Tom.
What a joke!
My book is here.
I'm Tom's wife.
I'm not too busy right now.
Where are you going on Monday?
They're screaming.
Tom Jackson wrote three books.
Tom told me that today.
I don't want to go to Boston.
Your answer is wrong.
I know.
I'm just kidding.
I'm not proud of it.
Let's run.
The train came in time, so we didn't wait for it.
I'm not your friend.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Come with me.
Is that your new girlfriend?
You can write in any language. All languages are equal in Tatobe.
I gave up, no matter what I do, I never feel satisfied to see you.
He can come.
He's an important person.
The train stopped at all stations.
I didn't care.
I didn't get caught.
Where's the mistake?
I can't attend the meeting.
It's a doctor.
I'm going to next station.
Are you a doctor?
I'm eating now.
You should ask him for advice.
Mark was moved from Harbatt in 1991.
My son knows the watch.
I'm looking for a nice hotel.
I'm a woman.
I'll be back in ten days.
Don't mess yourself up.
I don't want to look at Tom.
He's a doctor.
Goodbye.
You look sick.
I want a guitar.
Do I have to save seats?
Is that blood?
Call me tomorrow.
Waiter, get some water for me.
Let's find out where Tom is.
My mother can play a very good piano.
Can you speak French?
We'll eat now.
We'll win.
I went to Rome.
Would you like to fill this form?
We've seen it.
I'm glad to see you again.
They don't care.
How old do you want to get married?
I was late to go to school.
Forgive Tom.
Who wanted to hurt Tom?
Now, no one believes in the dead.
Leave him.
I'm optimistic.
Tom kept shouting.
How are you doing?
He can talk to French.
How old is this church?
I want to go back to Australia before I finish my passport.
Sit right there.
You can go there.
I don't want to raise myself up for all of this.
How many nights do you have?
Is your husband at home?
This is Japanese.
Tom's running.
We love coffee.
Let's hear what Tom says.
Tom loves me.
What have you forgotten?
I live here.
Tom cried almost every day.
He cleaned up his room.
Tom brought it.
I like him.
I'll cook.
Can you please tell me again?
I'll be back in three hours.
I'm yours.
Take Tom to the hospital.
Hold my hand.
What could they forget about us?
Because you don't want to be alone.
Will you go shopping with me?
How old are you?
Don't go to the kitchen.
Call me tomorrow.
Sit where you want to.
Tom doesn't want to hear it.
We're Arab.
Tom's hurt.
Where are you?
Smile a little.
I lost your phone number.
Everyone's here.
Will you eat something?
I can swim.
There's nothing left in Frazie.
Nothing happened.
Everyone's lying.
I'm your friend.
Time's up.
Try again.
Have you ever eaten a chicken?
He's giving a speech.
I like him.
How long you are!
I did my job.
I want my hand.
I was.
My body doesn't look good.
Where he went, his dog followed him.
You're not a doctor?
I saw him running.
Tom is a boy's name and Mary's name is a girl.
Tom's messing up, right?
What's your name?
Let's get out of here.
How much is that worth?
Do what he says.
I think the train's delayed.
It's past midnight.
I have two partners.
Put it on.
No one's talking.
Tom's talking.
I'm walking.
What am I eating?
Keep Tom away from me.
What's your father's name?
I want some money.
Eat your milk.
The people of Madrid are weird.
People don't see a lot of yellow.
Let me know.
Tom likes chess.
I want you to come with me.

Tom was angry.
I don't like coffee.
Sit here.
Eat the leg!
I heard you screaming.
Call me.
Welcome.
I want to buy some cheese.
Call the doctor!
I'm not worried.
Is this site empty?
We won.
My brother is two years older than me.
Stop!
The hotel was created last year.
Eat everything.
I want my guitar.
Stop that woman.
What will you do tomorrow?
Don't talk.
You can write in any language. All languages in Tobeba are the same.
They're there.
It's his house.
Forty million people are called English as their first language.
This house is my colder.
Where can I buy food?
Leave him.
I forgot his name.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
Tom was with me all day.
How long will it take to get to the station?
Who ate?
Where can I buy tickets?
How old is your grandfather?
He could say Japanese.
How many numbers do we take to walk out of Waikiki?
I'm hurting my leg.

He's smaller than me.
Tom chocolate cake likes too much.
I'll go now.
Have fun.
I was late last night.
Did you get cold?
Eat what you want.
Don't call me.
Is that far from here?
Where's the boy?
How much time do you leave the train in New York?
I'm walking.
I like her.
Would you like to learn French?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
No one understands me.
Let's go.
A country in New York.
He's sleeping like kids.
Can you show me your boarding pass?
Can you please help me?
It's smaller than me.
Victory is never easy.
I'll arrange it.
Do you have time?
I thought you'd come.
Tom's very sensitive.
I'm busy.
You can go home now.
He's smaller than me.
I think Tom's good.
I'll go back to Australia in two days.
Tom told Mary that she was going to kill herself, but she didn't have the courage to do that.
Will you go fishing with us?
Although it's not bad for itself, in many cases, many have seen too much television.
You should ask him for advice.
I'll take him.
I'm cold.
I'm sorry.
I'm still your friend.
I can't believe I believed Tom.
Be careful.
My son can't count yet.
Look at the car.
I eat.
I don't want to go shopping alone.
How far is the station from here?
He was sick last week.
Tom jumped at the door, but no one went out.
He's a doctor.
Stop breathing.
I'm hurt.
Go to the hospital.
The ambassador is back.
Please continue the nine.
Break the pen.
Tom always keeps his word.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
I refuse.
Wait outside.
I want a taxi now.
Shut up.
Who is he?
It happened at least three times.
Tom wants me to go with him.
We'll try once!
Tom's tired.
Don't forget us.
Tom kept talking.
I'm on the south side of the north.
You look tired.
Tom kept me waiting all afternoon.
He's eating.
He was sick last week.
I'll see you next month.
We need to contact Tom's parents.
Where can I buy that paper?
I'll be back in seven days.
Is the heart too deep?
I was late.
Call Tom.
How much is the price?
Tom saw him.
How much time is your plane?
Tom's long, but not long like me.
He's my wife.
I'm not very good at swimming.
Where's the tourist office?
Don't go.
Your shoes are here.
He didn't tell me his name.
Okay, I'll see you later.
Will you stay here?
What happened?
$100 with empty tanks.
I'm not very good in French.
My father is going to China.
Can he speak French?
I want it.
I'm your friend, right?
Help me!
I'll help you.
I don't agree with him.
Call the police!
I was worried.
There's a cup on the table.
I'll be back in an hour.
I have to get off this ship.
That's Tom.
He hasn't come yet.
Kim just smiled.
I don't live in town.
Women change the world.
Let's hurry.
I don't want Tom to see me in this situation.
Tom started shouting.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
It'll cost you 3.30.
Start here.
We were waiting for them.
I like yellow.
Tom decided to keep a diary.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
I'm not your friend.
How old is he?
Come back.
Why are you shouting?
Can I get the check?
Do you have any bigger ones?
Tom comes from me twice.
I need it.
I think you don't need any help.
Tom waited outside the gate.
Don't wait.
Is the museum open today?
Don't wait.
Don't worry about me.
Shall we eat outside today?
Keep Tom away from me.
Tom's hurt.
He's scootered.
Is my London cup made?
Where can I buy it?
I need to send a fax.
He's eating too much.
He taught me to write.
Call my mommy.
I could play that song.
I was surprised.
Where's Boston?
Our calls.
The rules are easy.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
You're very good from me.
He hasn't come yet.
I can't lift my right hand.
I'm in the hospital.
Tom caught the thief.
Tom, I want to talk to Mary.
Do you understand me?
Tom was surprised when he heard that Mary was married to John.
Most of the success depends on efforts.
Tom is laughing.
Tom lost his head.
Were you born there?
Everyone knows it now.
I got my shoes.
I was surprised.
Do you have to walk this step?
Is there a black teeth?
The connection was disconnected.
Can I get a knife?
Have you ever broken your bones?
I want to go to next stop.
How are you?
I'll go to the dentist tomorrow.
I can't believe it!
Isn't it?
He hasn't come yet.
They're doctor.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
You ever ride the horse?
He was talking.
I have two brothers.
What's the matter with you?
I didn't have to say anything to Tom.
Try more.
Tom laughs.
Why are you sitting there?
What language is spoken in the United States?
I'm tired.
He has two daughters.
I want you to talk to Tom.
I'm your friend.
Follow Tom.
Tom always talks about him.
He's an expert teacher.
I think you both know Tom.
Tom's here.
Everyone wishes happiness.

Tell me what you want.
I don't know if it's time to do it.
Tom keeps his word.
I want you to call Tom.
Tom bought some Alu.
Tom has fallen.
You go first.
We all ate dinner.
Eskul will start tomorrow.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm not waiting.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Which floor is that?
Football is a game.
The sky is clear.
Nomesor!
I really appreciate your generosity.
He told me he'd go to Venice.
What's your phone number?
He's walking.
What does this mark mean?
The letter was written.
Stop here.
Tom saw you.
Come with me.
No, thanks.
Wait here.
Have I been too late?
Leave him.
I can't be right.
A language holo communication tool.
Tom knows that.
I've never heard of Tom.
How much time do you leave the next train for Tokyo?
Tom's taking a big risk.
Are they yours?
What are you talking about?
I'll work.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You're rich.
Will you go to America next month?
I don't want to swim.
I'm not owner.
Thank you very much.
He hasn't come yet.
I'm sorry!
I want to tell you how much I want to say.
Snow reflects a lot of sugar.
Come out.
They screamed.
I ran away from home.
We made pancakes for breakfast.
Don't you have a bike?
I don't know if he's coming.
You're shouting.
He's Sequential.
He doesn't want to talk about this.
Everyone saw it.
I'll feed my cat every morning and morning.
My son came home.
I'm a student.
I'll be there.
Do you have your passport?
Please give me my voice.
Do what he says.
It's too tired to see you.
Tom started shouting.
Sit there.
I wasn't alone.
I've learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom always keeps his word.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We saw them.
Today is June 18, and today Muriel's birthday.
Who won?
Come on, let's get ready.
We have to tell Tom to do this for us, don't we?
Can these reverts be found in the stilt?
I'm going to Osaka Station.
I don't think Tom is responsible for this.
Someone's a kkalo.
I went to the bakery.
I learned to live without him.
My father is very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Let's hurry.
Tom was busy with work.
I'm not proud of the way I used to.
I'm breathing.
We'll work.
He's here.
I don't agree with him.
Come to me.
I'm breathing.
My hand doesn't work properly.
Forget Tom.
What courage!
Is this the book of Tom?
He was angry.
Who are you?
I could have died.
Are you sure?
Now we have to go.
He ignores education.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
They eat healthy food.
My mother loves music.
He's gonna warm his head easily.
Wherever he goes, his dog goes behind him.
Who is this?
Can I work here?
There's still a problem.
It's my nose to collect old bottles.
I like the painting.
I don't want to go.
When will you leave the next bus?
What does that mean?
You don't have a bike?
Do you want to come?
My mother could play very good golf.
He knows where we live.
I know your name.
Tom's not here.
What did you say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom stopped screaming.
How old is Tom?
Come on, come on!
Stop breathing.
Was Tom there?
I've been bleeding this afternoon.
My back is still suffering.
Where's Tom?
They look like American.
You were the only friend to Tom.
I went to the hospital.
I accepted his invitation.
My father can drive a good car.
I'll be alone.
You need a friend.
Forget about Tom.
I think Tom said his successor Jackson.
You knew Tom for a long time from me.
I know.
I'm playing football now.
My wallet hasn't arrived yet.
Tom's not here yet.
Please wait until he comes.
Tom's at least speaking to him.
Eat something.
Is there anyone at home?
What are you doing?
I think Tom's good.
Where do I get the Stamp?
I'm going to breathe.
Can he speak French?
Tom would like to take it.
We love our country.
Is he a doctor?
Would you like a little more?
And one day he left.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friends.
Stop that woman.
How old is that church?
Ask me tomorrow.
It's still mine.
Where would I call my wallet?
We do whatever we want.
Tom is right.
I ran to my mother.
This book is for students who are not Japanese.
Tom wanted to be the minister.
Who would you trust?
He's a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I deserve.
Nobody's wrong.
Do you live here?
Everybody else laughing.
How long will you stay?
Have you seen the man in this picture?
I lost my wallet.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want to wake Tom.
My son is paying money.
The sky seems to start snow tonight.
How much does it cost?
You know what Tom wants.
We'll dance.
I can't stop Kashi.
I just want Tom to be happy.
Those who live in the mud shouldn't be rocked.
Why are you shouting?
Stop Tom.
I think I should go to the hospital.
Tom wants his roof back.
Is Tom at home?
Tom always keeps his word.
I'm drunk.
I'm your friend.
How long have you been?
Who's here?
The city is divided into a river east and west.
Come and see yourself.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I have to go to sleep.
You got a car?
Tom's playing the guitar.
You're thinking about doing something now?
He's having lunch now.
Can you keep watch on Tom?
You should ask him for advice.
This tooth hurts.
How much do they have?
How much more should I pay for?
Everyone liked Tom.
What happened here?
Here's your key.
Are you Japanese?
Let's hurry.
Eat whatever you like.
Take this.
Have you ever broken your bones?
He was angry.
We learned English.
I couldn't stand my right leg.
I'm dry.
How old are you?
Can I ask you a question?
What's that?
Here's your key.
We saw more bad things.
Help Tom.
I'm almost sure.
What's that?
He's eating.
He likes the googesh Gaza.
You didn't understand.
My mother is hurting me.
Sit at the table.
He's smaller than me.
What's your name?
We're waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
Can I use credit card?
It's too big at night, isn't it?
This book is only found in French.
Tell me.
I'll take him.
Can I buy a credit card?
Tom found my bike.
I went home to Jackson's house.
He put a black hat on it.
Anything else?
Everyone's breathing.
Is there any excuse for students?
I eat noodles.
Tom's in the house.
Don't ask what they think they're doing.
Will you come in?
I'll tell you.
We like football games.
What are you gonna eat?
Good evening.
He eats empty fruit.
These shoes want a new suit.
Everyone liked Tom.
Who's that?
I'm still your friend.
Enjoy.
Please listen!
He's running.
I'll cut my breath tomorrow.
My right hand hurts.
My father was busy.
Everybody's ready to go.
I couldn't hold the 700th train.
He had two daughters.
This is my wife.
Let's talk.
Do you have a pane?
The class won't start before eight and a half hours ago.
How much time do you spend lunch in that?
What does that word mean?
How much do I get?
Can you say English?
It's wrong what they did.
My son is taller than me.
Tom's parents were singer.
Here's your problem.
Tom's alive.
He's seen in the focus.
Answer me.
This bag is mine.
Tom was angry.
How much is it worth?
You can eat as much as you want.
Let go.
I'm a little hot.
Can you speak French?
He's a doctor.
Fill it up.
How old are you?
Hold on to Tom.
They're making sense.
You're shouting.
I don't think it's gonna rain tomorrow.
I'll be back when I finish.
I like glowing.
He grew up in France.
He didn't work on Sunday night.
He taught me to write.
Happy birthday!
It's not your book, it's mine.
Twelve people were killed.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
Tom's father is a pig.
Listen.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
It's a time.
I never make a mistake.
Where's the pickup door at UA11?
I'm broken.
Why are you laughing?
Tom wants his roof back.
Where do you usually go to sleep?
Two countries have established a deal between themselves.
I speak with Tom empty French.
Tom got eyes on him.
Can you put it on the gifette?
Tom's in the garage now.
What did you forget?
I really don't want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He's laughing.
He hasn't come yet.
It's not mine.
Who came?
He's eating fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
Terrorists left the prisoners.
I could have gone with you, but I didn't have time.
I lost my wallet.
He's a good man.
We did it.
The government's hacked.
Get out of town!
Count as long as Tirish.
He's eating.
How old was that church?
Let's go!
This is Japanese.
Have you seen her out of the way?
How much do you leave the toilet bus for the airport?
Don't fight.
That's my cat.
That bag is mine.
I have an old computer that I don't need anymore.
I've got my test.
We walked on foot.
I want it.
I need those papers.
Tom screamed.
Tom laughs very low.
Eat what you want.
Tom's crying.
How much is it worth?
I'm fine.
They're doctor.
It's time for the plane to be right.
I don't know what you mean.
Most of the audience were businessmen.
Turn right.
Tom's probably sleeping.
I've got a lot of shit.
Tom won a lot of running.
He knows where we live.
I learned a lot from Tom.
Tom Alu dust.
Everyone was shouting.
I'll stay out.
My mother can cook well.
They're making sense.
The study was successful.
I think Tom will have little chance to keep the gold he found.
Boston is a big city.
Me, too.
Here's your key.
Let's talk about Tom.
Eat your milk.
The name of both of us is Tom.
They were all happy.
Is this your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who broke the flowers?
Tom's hurt.
Follow the back of Tom.
Is Tom still angry at me?
Tom has fallen.
We're waiting for you.
I'm not perfect.
Do you know what he said?
Listen carefully.
We've made a lot of mistakes.
Why are you shouting?
What's your father's name?
Look over there.
Tell me if I do something.
We tried.
Tom resigned on October.
The market's next to the doctor's.
Happy Canada Day!
I'll be late.
What is the meaning of this sign?
Tom didn't lose his head.
Are we ready?
I like Tom Blue Anchors.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen carefully.
Will you go shopping with me?
Slow down.
They're there.
I'll kiss you.
Everybody's tired.
Don't give me a date.
Who was it?
I'm Lazuak.
When I said that Mary left the city, Tom was really surprised to see Tom left.
I heard the screams.
How much time is your plane?
I don't want to talk about it.
I thought my book was interesting.
Tell me what happened.
I'm up today at 8 o'clock.
Please burn the light.
Tom's hurt.
I'm still your friend.
Some pages took me more than two hours to translate English.
Are these yours?
Who is he?
Is this the smallest road to the station?
Tom tried to kill Mary.
What do you know about him?
It's impossible!
When did the train reach Yokomah?
What time is it?
The words that will not correct the right words can be added to more common translations instead.
Your shoes are here.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
Has anyone left any news for me?
I want to cook for you.
Listen to me, is this train going to Washington Square?
We failed.
There's Essie in this house.
Did you wear the whole thing?
Tom Boston's gone.
Say it clearly.
Don't open it.
Tom saw him.
It could be snow in the evening.
I'm not proud of him.
Is anyone there?
I'm wrong.
I'm not young anymore.
He's eating.
It's just blood.
Will you go fishing with us?
Wait right here.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
Wait a minute.
Tom's hurt.
Mary explained.
I'm not rejecting it.
Don't see!
End it as soon as possible.
Use it.
When did the train reach Yokomah?
I don't understand that either.
I've got seven in the morning.
I'm at home.
Let's go slowly.
Happy Christmas!
I went inside.
Me too.
I'm not too busy.
It's wonderful.
Do it again!
Tom started in the kitchen.
They're kids.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why don't you go?" "Why don't I go."
I know it.
I'll stay close.
Call me tomorrow.
Tell me what you want.
I'm hurting my leg.
Ask Tom.
I'm thinking about what I'll give you in the birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
Nice to see you again.
Why are you shouting?
Stay right there.
Eat the food that you like.
We played park.
I'm busy.
Where can I buy tickets?
I've done my job.
I'm planning to stay at the hotel.
I finally got my keys.
Tom started shouting.
I'm not arguing.
Can you read?
How old is your father?
Are you okay?
I've never seen Tom's happiness from this.
Don't get in there.
We're lost.
Tom's laughing.
We can still do that.
I tried.
I'm sick.
I see it empty, thank you.
Unfortunately it's true.
We were waiting for them.
How old do you look at me?
Tom is not happy here.
It's angry.
I don't like coffee.
Speak slowly.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to meet Tom?
Here you go.
We don't care what he does.
I called my good friend Tom.
We can never play better than this.
We're Lazuak.
The bill will be given today.
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know it's not right.
Eat what you like.
I have wine.
Why did Tom cry?
