Walsh AMs worry about ‘ staring like fools ’
In some AMes, their definition of MWPs (the members of the WWPs) should be found because they are allowed to be changed.
This is born because the name of the Assembly has been changed into the Walsh Parliament.
The entire political scene is worried that this could cause them to forget.
A labAM said their group is upset that his voice is met with Tup and Pwp.
For readers out of the Wells: twp in Walsh means crazy and pwp.
One pladeAM said their group was together as "no interest" and suggested the alternative.
A Welsh Conservative said that their group has a "international mind" about the change of name, but said that there's a short silence between MWP and madness.
In this setting, Welsha is described as the English letter of Yak Sharer.
The Assembly Committee that is preparing legal procedures to introduce the name at this time said: "No words that will be said to be addressed to the members of the assembly must be decided personally."

Rams seems to suggest alternative options, but the projecting officer Alan Jones may be a painful head of opinion, who is expected to collect legal information about the changes within weeks.
There are also other changes in the way the assembly work is organized by legalists, including the dissident and committee designer of AMs.
AMs will discuss the matter with which they should be called.

The promotional Liangston surprised Rangers by winning the winner and led the second defeat in 18 games as the director of Oxford Club.
David Mangala's staff was different, while Gary Holt's team was equal to the Habibrinian team.
The team of Gerrard's team in this series is without any win in the Prime Ministership, and the next Sunday will be against Hertz, which is behind eight points.
Before this, Rangers will play for Wednesdays against the Rapid Vienna in the European League.
The Confucianism has taken his freedom to six games in Lungston Dion, and Hend Coch Hollt has not been a victim since the last month of the year.
The Chinese are few against Lungston's condenses.
The Holt's team should have taken the first first step before the hacker's team, while their co-founder had solved Rangers all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke the brakes, but his aim was to get up to the bomb level, and Alan Lethro was able to extend himself more and more before he found himself faced with a rampage from the Kreg Halock.
The host team was satisfied with allowing Rangers to play with them, knowing that they could put the lawyers into trouble in the seat Passes.
And that's how the most important round came into existence.
Ringers provided a free cake and started when Dexan and Galagger faced the Arranger Manga, who was able to pull through the center of the box.
By the end of this period, the Rangers' position was in position, but they found that the security of the host team was unconstitutional and that the golf-Creation Killer caliber has a permanent application.
It's the same thing that Peter continued in the second week, if Alexander Alferdio Mourelos received a video from Kelly.
Scott Patmen was missing the Galen McGregor of Rangers, and Lithegoro took a shot away from Leungston's list.
In Lungston's office, there were a class with Tussel and a class with a pencil, while just two invitations were made to meet the alternative Glenalton, and those who were rejected were rejected.
Livingston's 'a small' analysis.
Alice Deer Lamont of the BC Scott Island in Tony McKinney, Arizona
An extraordinary performance and result for Livingstone.
For a man, they were powerful, who were doing more than constant expectations in the highest journey.
The style and team members of their games have changed little since their arrival, but the real reward goes to the hotel who has built the team up after his arrival.
There's a lot of heros.
Captain Hocket has won the victory, who was managed with the most beautiful defense when Mangala placed on the fives during the game.
However, he wasn't zealous in Rangers.
As best they're following the leadership under Gerrard, they're not able to meet those standards.
They didn't have control on the ball and could just start against hosters -- and it's a threat to Rangers while they're in the middle of the terror table.

From Lake Titicaca to Amazonon, it reads: "We have the right to justice."
"It's our duty to get back."
The memory of a 19th-century river in Bolivia is still fresh - and to travel across the Pacific Ocean in the 19th century.
Now these wishes are on my top level in several days, while Bolivia has been working for five years, waiting for an international justice decision on October 1.
A Bolivian professor, Roberto Caldjadala, said that Bolivia has power, unity and unity, and a positive outlook.
In many cities of Bolivia, many people will see the decision of IICJ in large urban areas, hoping that in Hague, there will be a decision to decide whether to call the Tribunal Bolivian Bolivia's call, after several of the revolutionists said that it was responsible for the decision to lead to the sea.
The president of Bolivia's microbiology, Evo Moralis, also had to make a lot of effort to make the Monday decisions.
They were determined to show that their country is very close to the Pacific Ocean.
But some researchers believe that the court will not be able to decide for Bolivia - and if it does, it won't change much.
There is no right to hand them over to the United Nations Court of Human Rights in Holland, and he has decided that he will not determine the result of possible discussions.
In the International Law, a lecturer said that ICJ's decision was only six months after the last criminal was heard.
Rather than promote Bolivia's objective, maybe the last four years have affected it.
Shashi said that the current administration of Bolivia has hacked the issue of access to the ocean.
He said, “The governor has demanded a great deal of controversy among us.
Bolivia and Chile can continue to talk for some time, but then debate will be very difficult.
Both countries haven't changed the security since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez, who represented Bolivia in Hague, has rejected the idea that the decision of justice was an unusually fast.
He said it's a unique opportunity to start a new relationship with Chile on Monday and end the number-time agreement for each other.
Caldilla rejected the fact that Muralis, who are still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, is using the sea problem as a political weapon.
He also said, "To Bolivia will never be able to access his right to the Pacific.
The court's decision is an opportunity to highlight the need to forget the past.
North Korea: Anti-Correction does not accept arms without trust in America
Their country will never be armed with nuclear weapons when she does not trust Washington.
Representing the United Nations General Assembly on Sunday.
They demanded that the U.S. leaders of both countries fulfill their promises to the head of the country in Singapore.
Their impressions have come in such a time when the US Ministers' Outlets are going to re-response the North Korea's low angle after three months of meeting with them.
He said that the U.S. response to the announcement to end the war in the ban would force the U.S. North Korea to slow down.
The interview with Washington Pong is careful not to announce it without the intervention of the armed forces.
At least and US President Donald Trump wants to meet the other head.
But the vast amount of doubt is that Pyong Yang is serious about the use of weapons that he considers the only security of his peace.
The next month, the puppys want to visit the other head of the trip between the pipes and the trip.
The Paris Operation show the head of the big size in the show.
If you want to expand your hats or stop the sun completely, don't wait anymore.
Designers Valentine and Tham Browny have displayed the large size of their SS19 college on the runway which has impressed the style style in Paris's press platform.
In this summer, there was a total of installments on the atmosphere, and these designers sent their powerful workers to Kate Wick.
The most prominent of the five-footed birds on the Walnuts of the Walnuo, were the hat of the tall seed, which was covered with the head of the model's heads.
In other larger sizes, the jaguar hats, the magic hat and an inn shape - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Tham also showed the election of the first-class masks - which was presented at the time of Anna Hollon.
There were so many colorful Brunei masks, and they were looking at Hannibal Lecter rather than modern fashions.
One of them was like a jackes and a sacrackling car, while another look like a melting ice cream.
And if you continue to describe the function, you're lucky.
It's predicted that a large number of bats are going to be beautiful next to you.
The head of large size came after the "Labobo" attacks, which were two feet wide, and each one was watching from Riana to Emily Night.
Behind this extremely unconstitutional hat, a group label that spread across the entire social media has brought another big change in Kate Wick - the beach bag that is almost as large as your suit has been raised.
JOMOMUS La Rivra SS19 was one of the most vivid colors on the walls of the Republic of Rio de Janeiro.
The SCIAL STATIST told FEMOL: I expect the arrival of big ships in big markets for the next summer – because the designer has left so much a great impact on the demand of large size.
John Edward: Skills of the Language for Global Citizens
The School of Education in Scotland kept track of the free school intelligence and the record continued with excellent test results in 2018, which has been strengthened by international and international success in sports, music, and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students in all Scottland, this school is represented by the School of State of Endpoint Schools (SCIS), trying to provide students and parents the best level of service.
Free schools prepare their students for the next and higher education, their chosen careers and global citizens.
As a school section of education prepared and able to apply it, we see modern languages inside schools as a popular and favorite article.
Nelson Mandela said: If you talk to someone in a language he understands, he goes into his head.
If you speak with him, he speaks with your tongue, then he becomes deeply rooted in his heart.
It is an admonition that we cannot depend on the English just to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
With the results of this year's recent exams, we can see the language in free schools with the highest rate of access to the League cables.
68 percent of students who read foreign languages have received high grade grade A.
According to 72 percent of German readers, 72 percent of the students read French and 63 percent of Spanish readers also received an AID.
It shows that free schools in Scotland as well as foreign languages contribute to important skills that children and young people need in the future.
The language is now the same as STM articles (Synss, Technology Engineering and Research) in the United States.
A survey from U.S. Department of Labor and Industrialities in 2014 found that 17 percent of the languages' skills have been reduced in due time for the difficulties to fill free states.
So the language skills of young people are becoming more sophisticated in preparing for their future career.
These skills are needed in today’s world as many as possible for more work opportunities.
No matter how the purchases of the purchase, if someone has learned another language, they will have real benefit in the future because of having a skill like this kind of life.
Having been able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, Hadi takes the lead in comparing a rare person.
According to YuGoovovo Po, more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent of British adults were unable to speak a foreign language to communicate well and French is the only language spoken by the two males, which is about 15 percent.
That's why today’s children need to spend money on reading language.
Many languages, as well as special development conditions, increase the chances of finding a good job for children.
In Scotland, each school has a different language.
Many schools focus on more modern languages, while others teach languages that are the most important concept for Britain by 2020, such as Mandiran or Japanese.
Any of your child's favorites, you'll always be able to choose several languages in free schools and be a master teacher in this field.
Scotts are determined to provide free schools to provide educational environments that prepare and prepare children for future success
In the present world business environment, it cannot be rejected that languages are very important to the future of the country, so it should be displayed in the art of education.
Of course, modern languages should be seen as "new international communications skills."
This will continue to be the choice for young people of the Free School School of Scottland.

Time of West Virginia Reli, YouTube Channel
President Trump is starting a series of selections from Yelling in West Virginia tonight.
This is the first of five trains for the next week of the Trump, which includes some of the friendly local residents of Bashamol Tennessee and Mississippi.
Because of the fall of the Supreme Court to monitor the empty state of the Court's election, Trump is seeking public support for mid-time elections because the Republicans have been threatened to lose their control over the elections in November.
When is the night of West Virginia's night, and how can you see it online?
On September 29, 2018, it will be September 29, 2018.
You can see online online via the Live Station on the Wrive YouTube of Tampe's West Virginia.
It is likely that a person whose reputation for Tampe Super Court will talk about this week's hearing for Bret Kawon that has been embarrassed by the charges of sexual immorality and has been registered for a week's study of FBI for a week.
But the main purpose of the train is to help the Republicans move to the election of November.
Thus, the President Trump's electoral campaign has reported that the goal of these trains is to "teachers and supporters" in the next week while the publishers are trying to save and expand their majority in Representatives Cent and Eun delegations."
A translation of Trump's electoral campaign who refused to show the name to the delegates told them that "Keep control over Congress on Congress" is so important that we will visit as many as possible countries as possible.
According to West Virginia Metor News, today's entry into Vietnam will gather allies from Wavenko and Pennsylvania tonight and will receive media coverage."
The second time of the week's visit will be the second time that Trump visited West Virginia, it's state where he succeeded over 40 percent of the points in 2016.
The West Virginia Republicans are trying to help Peter Marisi who are behind the election police.
According to estimates, a political scientist Simon Hyder at West Virginia University said that it is not a good sign for Marisi that they are going to come to the president to bring up the police."

After the three-week sessions, this radder was the life of the driver at the end of the week than shoes.
The amount of moving pandus is a complete concept of play, but a concept that believes in the player's heart, and that will never happen as much as they do.
Then they will say: "What is the matter with you?"
On that day, Jordan Street said, "They got six points high, and now they're four, so I think we're going to take it a little bit as much as we're doing."
Of course, Europe is gaining prominence, along with four points, while they can try to get the bar further.
As Smith said, the U.S. people feel that their minds are still being restored and there is enough to hope for them, but as with special airports and jet Thomas who were playing around the whole day and each got three points.
They've set an example about putting the ball into the hole and they've set up an example.
When their rounds went up, the tricks grew high when they put the ball into the hole with a little bit of a bit of a little bit and put it in the hole four-- in a time when Thomas and two Pointes followed the two points.
Their golf was so happy when they took them to the 15th time, as the U.S. team told you that the U.S. team had not yet come out of competition.
Says Smith that you just have to work hard for your taste and worry about it.
It's just that every one of these players has been gone.
There are 18 hotels left on the road.
In the last two days, the only player that gets the tops of the flag was Francesco Minnari and Tommy flat, who is a member of the Red Cup.
Europe's team is surprised, but this amazing couple is perfect and they don't expect to be wrong.
The only couple of "little Woods" who didn't shoot a single shot on the weekend, but they saved up mornings, Friday afternoons and again in the morning.
It's the way their energy moves from the noise of the storm-players and to them makes sure that they're the only players that will be able to fit on Sunday and have no fun playing with them, except for the filming of the European team, which is possible to ensure the victory of European team.
Both of them are very different at different hotels.
The words of Europe's great and awey history have been long ago, yet.
Bob Watsons and Web Simpson did their job immediately when his shoe was with Alex Norone.
A bottle in the first nine cells and two doubles threw Spanish and Swedish couple into a hole where they could never come out.
Sunday, of course, there's no one to help you get out of the hole.
Among the girls who give advice, which they don't give and the advice they don't give in a moment, which makes sense to look beautiful to see the morning hair and afternoons.
So far, Europe's team has displayed a good game as a team and has kept its dignity until the last day but has shown that the formative system has also been encouraged to fight in the TMASA, which some people are seriously doubting.
The last day of Europe is 10-6.
The last day of the United States is 10-6th day of the European Reedership after getting a 10-6 rise on the day of the holiday on the United States.
Tommy Westwood and Francisco Kamniary's pro-tweet team started with two independent forces at the challenge and took her to four points in Le Golf Nationals until now.
Thomas Byron's European team, who has been trying to keep his trip in Hezalton two years ago, was on the American team on the U.S. team in the morning contests and from 3-1.
The U.S. contested more resistance and won two MacHs, but the loss was not complete.
Jim Fork's team needs eight pints in 12 forty-three matches to maintain traffic.
The first stopovers of the Westwood European team were the players who received four pints while their crew was with their actors, which was the beginning of a "small Wood", which was the first player in the history of a Sansie Week and Reedop, which took four minutes in their first four minutes.
After conducting Woods and Patrick Reddington in Fows, they have the best way to get together to the best of the country's defeater Woods and US blockage, Brian Dambio, the highest of 5–4.
Wods, who managed to succeed in two minutes in two minutes, exhibited the ideal beauty and talent, but they have lost 19 of the 29th of the 29th of their art cats and Forces and seven of them.
Justin Day, who spent the morning's time at the Forbes competition, returned with Hansen Johnson and Brooks, who were the first and third of the World Rackings.
Europe’s team of teams in the south of Paris did not agree on a pleasant and fast day.
Three times the chief champion of championship Jordanship and Justin Thomas set a standard for Americans with two points on the weekend.
He won a victory at Spain's death path and onionports in force and later defeated Paul and Macmillan after two open hotels lost two weeks in force.
In the history of Ridder Cup, only once a team went back to the game after four points have been lost in the game, but the team's team had just to be equal to just to keeping track.
After being on the second number for two days, it seems that the answer attack will be out of their reach.
North Korea says that without trust, "it doesn't make sense" is entirely unconstitutional.
The Prime Minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday Day that their trust in the United States has been betrayed by their country's trust in the United States and that their country has not been in such a state that their country is in a unique position to support its nuclear weapons.
Reging Ho told the General Assembly of the World Organization that the North Korea has been carrying “the last year’s final mention of Singapore”, such as preventing Etami and Mesal tests, removing the position of the Atoms and Etami testing, and preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and electronic technology.
He said, but we don't see the reaction from America.
There will be no trust in our national peace without having to trust in America, and in any case, we will not be united in any case.
While Ryre repeated the charges of Washington against the "Rassharing" intelligence of the Department of State's Department of Defense, the report shows that he has not completely rejected the one-known description of the armed struggle, as he has been doing in the past.
On June 12, 2012, the U.S. President of the United States and the leader of North Korea quoted the first direct visit to the United States and North Korea after meeting him, which promised to try to "clean the Korean border with the United States's Armed Forces" while Trump promised peace.
North Korea wants to end the legal battle of the Korean War of 53-1950, but the United States says that Pyong Young will have to break down his nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted strong international restrictions on North Korea.
Says Rey, the U.S.A. focuses on the "first-facted anti-the-century" weapon, and in general the pressure increases through the ban for its purpose, and says that "the declaration of the end of the war" is also counterable.
The idea that restrictions can force us to slow down and think of a bad idea of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that restrictions are increasing in the number of confidence.
Rei has no mention of the second head meeting between low and Trump, which the US president has already enrolled in the United States prior to this.
Instead, the Prime Minister mentioned three visits between the leader of South Korea and the leader of South Korea in the past five months and added: "If the problem of the attack was not settled in South Korea, the U.S. would not be determined by the U.S.
Nevertheless, Rie's speech was different from the last year's speech, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that "Mister Devil President" was called "the man of a suicide mission" on the North North Korea's Republic.
Trump who had threatened North Korea last year to "communicately" this year, but he said that there's still a lot of work left and should be maintained by North Korea.
Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.
China and Russia have the reasoning that the United Nations should pay the bill for the benefits of the Peace Council of Peace.
However, the US secretary-in-law told the US Security Council of International Affairs on Friday: "Peace Council bans must continue until we have complete, confirmed, and confirmed-fashioned military purposes."
Peace Council has expanded the ban on North Korea in 2006 with the opinion that it has been blocked by the government for the Pung Yang Yang and Bisili Messal programs.
Papio met Rey at the United Nations General Assembly's Sidelines and then told that they would visit the next month to prepare the meeting for the second head meeting.
Papio has visited North Korea three times this year before, but their last visit has not been good.
He went out of Pong Yang in July, but after just a few hours, North Korea condemned them for "cows like dogs."
North Korea promised me an easy way to make an appointment with me this month and an anti-technology company if the United States takes "acts" in the United States.
He told them that the "actions" which they want to do are a guarantee of peace in which Trump promised to take action in Singapore and to take steps to make contact with Washington.
The Harvard School is involved in a considerable amount of sleep at the hospital
The Harvard University has encouraged all of its students to get to sleep under a new course this year under a new course so that with the aid of Caffen, they can cope with the tradition of increasing maleization.
A teacher discovered that students in the first number of countries of the world are often unaware of how things are most important.
Dr. Howard Medical School professor and professor of mental medicine at the Harvard Medical School, and a Specialist Charles Ceciller in Haam and Humans Hospital, says that this is the first course they have had in the United States.
After giving a talk on the lack of sleep on the study process, they were moved to start the course.
He told Silly Griff, ‘When this is over, a girl came to me and said, ‘I’m telling you why, when I’m in my senior year?’
He told me that no one ever told him about the importance of sleeping - a fact that made me wonder.
This course, which starts this year, explains how good sleep habits contribute to education and play activities, and makes them better.
Paul Brera, professor of mental disorders at Harvard Medical School and editor of University’s health care, said that the university decided to introduce students to sleep during the week.
A series of common taxis in an hour-long course involves a series of hours course.
In a lecture, there's a picture of the hospital room, which affects the effects of cancer and light, and that's how the lack of sleep affects the performance of the lack of sleep and clicks on enough clothes, clothes, cars, and books to learn about the importance of sleeping habits.
In another interview, participants are told how long a long time of sleep increases the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map part of the campus with the corresponding figures encourages us to think about their daily routines.
Paul Sesler added, we know that this doesn't change immediately.
But we understand that they have the right to know-- exactly as you're supposed to know about the effects on your health when you're choosing cigarettes.
He is still proud of the "corruption" and adds that modern technology and constant pressure on the college mean a growing problem.
He said, "Make sure you sleep very well enough to cope with stress, stress and stress - that to avoid obesity - means to avoid the lack of sleep, put the mind in hunger mode, which keeps you hungry forever.
A 19-year-old student of California, Raymond So, who is studying chemical and medical sciences, helped Professor Paul Ceciller in preparing his studies last year.
She told him that the course opened her eyes and made her peace to try to start a course in the camp.
He expects the next month to complete the same education program before joining all the postgraduate students in the former Soviet Union.
Professor Sesler suggests that students should be aware of when to go to bed and when they should be awake and they should be aware of the effects of the electronic sclerosis and LED lighting of light.
Victory at Livingston: Manga gave the Gorge player's players the ball.
Reynerzs was another shock when one of the times of Duley Mangg's non-ward team was defeated by a poll of Stephen Gerrard's non-profits in Lington.
The Abrook team at St. Johnston was looking for its first victory record in February 4-1, but the team of Gary Holt's team at 18 games put its second suspect on the British General Gerrard, and his team took its team away from every eight seats.
Mangaa rose seven minutes ago, and the Rangers team was never hurt by it.
Now Rangers are on the sixth number, Lyingstone has hung on the third number and is just behind the Hobbitins.
There may be more problems for Gerrard when he seems to have hit his head by throwing something on the surface.
Gerrard made eight changes in his team, which led to a series of series of autopsys.
On the other hand, the hotel was the same with Livi 11. who introduced a point from Harates last week and was happy to see that he turned around to the enemy's face.
Perhaps the Rangers were able to live, but Lungston kept the ball in his control.
They've only been able to hack within two minutes when the first time in Manga's game was opened, so St. Patman gave up on the ball of Gold Allen McGee, but the Middlefield saved time.
By the distance of Kangon Jacobbes, Frank Kreig was reached, but his defense Partyer Alan Lethog was able to throw down only the bank posts.
Rangers must have got control on the game, but in the last third part, they could only be expected to be sure about their game.
Alfredo Murlous must have felt that he found a penetration on Mark for the fourth hour of his fourth hour when there was a breach between him and Stéunion Lalis, but the Republic of Colombia rejected the Apports of Colombia.
Ringers could just hit only two shots in Haif, but the former governor of Abrovox did not have to deal with Lasan Kobali's head of Colombia and the weak shot of Ovijaria.
While Liv could be against the open game in 34 minutes, no one can deny that it was their original need.
Once again Regener's attempt to solve Jacobbs' scheme failed.
Scott didn't find the time to react when Délán Galleph cast a ballot to Robinson, and he chose to stop his plan with a calm heart.
In the break, Gerrard changed Rein Kent's place of Columbia and the change showed an immediate effect when Nurger Gallos ran off his line to stop him.
But Liangston continued to force the guests to play their favorite games when Leogo and Hallet were playing long shots.
The Holt's team could have increased its lead in the final phase when Lithegio threw him to Hend Jabes, but McGregor failed their efforts in the way.
Glendolton, the alternative for Rangers, claimed a penetration when he broke up with Jacobs, but Thomas ignored it.
COOPE: AGGRAPHERO
And now a page from "day's morning" to 136 years ago, counting from now on, on September 30, 1882, created in Germany.
Gorg prepared a way to carry and measure up the production process, which was a product which eventually led to a series of audiocatheters.
It's not only science but even the pop class, as it is seen in the 1950 "Bills of Corrowdio" where scientists with unusually unlikely experts say Rogers and Del Einz:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "This is a singer counter, which is used to carry out the economics of uranium.
When you take these applications, you can actually listen to the effects of anti-retroviral drugs produced in a relatively short period of time."
Evans: "Yes, it's really popping!"
"Huns" Gorg died in 1945 a few days before his 63th year.
But his theory with his name is still alive.
The new VNC system of cancer can train cells to “see ” the cells.

SNL started with Met Damm, which started with a cycle in which the Holy Woods Star was ridiculed by Christine Blasi Fod, against the court of Bret Quano's court.
Although it wasn't the broadcaster, she was released on social media by Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock wants to explain the West through this post.
Also, West has complained that he had to face difficult times behind the stage because of his hat.
"He chased me behind the stage.
He said, 'Don't go to the stage with this hat.'
They bombed me!
According to Washington Eggmann, he told me that he said I was in a low position."
Vest adds: "Do you want to see the low place?" He added, "He'll keep his Superman hat, because this means that you can't tell me what to do to me, do you want to improve the world?"
Test your love. "
The White magazine reported that because of its comments, the Chechens at least expressed their disapproval twice and the SNL's workers were worried: "Poora studio was totally quiet."
The West was led to Glaucoma Arina Gryde, who had been killed a few days ago.
The West dressed like a Pierre bottle, and put a lot of passengers in the darkness 'I love him'
We had the support of the President of TPUSA's head of the TPUSA Turner who tweeted: "Peace to one of the most encouraging spirits: Thanks for fighting Herham."
But the host of the truck show tweeted that West was just expressing his personality and that this is obviously amazing.
"We have chosen to pay a man's wage or buy a music or a dress or a "fan" that I think he's the one I think he's a member of my community.
He's free.
The same way we're free," he added.

Traditionally, in some parts of China, HIV infected through blood transfusions.
However, in a conference in the United States, Chinese doctors reported that in this way the number of infected HIV sufferers has grown almost zero.
Over the years, however, the number of HIV and AIDS cases in China has reached 10,000.
Moving through sexual relations is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In China, homosexuality was considered unacceptable in 1997, but it is said that the difference is still normal.
Because of the country’s official position, Students have estimated that 70-90 percent of men who have sexual relations with men are finally married to women.
Most of these infections are due to illicit sexual protection in such relationships.
To deal with this problem, the Chinese government has promised access to the HIV drug since 2003.

Hal reports what the government reports, such as Gatwendath and Red State, have reported that the IP address of the officers is connected with the office of the office of IP addressers Waters and also continued to provide information on the activity.
Waterers also said that it was entirely wrong and a lie.
My colleagues whose identity, identity, personal information and security have been threatened by these tricks and false accusations in no way responsible for carrying them out.
This is completely wrong and false.
The voice of Waters was immediately criticized online, including the former private security secretary of the White House.
Fisher wrote that it's very angry.
It shows that she doesn't have the spirit of being a member of Congress.
When they are accused of something, they don't have to be angry.
They don't have to work hard.
They should not be questioned about what they ought to do.
They have to be gentle and honorable."
It seemed that the comparison of the response to Palestine Warrs' response was similar to the criticism of the Democratic People's reactions on the judge Cheono's case was due to an extremely violent view during the hearing of a meeting in Kenya.

They said, "We're sure that responsible people are being brought to public view, and they're charged with all their duties, which is destroyed and dangerous to anyone else else's life."
Johany Engish Strikes Aggin's criticism test - the world of uninterruptive spys.
It is now traditional that any British view of the importance of Braggs in the new film is seen in the new film, but this does not come right on the recent development of the anti-racial activism activism of John Engish, starting with John Engish in 2003, and re-infecting John Englen in 2013 with public view.
Is the creation of private objects on this article a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the blind eyes out and the face of the buffalo had a second license to re-entreatment of things-- and that the sign of his sign is more than anything that has been created for the non-English mother-in-laws.
He's certainly a crazy secret agent who keeps a little bit of the features of his class within his class, the beauty of Mr. Ben Ben and London's conference at the 2012 Olympics alone.
His role is in fact based on Professor Attenson's tour and international person who was ever coming into the TV of the Barclay Card and left behind.
There's one or two good moments in this freshest jet.
I found it nice to walk toward a chopper in the middle of the Juni English corner with Millbos and his helmets.
Actival activists are on the scene, but they don't know how to create it, especially the "superious" movie brands, such as 007 and Mrs. Ms. Ms. Ms. Ms.
Funny feels that it's for little kids rather than adults, and for me, that's not so smart and modern as the silent hackers of Antons in Ben's personality.
Now the lasting environment is that British is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has been recruited on the most secret web of the spies and is showing the identity of all British agents in the field, now he has become a painful head for the agent on DVD.
It's the last thing for a Prime Minister who is a very weak person of beauty and courage, who is already a victim of total political abuse, who shares the role of this anti-technology Messa Mehsa Mei is best known but not much.
Their intelligence monitors inform us that every active spy is in danger, bringing them to a retired person.
And this means that the problem is to present itself to Juni English, who is now working as a schoolmaster in a field, but in some cases it's difficult to stop being an spy.
Juni is brought to the White Hall for a domestic exchange and is reunited with his former long-term partner Bobh, whose role is being financed.
Bo is now a married man, all my commander, a july hacky hacker whose role is short enough.
So the queen comes back to make things look like Batman and Robin's way of doing things in the Greater Square service, which is facing the Hussinko's Husseinko month when Ofilii was faced with Ofia Bolto.
The Mishnah, the prime minister of India, has been a dangerous magic spell that claims that he can solve the problems of the British computer: Manos Jason Waltat, whose role is Jacqueli.
Jenny and Bobo start their story with their colorful colors; in the afternoon they set up a French restaurant; they blow themselves into Wattt's parlor; and they create themselves to create a paradigm in Watalé; and when the new English Tefloll is trying to get the oil from the inside.
All parties have certainly been saved for this final event, but as interesting and global game is, the whole film looks like you're watching the TV of children.
There's enough middle-class content.
And as with other films of Jenny English, I always wonder if British film industry cannot play any role in any of its ability to act with justice?
The Liberia Party has been making a plan for British citizens to work four days a week, but take the wages for five days.
Jeremy Corren's lab party is considering an international project under which British citizens will work for four days a week, but the price is five days.
The party wants the company's colleagues to move the survivors through an extra day's development.

The sources said that this idea would be ‘right ’ for the intellectual agents and projects that want to be 'right' in the country for activists.
For four days travel, the UN Congress has confirmed that the change of economy can be enjoyed by activists.
A senior source of Leber Party told The Sandy Times: Prosecution on Policy is expected to be announced before the year ends.
It won't be night nights, but the four-me car week is an inspiration to re-communicate workers, but it's a good thing for the party's production industry.
The Leber Party is not the first party to have a wish, but the Green Party promised four weeks' weekend car in a general election campaign in 2017.
However, the Liberia party is not proofing this idea as a whole.
A translation of Leber Party states: The four am is not a car policy of the car party and it is not based on the party.
The reformer John MacDondel used his idea of bringing Lieber conferences into the atmosphere last week.
Mr. MacDonal said they are determined to return to power from the 'Dillary Directors' and the 'Noves of Light.'
The chairman of the debate also means that water companies cannot return their entire share in water companies because the Liberia government can't get 'cuts' because of the misperception that has been invented by the Liberia government.
He also confirmed that 10 percent of the workers in the company's board and 10 percent of the private sectors are planning to set up a branch fund, which will result in a year-old increase.
Landsy Grimm, John Candy tells "60 minutes" whether the investigation against FBI will change his mind.
FI's research on jobs against George Bret Kaoneo has been delayed at least a week in the Supreme Court and the question is that the study of bureaucracy is forced to support itself.
In an interview that was broadcast on Sunday, Scott Pelle, a writer named "60 minutes", asked the Republic Secretary John Kennedy and Linda Grimmer, asking if FB would find something that would make them change their mind.
Canadian South Carolina saw more seeds than they were with her.
Candy said, "I mean, of course."
I'm talking about going to the hearing.
After the charges came, I called Kevino and said, "What are you doing?"
They were both decisive and decisive.
However, in Granham's intention, I didn't see a rush.
He said that he had his opinion about Bret Kawon and should be accused of dynamite to change it.
I don't know what happened with Dr. Ford, but I do know that Brett's already updated it, he was pointing to the Christian Blackford.
No one can confirm the names they call.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any big change.

But how much has Global Cestin been successful in fulfilling his status while only 12 years left?
Is it a real way to convince people to apply the free conference to take action, or is there another form of 'Culkalism' that people think they're doing great things on an online mission or sending a hat?

The group also said that after more than 5,000 tools to improve the food for mothers and children from Britain, the government announced to provide a project, Power of New York, under which there are 5 million women and children who need food.
One question on your website is, "What makes you think we can end the harsh poverty?"
Global Security said: It's a long and difficult journey-- sometimes we fall and fail.
But, like the protests against citizen rights and ethnic intolerance, we are successful, because together we are stronger than we are.
In New York, some of those displaying their arts include Janet Jackson, Weatherend, Great Mennds, Cardy B and General Mona.

Bernard Wayne: The ceremony in honor of the priest who won the war in Victoria Christmas in the Great East
During the war during the Great War, the only winner of the Church of England was held in his hometown for 100 years in memory of the supreme church of England.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Wayne received this prize on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Belgium and Likhart.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a printing operation and never realized that he had gained the highest honor of the British Army.
On the weekend of the week of the Nathropon Shore, his two grandsons attacked the memorial stone during a parade.
One of his grandson Michael Wayne said that it is ‘dogically symbolic” that the stone has been visible at all 100 years old.
According to London Gasset, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Wayne took his belt across a "very deep metal and intense fires."
Later he moved fast toward the firing line and ran a field ball alone and led ahead with the three-dimensional "great headlines" ahead of his line.
Lieutenant Colonel Wayne was killed on October 4 October 1918 just a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Wayne said that his grandfather's agents are such things that he could never complete but a humble national service.
They and their brother, Dr. James Wayne, climbed flowers in the leadership of the British War Olympic Youth Day.
Michael Wayne said that they feel honored to participate in the press and "a real hero's smile is being reflected by a lot of people."

Coke said I'm thinking when we think about the train, I think we can figure out the solution.
But there's six o'clock on Sunday morning, and we're not able to celebrate it on Sunday, according to our time.
But we're working on it.
Make sure a lot of test messages were received and they were not all friends when this change took place.
We're trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, but it was a government problem.
I promise you that there will be no future.
We'll focus on five competitions instead of six -- just as we do the regulars -- we tried to give the kids more fun and we couldn't do it.
This is a desperate situation.

Haut of Farm Michaelson was added to the week’s record
American Phil McLains will set up a record on Sunday when they play their 47th Reddy Cup match, but they have to restore their format to avoid setting an unhappy zero.
Macmillan, who is playing 12 times a record every six months after every six months, is one of the 12 times recorded by Captain Jimfork, added to the day of the FOOLs and Forr Shams.
Instead of becoming the focus of people's eyes, which is often for America, Michaels, the winner of the five big championships won, divided his day into a teacher leader and to take his weaknesses off.
She can never throw the right ball into her career's chair, so 48-year-old sports isn't appropriate for the school of Golf Nationals, where long heads of wrong shots are severe.
And even though the course is not so difficult as it is, on Sunday, it will be with the British Oppenpe Guanarei, who lives with block Tommy Fittwood this week.
If US that's on the loss of four points at the start of 12 zero magazines, the press will be really important.
Fork expressed his confidence in his player.
He said: "This day I saw (the prison) which I had thrown down, one upon the other's feet, and I got ready for it this day."
He trusts himself.
He's got popularity and in the past and this week he has given much to these teams.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought more than that, but what happened and maybe we thought was the same.
Like every other player, he wants to be in the field.
He'll play Sunday and play the best Faldo's record to play the game.
It may end with the record of the purchase of her directorship, but she has no connection with the tops of her own record.
Maleson has been successful 18 times, failed and over 20 times as many as seven times, but Fows said that his presence has made the team a lot of fun.
He explained that he's fun, Tasia, tricky, likes to mess with people and the lives of the team's room.
I think young players enjoy it and have been enjoying it for a week.
It's got a lot to play.
European Captain Thomas Baron knows that the big lead can be finished soon.
European Captain Thomas Barons knows from his experience that a lot of leading lead can easily be transformed into trouble in the final day contests.
The Danish player started his career in Waldensia in 1997, where a team of Americans was higher than five points on the US, but when they reached the end line, they succeeded with 14 -13 C.E.
Byron said you're reminding yourself that we had a big lead in the Waldensia, we have big lead in Brooklyn, where we're defeated and we live in Vietnam, but with little more killings.
So history has been told that everyone in the team has not finished.
Today with complete preparation goes into the field.
Go there and do everything properly.
Things don't end until you get the point on the board.
We're a hero, and it's that it's going to win this trophy and all our attention is over it.
I always said that I'm going to focus on 12 side players of my side, but we're pretty sure that we're on the best race on the world.
Happy with the performance of his athletes on a tough black course, Baron added: I've never been quick in it.
Tomorrow we'll have a different call.
Tomorrow individual activities will be visible, and there's a different thing to do.
When circumstances are about to be in the field with a partner, but when you're alone there, your full potential is tested as a pilot.
It's the message that you have to fully prepare the players and take advantage of their ability.
Now you leave your partner behind and you have to go and show your full potential.
The opposite number is expected to display better performances than shoes of its players, the Mayor Jordanship, and the Jettts who raised three of the four of them.
After being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, Europe's team was defeated when Europe's team received "Medicine".
When he was asked how the captain became captain in 1999 took his players to the last day, I replied, "I remember every word of it."
Tomorrow we'll be 12 important matches, but you'll want to reach this fast start like you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Macedonia.
When she moves on one side, she puts too much pressure on the middle bees.
We're going to set up our line, and we're going to do this kind of game tomorrow we're going to show some magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the task of leading a response to the attack, and how it dealt with Rori McKallie in Tap Macle and Paul, June Day, June Day, Tommy Field, and Inner Post and Intelports.
Baron said about his puzzle's issues that I put my players in this order because I think it's covering the whole game.
The new German warship was reunited once again
The new German Navy was to replace the shipships in 2014, but this is not at least possible for the next year, according to local media, its causes are worthless, and Hosabra is missing.
The Die Zeit newspaper told of a military translation that the first flight to the New Budden-Virtburg class was made up of the "Rainland Falls" committee of the new London-Virtburg class. Now it was completed to the beginning of the 2019 strike.
The ship would have to be in the ocean in 2014, but then the problem of Delior put down the Olympic planned project to ruin the project.
Four ships of the Baden-Virtburg class, whose orders were given in 2007, will replace the former Berlin class.
It is considered to be a powerful investor on these ships, a flightship of different kinds and ship suspects, including radio radar, airports, and mobile devices, such as radio broadcasts, airports, and mobile devices.
Other important features include longer lengths of Mintenos - what can modernest Frontier Fitz have been able to set away from his native port for two years?
Dy Zeit, however, indicates that these modern battleships will continue to make them brief until they enter the service before they are admitted to the service.
Less luck came to F125 Reds last year when Germany's Navy refused to reduce the ship and sent him back to Balham & Voice Airport in Hamburg.
It's the first time that the ocean has returned a ship after Delore.
There were little information about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted the "software and hardware" which would make the warship useless if it was set on a safety mission.
The chairs of the software were particularly important because the ships of Baden-Virtburg class were only about 120 miles [200 km]-- which is nearly half of the population force on the old Borman class.
It also came to the scene that the ship's weight was too high, which limits its performance and enables it to add app gradients to the future for the ocean.
It is estimated that 7000 tons of tons weighs from Germany to World War II is twice the weight of the same class ships.
In addition to illegal hardware, the whole project's project's project's project's project's project's project's project has also been a problem.
It's said that his log has reached the price of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars).
The recent issues of the new Fergitus are increasing in the light of the German ocean power.
At the beginning of this year, President Hans Peter Balts, head of the German Parliament's defense community, admitted that the lack of the ability of ships to reach the Pacific Ocean.
The contractor said the problem has been serious with time, because the plane has been cleared, but they have not been given a new ship.
He lamented that no Fergut at the Bond-Virtburg class was able to join the Atlantic Ocean.
Research on the Hidden Life of National Test
The purpose of the new research done in a wake of the Scottish Highlands is to find out how insects use natural means to search for food.
The results are expected to bring new light on the behavior of these rare creatures and guide for future security activities.

The NHS program and volunteer personnel will take action in the mobile service.
All recording voices will be examined by the French and what kinds of types are going to be doing in all kinds of videocassettes.
The map and report will then be created to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
The director of natural protection for NTS hoped that the results would show that the most important sectors of the tigers are for insects and how they are used for all kinds of forms.
This information will help build grass for insects and related species and determine the benefits of maintaining forests.
In the past century, there has been a dramatic decline in the population of Champagads throughout Scotland and Britain.
Their population is threatened by construction and development work that affects their hunger and gambling.

Mr. David Thompson, the manager of State said it's a better place for them.
He said we have a wonderful place here in Threvée.

Mei Yuga claimed that after the tragedy, Rolando fell in front of his knees and told him that he was a "99%" but he was overcome by "one percent of evil".
The document claims that Rolando has confirmed that he had sexual relations, but that was a willingness to do so.
Ma Yuriga also claimed that he went to the police and took pictures of his injuries in the hospital, but later he agreed to install outside the court because he was afraid of "terrorism".
21-year-old Maurga says she wants to end this depression because she's constantly in Tehran because of the tragedy.
During the attack, Raul Medhakrishter was about to leave the United States and moved into Italian club with 100 million Euro agreements in the summer.

If March 29th comes out of the DU without Britain, the border can be blocked by a delay or delay in providing parties.
The company says it's impossible for Twitter to keep more money than a day's price in its terror show. So the product will have to be closed.
Mr. Clarke said that the Chicores project for the future relationships with the Thrace-EU has been prepared to avoid these tests on the border."
We have to make a covenant with BBC radio 4 program that tells us that we want a better deal of dealt with the current situation but take advantage of this opportunity.
Not only Twitter but other psychologists testify that we will be able to continue our highly successful Japanese Chinese entirely.

But we'll take care of it and I always like to keep the press."
Some reporters would reject this claim: Sanders didn't have press brakes in the White House since September 10th.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sendor said, "If Mr. Brownings wasn't jealous of the lack of news reporters, I wouldn't deny that they understood them."
Then they decided that the communication between the Trump and the press would be more direct.
Without a reference, he said, "The nurse has more questions than his former president: we've seen the number of them."
Sandra said, "Bridges will still be, but if press has the opportunity to ask direct questions from the president of the United States, it's definitely better to talk to me.

The heat wave of summer has increased the sale of British lower levels but increased pressure on tourists.
Statistics indicate that 2.7 percent of the prices and repeated groups were seen in July - but in restaurants it was sold by 4.8 percent.
The data collected by the CGA Ministry, Peter Marton, said: "In the World Cup, more than usual sun and England expected, it meant that I was seen by June 2.8% of the past month as the price of sale increased by 2.8%, that the price of retailers was less than that.
In June, 1.8 percent of the Russian business in the United States got worse in July.
If the sale of tourists is compared to the sale, as long as the sale of resurgents has failed, they have been successful.
The birds on the food were also affected in the sun, but not as much as the restaurant operators were affected.
It sounds like people want to drink out of the drink.
The same-adjusted plastics and bar consumption increased to 6.6 percent this month, while food prices were reduced to three percent.
Reliance and hospitality researcher Reneel Sels manager Paul Newton said: "These results continue with the attitude we have seen from the end of April.
As far as the outside market is concerned, the effect of weather and important social or sports is the most important factor.
Despite the lack of 4.8 percent of the year's sale, it is not surprising that the refugee groups are now under stress and that they are especially affected by the pressures of the ongoing cost.
During the long summer season for food operators there was no worse than that and time will tell whether the most reliable amount of heat is needed to provide adequate rest.
In recent years, however, there have been 2.7 percent of police and politicians on July 2.7 percent, who reflect a lack of attitudes toward brands.

The show of Brest Pimp in which Mothers were compared to bears has been distributed online.
The president of a British department distributed online arts, compared to a cow with milking mothers.
User Technological Company (Elvie) has published a video broadcast that shows the freedom of the new platforms.
Four real mothers are dancing in a song, which includes the following words: "Yes, I'm pregnant, but you don't see anything."
The gathering continues: "Get him out, I'll draw him out, get him out, get him out, get him out, get him out, get him out of there, I'll milk the women's milk."
However, the newspaper that was published on Facebook page, she has given online updates.

It doesn't matter whether it's the credit for the dinner industry or it's not about setting opinions on it.
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they were dancing in their Brasília.

"I thought we could really do something like that he's saying-- the investigation that we can create a couple of differences about it, and further increase their fear of being "corrupt".

The goal of North Korea is less than expected
A South Korean law says there is a low number of guests going to South Korea after seven years of independence.
Park Bang Swang quoted the data for South Korea's uniform performance in South Korea last year, saying that the number was 1,127 -- which was 2,7606 in 2011.

Pong didn't comment on any public comment.
A large number of visitors from North Korea have been introduced to South Korea.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have been illegal since the end of the war in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which is the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to split the most secure zone between both sides of the country than the DMZ.
China thinks illegal migrants are more illegal than Muslims and often sends them back by force.
Relationships between North and South Korea - who are still in the war - has improved in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pong Yang to protest, who had been subjected to mobilization in the Huof New York Police.
The meeting took place in June with the US President Trump and Cogjing, after their historic visit to Singapore, when he agreed to clean the island's display on a wide range of terms to clean up Korea from New York.

Polycise did this comment on the week of Austin, Texas, during an interview at Texas Tribun Festival.
Plusy responded to the statement of Kawana in front of the Secretary of State on Thursday evening, saying, "I can't do anything, but I think if a woman performs such a thing, she'll say, "I can't do it."
Kwana sincerely denied the charges that she attacked Dr. Christine Blassi Ford, when they were both young.
At the beginning of her statement, Kwana was very emotional, and sometimes she was talking about the years of her family and high school years.
He criticized the open words of the committee's Department's Department's Democrats representative, who was calling the "Mr.H.K.K.M. M.M. #S.M. #C.R.R.M. #S.R.R. #C.R.R.R.M.S.C. #C.R.R.R.R.R.R.M.S.R.M.C.C.R.R.R.R.R.R.M. #U.R.S.R.R.R.R.R.M.R.R.M.M.M.R.R. #U.R.S.R.R.R.R.R.R.M.M.M.R.M.R.M.R.M.R.M.R.C.R.R.R.M.R.R.M.R.R.R.M.R.M.M.R.M.R.R.R.M.R.M.M.M.R.R.M. #
He said they've confirmed that Kwana's testimony has proved that they can't do the horrors in the Supreme Court because it has proved that they are connected to the Diocletes.
He said, "I think he's ruined himself in a way of blaming such stories and criticism of the demographics."
When asked to be told, "If Kesia is true, and the majority of the delegates get to the source, will they try to find the source?"
He said, "I'll say that -- if they don't speak the truth from Congress or FI, they're not just in the Supreme Court but in this court that they're still in."
Kwana again D.C. circuit Cort in April.
Plosys adds that they are concerned about the possible decision against the government's possible decision against the federate car sector of Kenya (Afphodical Credit Act) or the opinion of the video (Roe v. Waede) because it is considered to be an official authority.
In his confirmation hearing, Kwavanna stopped asking questions about whether he would change some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
He said, "It's not the time to go to court and expect us to say, "It's not amazing."
And women have to keep him under control.
The fact is that there are months of anger and anger for months and years, and she can't escape without it.
Lady Stanim told me 45 years later, "When we are angry, we cry"
"I don't think it's normal, do you think?"
He continued his speech, "A woman helped me a lot of help that was where the Ecicco treaty was at, and she told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she got a ability which means that when they were angry, she started to cry, she would say, "You can talk to me."
But I'm angry."

"They don't know you're angry.
They think you are upset and happy, and they are overcome.
