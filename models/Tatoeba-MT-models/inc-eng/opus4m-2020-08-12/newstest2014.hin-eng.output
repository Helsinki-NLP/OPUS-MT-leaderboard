Black box in your car?
While the U.S. road scheme is struggling to improve the high-air systems, many people are watching its solution in small black box, which hits your car's dashboard.
This device, which tracks every mile that is driven by the motor- driver and communicates to authorities, has now become a controversial attempt to reverse the old U.S. major roads to destroy the U.S. main roads.
Publicly, such as high planning, has become a subject of profound debate and life-related issues.
The miles you have driveed, and probably the drive is probably a description of the location - and then this information can be used - support the government for allowing the use of this black box to be used by the Librierative environment groups.
Tea party is stupid.
American citizen freedom organization is also concerned with taking different issues of privacy.
While Congress don't agree whether it's going to happen or not, many of the kingdoms are not waiting.
They're looking for how they can go to a system in the next decade to pay for each mile set on the road.
Thousands of motor- drivers have already taken the black box for test drive, in which some of the Gps is monitoring.
It's actually an essential object for our country.
"It's not about whether it's our choice or not" says Hasan Iraq, who is working director of the Southern California government, who is planning to start tracking every mile set by motorists in California by the year 2015.
We're about to change our way of paying.
It's a prodigious to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's High Trust Foundation is nearly Delhi, which is due to the payment of taxes made by American citizens.
American people don't buy gas anymore.
The car runs more than a gallon gas now.
There has been no increase in Federal Tax last 20 years, which is per 18.4 per cent.
Because of the high price of gas, politicians also try to increase a money in taxis.
Transportists at Minnesota University say, "It's impossible."
His kingdom has recently set up a tracking device in 500 cars to test the per-mail payment system.
They say, "In the past it will work as the most logical option."
Vox calls it Miles-based user Tulu.
It is not surprising that this idea seems to be good for citizens, since it can be transformed into trades in order to run a car as a car, which can help to reduce and reduce Grinhaus gas.
California plans for this system while they are building regulations to meet the goals set by the state's Royal Warming laws.
But the head of home transport committee, Rep. Bill Shuster (A.P.A.) also believes that Black Box is the longest-term option.
Free vendors in Regen Foundation are also on behalf of each mile payment by the driver.
Adrian Moore, president of the Policy, said, "It's not what he does that is going into the dark."
People are paying more clearly for what they're getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former American transportees who had been able to move from Congress in their report in 2011.
U.S. Sinnet accepted a test project of 90-million dollars last year, including 10,000 cars.
But working on rural rules and traditions, representing people who have to go to work every day or go to the city, the leader of the parliament concluded the proposal there.
Yet many of the kingdoms and cities are moving in this direction.
It is the most favorite Aragon, who has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest use.
These drivers will soon pay back Mallez Tucul instead of the government.
Nevada has already completed the initial experiment.
New York City is moving in this direction too.
Illinois is being tested with trucks on limited basis.
And the I-95 compound, including 17 Kingdom transport departments with East Sebod (including Myanmar, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is studying how they can operate this change.
This idea was not supported by all places.
In Nevada, where the device was soon placed on 50 volunteer drivers, drivers were very tired to think that the government could monitor their every move.
"The problem was the main concern about Brother and other things."
It's not something people wanted.
In addition to continuing the test, the A.C.L.U. from Nevada warned on his website: “It would be easier to convert this device into the full tracking device.”
There is no need to develop large, unprejudiced educational frames, which must be expanded to record every person’s daily coming.
Newada is one of the many states she's trying to achieve her potential for advanced technology, with help to find a description of how many miles the car is going every day, but not where she is going.
Khan said, "If you can do this, people can feel more easily."
The search for this prodogic brought some state agents to the small California startup.
It wasn't in the business to help the players who were basically ruling.
This was trying to get into the market with AutoBama, which the drivers had to pay on their miles.
But the device that is testing this is doing well, because it does not use GpS and provides too much information, which is uploaded by the modem at the specified time interval.
He said: If you desist not, surely I will cast it forth to your people, those who are of the stock, that they may choose to do (it).
In these initial events of the Kingdom, there have been some serious mistakes.
There are also low costs and less interventions to do this.
In Oregon, the schemer is using different-wayd options.
They can choose the device of Gps with or without Gps.
Or no device can be selected again, but choose to determine whether the average mile that will be set by the state's residents.
Other places hope that anxiety citizens may be deprived by providing more facilities than less than the device.
In New York City, Transport officials are trying to develop a taxiing device, which would also have the advantage of paying the parking meter tribute, "paying the insurance according to your drive," and other drivers will create a collection of real time data from other drivers that can be used to avoid traffic traffic.
The city plans document notes that "Mor-master will be attracted to participation because of the benefits it receives from it."
However, some travel plans may surprise that the whole discussion on payment according to miles is a big distraction.
In San Francisco, Metropolitan Transportation Aug says that Congress can easily deal with the problem of increasing gas taxis.
Additional time or anniversary can be placed on the hardware or other cars drivers, who don't use too much gas to pay their proper share.
The Ayog's statement and the director of public affairs said, "When Espian can work, what is necessary for him?"

Fornicator Airlines cari-on-Beggses will be updated.
Fornicator Airlines is planning to charge $100 to store stuff for passengers on your plane.
In Fornicator Airlines, a car-on-Beag is planning to start $2 for $2 for coffee or leave, though, it's announced that passengers can keep the entire bar.
The new car-on-on is for the bag in overhead bin, so, smaller bags under the seat will be released again.
Fornicator said that if 25 charge is paid in Athens, $100 wait if the passengers are waiting for payment until they're on the gate.
Frontier Prime Minister Kate O'Malley said that he had to take care of charge of the charge in the issue of $100.
"We don't want to charge," he said.
Airlines started charge for the first and second test bag in 2008.
Those who are trying to survive from the looters who are trying to survive all they can do in the car-on bag, which means there's often less space in this database.
There's a way to reduce your friends on the light board.
O'Malley said it's not really about buying new charge money.
This has made it difficult for most of the most faithful customers to find the location of the Overhead Bin.
The airports who buy tickets to their website don't have to give it.
This means that the next person in the line may have a hundred dollars for the same bag, while a travelingr on the line can receive a bag, a bag.
O'Malley said that the website and check operations of the Forintor are being changed to those processes before getting the gate.
Forintor's new car - on-on-five, will not start until summer although a date has not been specified.
Travelers often express uncertainty about Begazzul and other locomotives, but plane services like them.
They reason that the bag needs money to handle the bag, and those who want the service should pay for it.
The fees on Wall Street have been seen as a sign that many Airlines are paying enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years.
Most have not even been to Carrie - On the Back See.
Spatit Airlines Inc. started the first three years ago, and the partner Dwarfer Allent Air.
The Vizz Err of the other Airlines hacker, who said, and who tracks the Ad-on-on fiss.
He was estimated in December 2011 in Sparit's Carri - on one $50 million who brought $50 million in a year.
A former officer of Soreensen, Midwest Airlines recently surprised the passengers to meet on the gate on the gate with a surprise.
"The boarding process that I saw was easy in my Airline career," he said.
I was hoping to taste teeth and see out of a fight gate.
"The human was full and he said it's a stick-breaker."
Frantier's also following $2 dollars for coffee, tea, tea, or juice.
Fornicator is honest that those who leave the passenger, or take the jurors can keep the entire divorce, and this free coffee will only be given for once.
It'll still take away the water.
In 2008, the US Airways tried to charge for drinking things, but seven months after the complaint of passengers, they left behind and followed after any other major Airlines.
Frontier's passengers don't buy directly from the airline, they're trying to monitor this move on the center of Fortier's website.
Airlines pay online traffic vendors for $10 from $25 for each sold ticket.
That's why all Airlines are encouraged to buy friends directly from those online traffic agency rather than go through an online traffic agency.
Fornicator, though, has gone ahead in this field.
In September several of the flights started giving half to customers who bought an online traffic agency from these guys.
On Wednesday, it reduced the trip mile by 25 percent.
So, an online traffic agency bought from the agency would release a 1,000 miles away from Frantier trip 250 miles away.
It also allows them to choose their seat in front of the first time when they buy it directly from the Fronter website.
Fortier's Denver is a faithful base of customers in his home city, but it's getting less commercial and losing money.
Nine percent of the collapses and its flight capacity in the kingdom have been less than 13 percent less than the first three times, according to the ongoing financial consequences by the Corporate Parental Airlines Holders Inc.
Trying to determine the sale of the Frontier as part of the Republic Airlines.

This problem will be solved this evening.

At evening the online server tracker found that the website of the NSA was closed for at least six hours, and the site is not yet accessible for some users.
The NSA Prime Minister told the ABC.News that the agency's internal, sensitive network was "not even compatible" with the inner, sensitive network.
The chief said, "No classified information is in danger."
At least one Hectorist group has claimed online that they are responsible to ban the website of the NSA by the DD.S. attack.
The DD.O.S. attack is designed so far as to send traffic to the website so far, unless the site is above-loaded.
This is expected to occur, and the purpose of attacks is not to distinguish the internal network of internal networks in the system.

Mental-based Bombardier also did not offer an update on any flight test data for his brand new Seies planes planes, or the plane's plane's next September.
About one month before the first flight of the test plane, it's just been blown three times, question whether the test phase is on the track.
The result was reduced to a low degree and sent to more than 8 percent of the shared Toton Stock Exchange.
A analyser with the National Bank Fairenshiel, a viewer who had reduced his rating to the "Mother" scored on Thursday to the next one or two inches.
"The manager was expecting too much of the plane, we are obviously disappointed with the Merzin exhibition in transport, "Dorson said in a client note."
We'll get a new order for Bombarder Seies as progress of the flight program.
However, if no new orders are announced in months to come, doubt the market will be satisfied.
Bombarder expects plane families now to cut it off at least at the end of Boeing and Airbes' market.

The main worker Pyrey Bodoin believed that Bombarder would complete his 300 Form Order target from time to time to bring the first jet commercial use.
The authorities assured the media that the program was acting in harmony with the list.
"The first plane was on the ground for a long time compared to a long time," he said in a conference call, adding it to the ground testing and software updates.
Every maker makes a schedule in a different way.
We had decided to fly a first and an update period and said what we did.
That flight program will be all through.
The rest of the five test planes, with the rest of the following weeks, expect to be loaded in the coming weeks, said the company.
Nevertheless, analysts believe that customers can start a cesarees plane after their first flight in 12 months.
Bombardard said that the service index (EIS) was evaluated in the entry and will provide an update in the next few months.
"It's slow inspection of this slow test - though with the internal index of Boombarr - but our thought is confirmed in the square will be buried in Q1/15," said Dossen.

Mr. Big gives secret information about the police investigation of the Koqueen lawyer Kacara.
The 42 - year - old Dieta Deta was informed by Naxor Scarboro
The chairman felt that his secret drug habit might be exposed to people
He was sentenced to three years in prison
To the top of the defense party, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid that people would find out about his secret drug addiction, three years ago.
After 42-year-old Dieta made a deal with his cokeline, the notorious criminal scarboro provided sensitive information about his Nazi drug sclerosis tests.
This policy, which was named "Bash", and which was praised by the criminals as "tap Brif," was arrested in the year 2011 by the police officer in Scarborough, who was represented by the former Natrix Trix.
Authorities saw 32-year-old Scarboro in Blackburn, Lakeshire, with three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house, while he was outside with his colleagues.
The hair of Deta's hair, his battua, and his credit card found that cocacans of the late A class were “unsided user”.
During the eight months between January 2011 and August 2011, he tried to get an illegal information about the arrest of two people from Scarboro and his colleagues.
All four cases were being conducted by police as part of a major investigation of Lycashire, Kumber, Masseedi, Burkesshire, and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other people who were sent to prison during the number of prints by the police during the cost of 1.5 million pounds, and more than 20,000 dollars were sent to prison.
42-year-old Dieta had been reporting to the criminals because he was afraid that people would not know about his cocan blade.
In Blackbeard, the status of the State for Forbes Salissites went up to three weeks to ban the execution of justice after the trial was found in two cases today after the trial was found.
He's accepted to keep cocaine in the previous hearing.
The wrong time of the lawyer began when the police found out that he was regularly on the phone with the data since February 2011.
Two spies pursued the disease and saw him coming to the house of Data and wearing over 60 percent clean drinks under the lawyer's bin.
After being treated with narcotic drugs, Scarboro was regularly connected to the phone with the rest of the phone, who was out for dinner in Blackburn Rivers football stadium, Ewood Park.
When the lawyer arrived home, he found out that there was a Nazi drug there and that there was nine times in the middle.
The court was heard that he had found a “symbolic user” when he was found on data hair, butter, and credit cards.
Dita was later arrested, but she refused to use cocaine and said that she was talking to the confirmed dealer because she was his client and said that their discussion was the subject of "social privilege".
During his arrest, Detita tried to remove a lot of credit cards, but they were arrested, and his hair was modeled.
In the police interview he said he was running his office with his job-sharing office, and called on his client's home for procedures.
After the arrest of the chief men, what did the court know about them, was said to call the chief of the DATTa narcotic drug department, where some people had previously presented the case before.
From the organizer's party, Eni White said: "You should know best not to break the law."
Mr. Dieta is accused of misusing your position as a criminal official, too much to connect with your special client.
We're not talking about ordinary mental drug dealers, but not about a dealer who's providing his lawyer with drugs.
Some of their conversations must have been legal without doubt because she was lawyer.
But he went beyond his limits to the lawyer-client relationship.
He insisted on the police investigation so that they would be able to continue their violent activities.
Mr. Dietta was not honoring his profession, but humiliated.
He made a lot of connections to a certain client, especially from Scarboro, and he allowed his freedom to deal with his own freedom.
Dita refused to do anything wrong and claimed: "If I were not a corrupt lawyer, and if I would not be a corrupt lawyer, I would not wait for Mr. Scarborough to provide information, but I would do it immediately."
But after hearing hearing, the superintendent of Lakesher Police said: "Mr.D. Dieta at the time when she started taking drugs with organized criminals, he changed himself into a criminal policy."
Because of his cocaine, he made a huge compromise and became very weak to the purposes of the leading members of organized crime groups, who used him to find important information related to the police investigation.
Members should have the highest standard of honesty and trust in men.
Mr. Daytta has been deceived by this belief and has tried to survive in his career.
The serious and organized crime unit of Lakshare tested Mr. Dieta, which has also been found guilty of three events to keep track of them and press them into the way of justice, which shows our loyalty to the courts.
This case should be a warning for criminals that no one is beyond the access of law.
We'll find you and present you to the court.
Scarboro was sentenced to 14 years in exile after being found guilty of harassing heroin, cocaine and bungling.
Thirty-five other members of the group were sent to Karasa for a total of 153 years for drug crimes.

Georgia’s parents, who died in the 'Unfortilable accident', believe that their son had been murdered.
A youth in Georgia whose dead body was found in her high school registrar, believes that their son was murdered, the family secretary told the master.
Waldo, the G.A. Candy Johnson was caught directly behind her high school James in the middle of high school.
The researchers of London’s County Sheriff concluded that Johnson had died in a 'antic accident', but the family of the 17-year-old boy refused it.
Benjamin Camp, who presented Keneth and Jacklin Johnson, said to Fox Newz Dot Kom: "They fully believe that their son has been killed."
They don't trust in death in the way they were told of Sheriff's death.
He said, "They believe it's the same as physical laws and common sense."
They feel that this is an excuse for the death of their son or for the safety of people.
He said, "They sent your son to school with a bookback, and he's back in a boat bag."
The U.S. Mr. Michael Basere told the Master that he was experimenting with a official investigation on the death of Johnson, seeing many important questions are accepted.
What was the cause of death?
Was his murder due to a crime?
He said these things at noon,
I will make known the truth. Let them bring us wherever we may be.
My purpose is to bring the truth to reality.
He said, "I think there's an environmental cause for an official investigation."
Murray told reporters that Johnson's death was resulting from the "supervic shock" death.
According to Muura, thus found a different reason for death in a second death test."
They said, “We will question you a number of questions, or we will be convinced.”
Murray also said that if he found enough evidence to correct a criminal in the case of Johnson's death or check on civil rights, he would tell F.B.I. to do it.
Delegates were not immediately available to comment from the office of London County Sheriff's office when contacting the Thursday.
On Wednesday, South Georgia’s judge ordered the authorities to continue all surveillance videos discussed by the investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope they'll get some signals from video tapes on how he died.
The CCD has issued a child's intelligence-reportment for colleges.
On Wednesday, Wednesday, the disease control and preventment centre continued to control the children’s food supply in school.
The U.S. government has for the first time issued such direction because the number of children who go to college is increasing from food allergies.
Now in U.S. one of every 20 children has food allergies.
C.D.C. found that 18 percent of children between 1997 and 2007 have increased in food allergies.
In this direction, schools have been notified how teachers and employees are informed of the child’s eating allergy, and how to handle it in the case of an allergic reaction.
The colleges are also recommended to keep the stick of Epiphany's office to meet potentially familiar gravity (apophraxis) - which is the auto-igen agent of the appen Brand, which is usually used in most cases.
The State Council has recently updated rules in order to keep the company's stocks in high school.
The report also includes a list of common symptoms that are transmitted by children who are affected by an allergic reaction.
The child might say, "My tongue sounds like my tongue's hair" or "My tongue sounds confused."
Parents of Intersex Kidds can choose 'sexual 's 'interceptives' of their children
The first country in Germany has become a country that has granted the third gender recognition for children born with unsurpassed genetically.
Newborn children will no longer be specified in traditional ways.
According to the new law, parents do not need to announce gender for such children, the law allows them to declare “unclean” or “international” on the child’s birth certificate.
The purpose of the new law is to reduce pressure on parents who can make decisions related to gender-techism for newborn children soon, and fight discrimination against the Internet.
According to B.B.C., an interviewer said years later, "No, I am a man, not a woman."
I'll be made by doctors, dressed in jewelry.
According to estimates, a quarter of every 2,000 children every year is like a child without a child, not a girl.
They are intersperses, part of about 60 cases that come to the underlying tests of sexual development, which is a common word that is used to be used for an unusually developed gender.
Maybe Wallace Simpson is on the Internet.
The gender identity is not still considered properly, but most experts in the United States believe that it is better to use the best information available for the gender when it cannot be sex-synthesis and to define the gender, if such a thing occurs, to monitor the first mental and physical development of the child.
Dr. Jack Drew, a psychologist in New York City, said that Germany's new law appears to be "good things."
Intersex generates moral degradation.
He said, "There are some people in life-related conditions that require surgery, but most of them don't."
You can specify only the gender without surgery, and then see how the identity becomes developed.
Science is not very precise to know how any gender will develop in a child.
No one can answer correctly why this is so.
It's a kind of puzzle that people are gay.
In the 2011 report on the European Commission, 2011, the Internet has been described as different from Transxuals or Transients people, because their status is not related to gender but is related to its genetic structure, which is not obviously a male or both.
These features can be displayed on a secondary sexual screen, such as the weight of cats, the distribution of hair, breast and length; pretensive sexual attraction; or the quality structure and hormones.
The report also provides a preview of the discrimination, violence, and discrimination crimes that have been dealt with by the International and Transcendent persons, as well as the discrimination, violence, and discrimination.
Now there are special camps for non-sexual boys.
Australia and Nepal have already been allowed to mark old persons on their official documents as men, women, or "terrorist".
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norwegian May-Wowby, after winning legal appeal for life, became the world's first "non-sexual" person.
According to the internal Ministry, there will also be a third specification for Inter-International people in the German passport, besides M or F.
According to the news report on France 24, the points related to gender in the neighboring country are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French rules from this Catholic country have signed on the application to return to the school's books "Ling Policy" for return from college books.
The U.S. website Catholic online has also opposed the law of Germany by saying, "As the world is going to be in such a state, there is a choice of gender to be chosen, but there are no actional action, but not following two other columns of equality."
The newborn baby's mother in Marland also told Baby John that she would like to be named after the children when they were born.
He said on the website "Institution is very stressful without limits, especially if you don't know what your child's gender is."
Children need stability and stability.
Historically, children born with both male and female gender were called Hermiphradits (wombing) in the name of the beautiful Greek god, which was bilingual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered gender as a stick that could be deleted and written.
But now many people are challengeing the morals of surgery, they realize that sexual-human activity is complex, and sometimes even medical doctors who don't know what their gender will feel about when children grow up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called "mornoomic crisis."
When these children were born, you didn't call psychologicalists, you called for surgery.
The current principle about treatment of unborn babies was presented by Dr. John Manny at University of the University of John Hepkins University, who viewed gender as an awesome.
He created the word "king identity" and argued that how social and environmental parents raise the child - and finally the child's genes and hormones determine that he would be recognized as a man or as a woman.
But in one case in 1966, their principles became controversial.
They urged their parents to complete their child's eggs and get out of the red-funded girl, whose gender-granger-capsis (surrection) had been hit during the accident.
She said: "Nay, but she did bring a good end, even though they did not appear to be successful."
At the age of 15, the child changed himself as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dreyer said that some doctors are still "following his image".
But in the year 1990, with the arrival of the Internet in the following years, those passing by from the gender-chicking process started to come in front of "not happy."
The same case was with Jim Bruce, 36-year-old writer of Montana, who was born with XV. man with property, but his genetic disorder was rare.
Doctors didn't clearly understand that her gender was small, or her passion was bigger, but they were sure she could never live as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's outer ring and anesthesia was removed from his outer ring and anesthesia, and he was like a newborn girl.
He was given female Hormon at the age of 12.
He told ABCNews.com, "I knew I'm not a girl."
I wasn't happy, but questioning was too difficult.
When he was 18 years old, he was going to have to be with him.
But feeling insecure and some confusion, he asked for medical archives.
This gave him the fear of the truth.
When I was born-- and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with D.S.D., who prevented his body from producing sufficient teststones, which could not be developed properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man, he stole teststone and removed his breast.
He's busted because of surgery.
Today, he teaches people to make their own opinion about the Internet people in the Interface Project.
However, the method of California-based group of equinoxes for En-Tarr-Mats worry that Germany's law "accomplishs and disgrace."
He says, "Many activists think that Germany's law will move parents to make immediate decisions and specify the child "unemployed".
We fear it will encourage intervention.
We think it's better to specify man or woman gender rather than wait.
But we don't know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Terma-Mattis said that his organization supports Australian law because "This allows the elderly to be recognized in the third gender."
He said, "The elderly should be able to make their own decision about sex."
Germany's law is related to specifying it when it was born.
It's not a battle to fight by newborns at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions related to their body.
But Stan radiology Dr. Erin Bartez, a daughter of Young Development developer, who helps hundreds of others in support, said that Germany's law would provide both parents and children "power."
Bartji's daughter Katti man was born with properties, but she was called D.S.D.
Because his intelligence was wrong in the garage, so female surveillance was developed in Katy.
His body has twins, but there's no abortion or dyslexia.
Now 29-year-old Katy is married, and child psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she's drunk, she expects to be mother through her attempt to take a bullet or to become a guest Sargosi.
He said, “This is the decree of my parents, that they may do no wrong, and may haply come quickly.”
It provides them with proper understanding and time before they write, 'human' or 'human'.'
This way, you stay well - raise your child, love the child.
You have a lovely kid and enjoy him.
We don't have to do any kind of surgery that can't be restored.
They said: "This brings up children in the process of making decisions, and it is the father of the child who sends them away because they do not believe in them."
Finally, the child will determine which sex he's more easily -- and it'll be very nice.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.

The report: Consider Bedden Duming Obama’s campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to New York Times, nearly half of President Barack Obama’s leading president, Hillary Clinton, considered for the 2012 ticket.
The most remarkable event in the mystery is Mark Hulparani and John Helman, who were expected by the 2012 campaign Tom, "Dable Down: Change Game: Change Game 2012."
Times received a copy of the coming book, and on Thursday evening the president’s top audiences were informed that Obama’s election could again help to determine whether the decision was held in the hope of redressing in order to know what was done by the president’s top group groups and delays in 2011.
Times National Political Director Jonathan Martin points out the whole story of the campaign and the White House for the names of the former White House staff, to learn how to change from the secretary secretaryship of the former state of the state.
The possible switch was a very safe secret within the base of the Chicago mission and within the Oval Office.
Only half of half the president’s president – including D.D., former Obama Prime Minister Jim Machina, and former White House experts were aware that David Axlerd and David Palupfi had a change of opinion.
"Dub Down" claims that the "Dub Down" attempted to change Bedin’s personal resolution, but it would not improve Obama's situation before he finally informed them of their personal decision.
In an interview with Martin, Thea has confirmed that the administration was actually thinking about the place of Clinton with the boarding.
"I looked into the whole scene," said one of them, "that's one of them." He said to the newspaper.
Do you remember that at that time the president was in danger? We were in such a manner as the Christ, and what shall we do to him?
While Theatre said as "terrorism" as "teacher," Martin told the CNN's Endance Cooper about how much of the electoral campaign would benefit from finding out how much it would cost to the police.
"Like the campaign paso and don't spend the votes and attention on the central groups until they're seriously thinking about something," Martin said on Ess360.
It's weird, Halaki, what Obama knew was looking for their team change.
Martin explained to CNN that they had asked if their boss knew about possible adjustments.
While Theat said that the president did not think he knew possible changes, former Chief of Steff admitted that it was "may be known" that Obama knew.
"Dable Down" is sure: wouldn't the political investigation of Obama's desk come up? Martin added more.
Cooper asked Martin if he had seriously thought about Obama Bidden dumping ticket research.
"Certainly," said Martin.
Do you like goo-in-Dork Ice cream?
A British scheme created the world's first-in-the-Dor ice cream - Jailfish.
Charlie Francis has benefited greatly from the sea creature to develop a great breakfast.
This idea came after reading a search letter on the jailfish and the sure scientists of China used chemical light to lighten the production of the protein.
This cream, reacting with that tongue, will increase protein level and ice cream.
Chris says that ice cream is refreshing with the heat of the mouth, that is, it will be as bright as winning.
Lik, founder of the IM Delusius ice cream company, said: "This is incredible, but the original product of early days will be found about 280 grams."
The protein that we're using in ice cream will respond to the newest PH.
As soon as the mouth warms, the protein Peach level will grow and ice cream will shine.
We've been experimenting for the past few months and it looks right to share it on Halloween because it's a wonderful flash effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream that has ever been made because jailish gold has four times more expensive than gold.
So each scooter costs me around 140 pounds [40 kg].
Although ica tastes very good.
Apne is known for the popular taste of beer, cheese, meat and gold, based in Charlie's Bristol.
But his next creation is going to be more ambitious.
He said: "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is natural impossible because of ice crystal that makes ice cream up, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
This Kremlin is used to produce a traditional quality of a jailed by Chinese scientists.

Another Day, Another Story of Fear of Freedom
This time we are warned that independent Scotland would need to be joined as a free tour area in all Europe as a condition of the EU.O.
The port control on Baraque and points out stories about the border of the Centilial Day on the walls of Hadrian.
The truth is that the Strathicoid Paper described the possible economic benefits of freedom of freedom with the rest of Europe, although it has not been described in the headlines.
No one describes the eU. members often adapt to their official rules as necessary.
Since Scotland is no longer a Shogun area, therefore Bresses will always be free to obtain whatever they really want from Scotland.
So, then, A-Khini.
And what has been so long ago has come to an end. First of all, I heard the "port control" news of the port control was about 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting point was lost in hearing this fascinating old story again.
Why should independent Scotland expect to broadcast Europe from Europe anyway?
Why is the Brussels of London to be sold, especially now?
Here is real European news: The Great, the War-East Plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With Euro crisis, the project is officially dead in Europe.
The whole EU is receiving strong forces to oppose or stop Euros as a form of anti-U.
Even in Germany, the U.S. Altiplant for Germany - who has been established this year - suddenly received about half a million votes in the General elections of September, and thus effectively released free Democrats (the sum of our libems).
The plan to build the United Europe is always against domestic violence.
However, the current financial crisis proved to be a fundamental change.
Many people have been thinking that the project has been far away from Europe, including the harsh rules imposed by Berlin and European Central Bank.
Euro's crisis was not too much to play in the major budget of national governments - it was only true in Greece.
Instead, the Euro System has established its members to establish the Exchange rate in favor of German exporters - something that German political leaders want to maintain.
Without the possibility of losing home currency, South Europe finds itself in a potentially harmful situation in comparison with Germany.
There is only one solution to reducing power and public profit - which is encouraged by Berlin.
On running budgets and currency problems have a deeper European product than those of the European producers.
As a result of the "free" power policy set by Bressels, European companies pay twice for electricity and four times for the United Nations.
It's about to be a loss that we've already seen in Grengmouth.
Even all the seats in the world can't save European Petrochemical industry from being affected by satellite U.S. shell gas.
As a result, the spirit of rebellion has stirred in people, especially in France, who was ever the main speaker of the EU.
After U.S., France's top political politicians saw the EU controlled Germany, and Paris as a way to provide bridges like property to the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as passports for political validity, and it has applied its own financial policies to Europe, causing France’s economy to collapse.
As a result, the South African politician of Marine Lee Pine, E.U.N. National Front has won over the recently installed Sosali Front to the third position.
This is currently the most popular group in France with 24 percent votes – it's time time for British lasers that they can't walk to the left that they can't go to the left to the right.
What is Lee Payne French Gorres doing with his newfound fame in the work class?
The team wants to create an anti-privileged vote for the next year's EU elections in the European Parliament.
If, as much as possible, the E.U. opposition groups do better in these elections, this kind of tattoo can affect the first time European culture.
My view is this: Soon the EU will end the anti-corruption of the anti-equator and the highest prices in Europe.
Euro will not end completely, but it will return to the nations like " Europe" in some way that will support General De Galal.
Germany and some of its subjects can keep Euro, but France and South Europe will resume their currency.
I hope the U.S. will keep the U.K. itself away from this project.
However, the growing interest of property growth in Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all?
We can choose to stay in the region of Little England.
Or we can defend our own financial interests - which includes telling Berlin and Bressels to separate themselves at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better work in the loose European system, but it seems that we keep a sign of our own.
It would be easier to work together with other similar countries in Europe.
Otherwise we should think about keeping our financial freedom on the way to Norway.
In Scotland, the S.N.P. government has been the most successful economy - the most successful political campaign in Europe, proposed by Labraser Elizabeth Darling (The Action), and then after it was won in 2011 by Tori-Liberman.
It would be a mistake to vote for freedom for Scotland, because it would have to accept the rules of cooperation made by Berlin and Brussels in that position.
Before long, though, it was time for me to grow up.
Researchers show that African-American and Spanish girls get married at a lower age than their age girls.
Physical transformation does not mean that Yavana is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals can be blamed
Experts believe that depression can be a cause of stress, low age
Young people in Taiwan are not as influential as boys before time
Former pro-n. ex-Pat Ethriez's health and family issues are news reporters on the health and family issues of children.
Should the mother be worried if her daughter begins to develop breast development and hairless at the age of 7 or 8?
This week, the U.S. Child Medical Doctor Dr. Paul Kaploviz stated that this initial physical changes are common among American American girls.
Caploitz says, "I spend a lot of time trusting allies, which usually doesn't represent the rapid progress of the whole universe."
As visible signs of development, such as the appearance of breast cancer, the hair of the ear and the hair of the hair of the ear and the flesh of the female girls.
But in the last four decades, there has been a dramatic change in the age of Rujour (first magazine) in the age of four.
In United States, average age 12.5 years old was 12.75 in 1970.
"When breast development begins to develop, the first rhyme takes at least two to three years in the film "Capult: Time-East: in the streets to deal with this problem."
The most accurate test time of Yvonne's development.
What's the start of Java, but when the brain grows up with the development of 8 years ago, it's called "B-operative."
In most cases this process will slow or stop - whose child doctors can closely monitor.
In the case of more persistent progress, the degree of advanced progress may need to be tested by the Indonesians to remove the possibility of serious problems such as the Times or the Society.
The time-old monthly and other results have been treated to delay: the time-old growth of the bones, which may lead to uninfected growth and old age.
Thanks to drugs or hormone treatment, children’s age, development rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity depend on the quality of the treatment.
Psychiatric features are also important.
The churches are concerned about caplogated drugs, but they accept, "Driving youth can increase practical points, and girls may feel different from their peers."
Another major problem can be considered: the parent does not want his younger daughter to have a journal.
He said, "They worry about the risks of the pregnancy or how they will keep themselves clean."
A woman whose daughter had started a monthly religion when she was 10 years old, recalls, "It was a shock."
Although there were signs and we also talked about medicine, but she was not emotionally prepared.
She was afraid of her school and came back to worry that she had started the first month of the year in her peers.
There are many well-known principles about the reasons for the seemingly unconstitutional Yavan.
Nevertheless, there is no constant evidence that there is no constant evidence that there could be charges against the oral messages in hormones, environments, or media in milk or other eating factors.
Boys are getting the same-time-time investment.
CaploVitz determines that its main reason is the wrath of stability.
He helped study on the girls between 6 and 9 years of age in 2001, which adds to Yavana's time.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are also many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Spanish girls have the tendency to get married before their teenage girls are born.
There's a lot of explanation.
At global level, the pattern of time-long investments, from economic conditions to weather and genes, is affected by all things.
Other puzzles: although boys are getting young at a low age of face and genetics, they are completely not as clear as their girls are.
Other doctors who attended the AAP conference supported the topic's complexities.
Even among the children, and among the children, and among the children, are the hair of the beast.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the real beginnings of Yovon," says Dr. Lawrence Silverman, at Gonzontown, New Jersey."
Members should not hesitate to seek guidance from their child doctor to assume this.
Caplovitez advised, "It means talking before the expected time."
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond properly.
A girl who has been developing from time to time needs to be assured that even though it's already existed, it is part of normal life.
The war ended at 3.1 degrees Fahrenheit [3.1 ° C].

With the debate for seat width on the larger order of jet producers.
This month's two-dimensional struggle for Asheres has become a hole in the future for long-term flights for tourists-crossers
The argument is based on the width of the Econoym class in long flights, not always given by Erlines but by its assigned position, rather than by the Latin jet Airlines, which has claimed to be key.
This week Erbys has a wide range of seats in the Economy cabin at at least 18 inches (64 cm), but it should be determined by the original standard.
The argument comes between the aircraft designers when it was sold to a long - distance operator of the Aircraft Company after the event of 17-21.
How's the last section of the plane -- especially if the seating 9 or 10 is equal to 10 is designing the design of Minni Jebo Jebo Jetss in view?
Boing says it has "777 X", which will place 406 people in 17 inches wide and 10 in a row.
The Airbes says it's going to take 350 people to a equal seat with A350.
The plane Duggs often broadcast business on technical matters through business press.
Now, Airbes 777 X has the hope of getting on more than 100 order on D.A., calling the next public.
It's recently been seen that anything started at the beginning of the Vigilion war is going to be shown to Fisero by three in a restaurant together will you accept it?
Airbes sales chief John Lehi said "The long flight from the Boeing Region Turbo" is also present in contracts."
As a change, people are getting better, but the plane doesn't change.
According to statistics from the United States Health Department, during the 1970 ’ s, Boing 747 Zebo New Kiko was defined as a modern - day trip to Kiko, and an average - 49 - year - old American male was 10 percent higher.
According to the American health statistics, the average American man in the 21st century has 39.7 inches [9.7 cm].
Airbes says that its enemies have been sticking with a seat capacity of 1950 when the name New Jet was the average member of the General Assembly, the name of the new "Jet Set".
Airbes says that they have established a research scheme that would recommend improvement in the quality of an extra 50-inch sleep quality in the width of the seat.
Boeing has argued on the scale of the air pressure, and has said that it does not depend on the decision of the manufacturers.
It also says, the research shows that over a seat's width depends on the experience of cables.
Boeing Kevin Krewer said that "it actually tells us what they really need to give the Airlines and what they want to do to succeed."
"They don't want to tell us what they're doing."
They know better than their business than anyone else.
It's about the cervirus room, but it's a quick point that it can affect Ai.
After this debate, at least 700 billion sales are estimated to be expected in the decades following this controversy, enough is available for the US and European export of the plane.
Ryter's report said the first time in July, the seat layout is actually a matter of conflict between new jet planes.
Airbes and Boeing claimed 20 percent of the seats have been committed in their new connection to the engine design, 365-Cite Boeing, compared to 777-300 Err.
The claim of Boeing depends on the comparison of 777 x minus 9 of the original 9 design.
10 is now used of comparison with benefit in unit prices.
Kevin Kenstein, head of the Airbes Transport facility in Europe, says, "It's in Boing's plane to make their products, along with more competition on seats."
On the other hand, analysts say that 10-Cit-Presidents have suggested that a number of passengers are on the side of the Danner Levels, which can go along with the rest of the purchase.
Cabein's inside expert My career, founder and editor's Russian girl network said it would be very nice for the 18th-in-century seat width passengers, but the fact is that the business point of the Airbus is handled by the threat of 77"
Airbes and Boeing seats don't communicate but provides a list of users to select from the Airlines.
The jet vendor around the world is also careful to check this layout competition.
With much rest, all buildings are also giving high density layouts for flight services and local transportation.
Giving the Airbes is a 10 is equal to A350 but says it's not yet sold.
But recently, Airbes emphasized some of its jet planes to the largest cable seats in order to need more cable facilities.
Without support of modern jet planes, a new project would not be possible to fly on standard, but it could be dislodged from the wave of 77 X sales.
New Anti-Nineine Victims can end the joy of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-Ninten vaccine that can end the fun that comes from smoking.
One of the secrets of the vaccines was able to protect the mice from niotin's neck for all their lives.
Another test needs to be further before the experiment starts, which may take several years, but Dr. Ronal Crystal, professor of Royal Cornell Medical College in New York, said that there are positive points.
Professor Cornell said: "We hope that this kind of vaccine can finally help millions of people who have tried to quit smoking, using all the methods in the market today, but they found that Nikontin's blood is stronger than these."
The new vaccine has a harmful virus that has been prepared to bring genetic information from the intent of creating anti-Nine anti-tribbezes.
The virus, which then transfusing the electromagnetic cell, begins to form a permanent stream of antibidz.
Antibidz finds any Nicotine detects in blood, and prevents smoking from rising inside the brain before they reach the brain before they reach the brain.
In the test, the vaccines that were later given Nikotin were acting their normal activity.
Researchers say, but the rat that was not treated was "good," it was a sign that Nicotine had reached his brain.
The use was described in a magazine called Science Trans Trans Trans Trans Transalsin.
The previous tobacco vaccine has failed because they were antibidz.
There was to be a trial on regular intervals so that the antibidz level of antibidz was established, but it proved to be expensive and exploitable.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be too much, because the cell will make the body the factory of antibody.
Professor Crystal said that if future human vaccines are safe, it could be given to children before smoking, which can be saved from nicotine.
But it may be used to quit smoking by people who smoke.
He said: "They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not find happiness because of Nikottin's vaccine, which can help save their addiction.
British scientists critical the result, but there was a need for more research.

A study has been announced by the British government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project in Scotland.
By HS2, work requires high speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will soon begin with the first step in 2026.
Transport minister Barons Kramer told that this project would be "Brits."
Scotland's Transport Minister, Keith Brown, said that working with the British government on this project they are very "explained".
First step includes the new high speed line between London and West Midlands.
When the second step is complete, lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government measured the cost of high speed linking between London and North England by adjusting the cost of high link between the country and North England by comparing £32.7 Bian.6 billion.6 billion.
The British government, who was talking to Scotland Transport, directed the HS2 Limettad to consider the possibility of training train skills and travel time for North England and Scotland.
It includes the possibility of traveling three hours or less possible from Glasgo and Edinberg to London.
According to Baronse Kramer: "Our goal is to bring the real national network closer to US and its cities."
We're going ahead with HS2, because its benefits will be too much.
Without it we will face problems related to the capacity of our train network.
But it's also about the connectability of 18 British cities with Glasgo and Edinberg, which will be better connected because of HS2.
According to Scottyer Carmic: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scott Brown, Mr. Carmike called back from the HS2 network of Scotland.
Mr. Brown said: "The high speed is possible for Scotland to have a lot of financial benefits from the railway, but it will also increase the financial burden on the high speed in Britain throughout Britain.
So we are eager to work in the British government's partnership, so we can test the options for bringing up high speed train in Scotland, creating benefits for all and producing Glasgo-Ednberg line, which is already designed by the British government.
The next year, I am ready to review the check report with the British government's ministers and make decisions together on the next action.
The air power device rules are now being affected in Australia
We must continue closing our telelets and smart phones while flying on the plane and landing the device.
US Union Airlines have opened options to allow US Airlines to change their processes so that traveling E-book will be able to read, watch, watch, play on their device, play in "Uyun" mode.
Travelers can still do this through a lot of flights, but many people don't seem to be able to reach their e-book as they fly and fly.
Australian Airlines are considering this decision, which allows US Air Service companies to do much more work to meet this need, but they indicate that they have no immediate plan to change their processes.
The citizen plane security official also said that he was also thinking about the announcement, but emphasized that the use of electronic devices in major flight movements in Australia is still under threat.
"In the present case, there is no special policy controlling the power of power devices in the airspace," the official said, "it comes to the conclusion of the aircraft service systems that ensures that the security system has always been completely established, and that the security system is always followed by members of the crew."
Virginia, who is already talking with CASA about expanding the use of her internal y-Fi entertainment system, is already ready to follow this change, but she asked for a further action on the policy of Winton.
"We'll welcome review by CASA on the use of electricity devices, because we really think it will provide better experiences to customers, because we now have (Wireless In-Floit Entertainment) in our airports.
Quantas said it would now follow the current rules.
He said, "We can't use electricity tools during flight and landing our current policy, and we don't have a quick plan to change it."
The AA decision applies to American Elrelines.
Well, we're always interested in entertainment development that can benefit visitors, and we'll certainly consider the decision of FA and the reasons behind it.
The effect of the decision will be different on every US Air Service Company and will depend on their planes.
Air service companies will need to prove that they can endure radio addiction with their airport mobile devices, as well as their rules, training material, caron-on-Beagge programs and visitors to study with them for short description details.
FA said, "After the authorisation of their planes, he is allowed to use the lightweight power tools, such as the electric power tools, the tebllets and smartphones."
In less visible matters, the driver will guide passengers to close their equipment while running off the plane.
The group has also suggested to keep heavy equipment at the bottom of the seat or in the upper room during flight and landing.

325 million US saving package for Tuzi’s health
The organization has emphasized that there are strict conditions associated with the safety of 325 million dollars for the health system that will ensure that the government cannot ruin the government's rule.
The United Health Minister of Health has announced that the United Nations, the elderly population of the island, the highest rate of disease, and the system’s limits are being “surpassed” to solve the present crisis.
During four years, the decision of the Vithage-Punjay was followed by the government's advice with the independent Sansad Andrew Wilki of Stamania.
Mr. Pleissak said today, "Circuous rescue package has brought to our faith that this will solve the special challenges faced by the Kingdom."
The 325 million dollars package also includes an alternative supply plan of $3 million.
The OrthPadic and Mothandand Seri, along with 2600 additional operations, will help solve the last united issues.
It also includes wealth to start personal electronic health care after a walk-in clinic, hospital training for medical experts, mental health services, and local hospitals.
Ms. Pleissak said, "This is the investment, by the front doctors, is the best way I've been told to improve the health system of Tasmania."
The minister emphasized that the government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability.
The State has to maintain the current estate level to achieve democracy wealth, and every month it has to report where additional authorities are being sold.
The project of three members will be tied to the action of the three members to ensure that the Kingdom will provide effective and efficient services.
Mr. Wilki said that 325 million dollars would not have meant much longer, until "As far as the public health system of Tasmania is better improved to lead more environmental levels."
They immediately praised the government for their immediate response to the request for help, which they were present at the beginning of May.
Mr. Wilki said, "I hope the united aid package will be very helpful to separate the state's public health system from the trouble list."
According to the State Government, these additional alternate processes will be brought back mainly to recent harvests.
But organized environmental health expert Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is "band-Aid solution."
He said to the U.B. TV, "We're here because the Laber State government takes $430 million in his health system.
You can't believe the good news day of the good news being taken by the State government about half an billion dollars and given by the National Union for $300 million.

A statement by the OPC.D.B. to the United Nations to work together with the United Nations says that its team has been "so happy and confirmed, and that all of Syria's most important product and mixed tools have seen being destroyed."
He also said, "No further investigation plans are being made."
At the beginning of this week, observers said that they have completed the first step of the work by Dammsky at 21 cents of the 23nd centre.
The observers said they were not able to go to two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, O.P.C.B.bu said that these two centers were given to Syria and that the chemical weapons that were placed there were brought to other corners of the declarations that were being observed."
It didn't immediately appear that units in Sierra were one of the two centers where the OPC.D. was not able to monitor the surveillance.
Syria has presented plans for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which will be approved by the work committee next month.
"I welcome the determination and excitement shown by people to the most challenging mission you have ever been made by the OPCDBO."
For three years this home battle has been the main focus of the civil war of Asad's government and its security forces, which include members of the Yeit Party, and the conflict between rebel Sunnii Muslim Muslims.

The strength of the register office (before).
According to the police, the prosecutor’s lawyer Clark and recorder Balbir took out of the book of the Old Land and then bought the new stup paper and prepared them for the register register.
And after that, the real register was sold to Jalyi Registri records.
Then the accused sold the land into millions of dollars.
There, they took weight on the paper.
Then the real owner of the land would remain in custody of police and administration.
Jail Registri had special attention on the land of the NRIG ground.
Because there's no one who's caring for the NRIG land.
So it's easy to sell the land's forest recipes.
The police commissioner Gill told the charges that they had already prepared about 150 jurists.
According to the police, there are also cases of fraud and stealing cases against Rasha.
Shocked by the bomb blasts in Bali
At 202 people who were killed in bomb blast in 2002, the authorities and relatives of 202 people who were killed in 2002 screamed at the bomb blaster who shouted that the U.S. Tikk should face the firing team.
Tukk, who spent nearly 10 years running one of the most wanted people in South-east Asia, was told yesterday to play his role in building a explosive device used in the bomb blast.
He could be released in 15 years when he was given parole.
45-year-old Umar, the popular tourist region of Kuta, was found guilty of two armed murders, including 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many people were injured.
He was also found guilty of several other charges related to terrorism, including the extended bomb blasts held in Indonesia’s former funeral of Christmas in 2000 at the Church of Indonesia.
The organizers asked for life's funeral, even though they could ask for a bomb that was known as the master of the bomb, the person who was called "the rascal man".
The decision renewed the painful memories of June Cortin, a woman living in Perth, who lost 39-year-old daughters in a destructive attack by her partners.
He stopped his neighbors and said that the tick should have been put to death.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other terrorists.
Mr. Courtney said to the AAP, "He should be standing before the firing team."
Every day I have to live without my cousin, and without my daughters.
On October 12, 2002, after the explosion of the bomb that was loaded outside the camp outside the camp on October 11, 2002, the name of this club was lost.
Peter Hughes, a suicide bomb filled with explosives, was in the paddle bar at the time of the explosion 20 seconds before the blast was blown.
They moved into a month-long coma and three times their deaths during living-sharing devices.
Mr. Hagues says that Thakk should have found the same answer to this date, which was found within three other members of the group of Jamma Islamia - the Amarillos, Chiefs, and the Ima Sea - who were sentenced four years ago.
Actually, this person should be put to death before anyone else.
And ye shall see no man putting it upon his shoulders, that he may lay it upon his shoulders.
After killing 202 people and killing billions of people, 20 years of age is not enough.
Ticket, the last person to get out of the bomb blasts.
He survived for nearly a decade, but finally, in January 2011, the U.S. Army was arrested in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the former U.S. Army killed former chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, F.B.I. agent reported that the report revealed that Bill Laden was in Pakistan to try to restore contact between South-east Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't surrender."
Even even now, so many people don't really have to suffer mental pain.
The decision came before the 10th year of attack this year, which will be marked by parties in Bali and Australia.
Mrs. Courtney said, "This year there will be tears."
Still can be called against his sentence.
FAA: Airlines can now use gas gas in air (can't call via cell phone)
The Air Traveler Gate will be able to read from the gate, read from the gate, play, play, watch, watch, music, but don't speak with your cellphone - this is the most-relative approach to the Master - the most-relative approach to new directions.
But friends should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference in FAA, Michael Huttar said how fast these changes are being processed, it would be different in every airport.
Airlines must point out how their plane, the new direction-directors, and the training manuals of the crew members of their pilot team to show direction and storage rules.
F.A. said it's already acquired plans to expand the use of the portable electronic device on the plane.
Delta and Zetbu are from the Airlines that have already presented.
F.A. said in an explanation, " Based on design status, we can accept the extended use of electronic devices very quickly."
Meanwhile, friends need to close their smartphones, telelets, and other devices when the airport is closed.
They are expected to reach 10,000 feet of plane heights and not start until the captain is granted permission by the captain.
The passengers are expected to turn off their device while the plane is down, and don't turn it off until the plane's gone down.
F.A. said, within the end of new directions, airlines that are full of air pollution are safe from air pollution, they can allow their clients to use the plane, flight time and time time for technology.
Most new Airline companies and other planes that have been adjusted to use a high altitude are expected to meet these values.
Laura Gladys, president of the Association of Environmental Environment, has welcomed these changes.
"When the law is secure, we're going to work together with the Airlines companies.
When this point comes to the point, we're like "Hul Monsters" as well.
The agency said it would still be forbidden to connect the Internet to less than 10,000 feet high, to save, to send or receive messages, or to download data.
Friends will be asked to keep their smartphones, tebalts and other devices in the application mode.
So there will still be no discussion with friends, online square-like events, such as the game, when Eric Baldwin, was playing on his smartphone during the year 2011, while the U.S. Airlines were forbidden to block the device from the U.S. Airlines.
And there is still to be collecting laptops such as a heavy device because they are concerned about hurting other people in the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be blocked during the flight.
In connection with the phone call, the United States has no F.A.A.
During flights and landings, the FA can block restrictions on some electronic devices.
Last month, Mark Rosenson of National Transport Security Center, CBS News Specialists, said that cell phone is still considered a threat.
“Sel phones are really serious issues, not just because they can create depression in the navigation-related device, but because they can also create stress in cell phones when they're in air.
In order to test this point, the management of the world's projects by F.A. Committee of F.A. stated that the government should allow more of the personal electronic devices to be used by the government last month.
In recent years the pressure in the FBI has increased to decrease the use of them.
San. Claire McCkeske, such as D-M, has said there is no valid security reason for dismissing.
Getting under these restrictions is still more difficult because the device's use is universal.
Some studies also indicate that about three thirds of passengers forget or ignore the instructions to close their device.
F.A. began to ban using electronic devices via friends in 1996 when the F.M. radio and the high-quality gajit was received due to the use of F.M. radio and communication devices.
New Airlines companies have more depend on the electronic system than the previous generation of planes, but they too have been designed and approved to resist electronic intervention by F.A.
Airlines have been proposed using y-Fi at the crossing height for years.
The plane modified for the y-Fi system is also more prone to depression.
Horta said that most Airlines companies should meet the qualifications for better use of electronic devices at the end of the new direction-direction device.
Today's electronic device is the world's modern-day electronic device, much more than the previous generation's electronic device releases radio transmissions.
For example, E-Readers, the most anonymous transmission of the page is when it rotates pages.
but the transactions are available when downloading or sending data from the device.
Amazon.com is also among those who take part in reducing the use of the device by friends.
In 2011, the company's authorities loaded his entire Grand E-Riders in Airlines and flew him to test problems but no problem was found.
F.A. advisory committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using the device.
Douglas Ked of the National Air Force, said that they believe that the device is real, whether it's a threat name.
Other members of the committee said that only pilot reports are described by pilots described in support of the device in the airport system, most of them are older.
However, members of the committee have requested that the F.A. pilot permit them to stop the device while the plane was being dropped in less visible vision.
Traveling companies have welcomed changes and have given them a general knowledge of people traveling to the latest era of technology.
The C.S.T.O.R. Dary said that we are happy that F.A.A. has recognized that traveling with pleasure is not impossible with tourists, safety and security.

Birds were released back to the forest by air transport for protection from North Sea Rig
The North Sea is left behind by air travel to the forest by the airport.
It was sent back to Eberdin before the bird was restored back to its elastic rescue centre by the SPCA.

Before leaving, the street railway was healthy and healthy.
Is Europe’s high class ready for business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April and promised to bring the business together and determine what changes to our relationship with the U.K. worker and rich producer E.U.
We asked them what they think about Britain's business with Britain’s commercial leaders.
U-gave has been considering 1,000 business leaders, representing Britain's business shape, areas and places.
The conclusion of this survey might be surprising to many.
We found that a large part of business wants to export out of Europe now, and to focus on countries that are becoming modern and increasing, while E.U.S. members are getting aggressive.
They want the government to focus on new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, not on the long-term and ill effects of the development of the GU's mysterious institutions.
When asked about specific policy fields such as production from a copyright mirror from the law, most business leaders believed that they should come back to Westminster.
The common market could be easily seen by the average market, businesses say that the price of Brices's winment is far greater than the benefits of becoming part of Europe’s commercial territory - even the vast businesses that were directly responsible for European companies, 40 percent agreed.
Finally and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that a large part of it obviously wants to go ahead of business relationships and relationships rather than political change.
The conclusion, which was seen in the levels of major business groups, suggests that businesses are moving to a "constitutive change" that would restore the U.K. that has been lost.
It's worth a high price - the point for Britain and for a better deal has changed 16 percent in favor of continuing in the EU.
The prime minister should not be in doubt: This survey shows that Britain’s business, e.w, supports their plans to communicate on the terms of the membership of Britain’s membership in Britain.
It also pointed out that businesses expect to change the current power balance and return a positive change to the U.K.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is very urgent because it is moving forward in the direction of Eurojan, relevant economic and political organization.
The priority must be to have jobs and increase in Britain, such as our surveying points out that it means a new Canadian focus on business and a new trade operation in Brazil.

In 2011, two employees were convicted of child yon crimes against the carring child charge worker Jonathan Lord, who was accused of charges against the W.M.C.C.R.R.B.B.R.B.B.u... in 2011.
But in his own statement, Ayog said, "It didn't come in the case of the child union within his organization," it was told to Ayog.
The chief officer Philip Green was asked about the case that was charged with child pornography crimes on an N.M.C.A.C., and another case was charged against his children who were taking care of the children in the United States in 1991.

The company's total evidence is that the YM.C.A.A.A. was denied, and this year this year the second highest rating received in four possible ratings.
Mr. Green that connects with the 21-year-old age of Y.M.C.A., admitted that the "control with me" arrangement failed because of setting up the Lord, and failed to make sure that employees were fully informed of their rights regarding child security violations.
At the beginning of this year, Lorde was accused of crimes with 12 children during the two-year-old operation.
He was sentenced to a black hole for at least six years.
But Mr. Green refused the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in the W.M.C., which caused workers to ignore Baal security violations by the Lord.
The workers who saw the violation gave the Witnesses to spend time alone with the children by the Lord, taking them personally, sit them in bed, tell them that he loves them and that he loves them and wants them to play on their mobile phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was in the service of the Lord, and he said for Baal Security training, because he was concerned about his behavior, testified that the W.M.C.C.C. security director Jackie Bart, who had been observing the Lord's command to watch the Lord's Child Service for most of his time.

He said, "No, his friend with Lord led them astray their decision to inform him of it."
Mr. Green said that he had given the W.M.C.D. Mandal his view of the "noting information" to the organization for the organization.
Mr. Green said that soon after the trial, workers were decided to sign on confidential agreements by the employees, R.M.C.C.'s school administrator Lime White.

Scientists have also revealed on the subject how a dog's actions and his forehead are involved.
The past researchers have found that happy dogs move on their knees to the right (the dog's eye) while the poor dogs move to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can recognize this delicate mystery and respond to it.
This study is published in Journal Kent Bilji.
The neurological professor George Valeritaira from University of Transto stated: “All humans know that the left and right part of the brain’s left and right parts are involved in a variety of forms of encouragement that contributes to positive or negative feelings."
Here we have tried to see it among the nations.
He explained that dogs had the right part of the brain right to the left of the brain, and the two shots played different roles in emotions like humans.
To learn more about how dogs react to the single wave of snow by other dogs, researchers have watched animals watching other dogs.
They measured the hearts of petal dogs and understood their behavior.
We probably don't have much time to understand why their doubles sometimes move on the other side.
P. Valeritagra said: "We presented dogs with dogs in the actual version of dogs, to deal with other issues, and we could see the past on the left or on the left."
And when the beasts saw a young dog moving toward his left side, they were very content.
But when they turned their tail toward the left side, their heart grew ever deeper and they saw selling.
According to Dr. Valeritagra, they don't think dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these practices.
Rather, they feel that dogs have learned from their own experience about what they should be concerned about and not on whom.
He said: "If you've met other dogs many times, and if they move their backs together, it's related to more friendly behavior and the right part treat you less friendly."
Researchers say that these conclusions can provide better information about the feelings of owners, animals, and teachers of animals.
John Bradshaw, head of the University of British University of Virginia, explained that it is not the first study for dogs that is important for dogs.
Last year, a team of university of Lincoln found that when dogs look at a dog, they turn their heads toward the left and turn their heads toward the happy dogs.
In other research at University of Victoria, Canada, he said: "In contrast with other studies, when the robots were moved to the left side of the dog's face, he was more likely to reach the queen than the dogs were to be selling."
He said the difference was because in various studies dogs were not fully considered animals or robots in movies.
He explained that it can help study how to react to real dogs by dogs.
"Since different hospitals have found enough evidence that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more information is still available - and there are no dogs in this case," he said.
However, the easy way their behavior can be recorded, it seems that we probably don't seem to have much time to understand why their doubles sometimes move on the other side.

Pope Francis will declare the name of the first cardinal in February
Vatican has announced that Pope Francis will first become a new cardinal of the Catholic Church on February 22 in their work.
The cardinals are the high ranks of the Catholic Church, their position only below the pope, and these people choose the pope, so France will eventually appoint the first group of people who will eventually help select their successor.
Now there's the total of 201 Cardines.
Well, after he reached 80 years of age, he would not be allowed to participate in the pope's election - it comes into the group of 120 "Cordinal electoral".
In an announcement by Vatican Prime Minister Federico Lombardy, president of the Vatican at a time, said that before the New Cardinances will be organized, all existing cards will be held, called Pope-Services.
Lombardi said, "Pap Frances decided to make his decision to organize the Pope-Pap France's pope's decision so that it would be easier to make plans for other parts of the world to participate in.."
Jack Valerro of the Catholic Wise said that by February, the number of cardinal electoral electorals was expected to decrease.
He generally announced the name of the Pope, the number of cardinals, as less than 120, and the age-year-old cardinals, who are more than 80 years old.
Valerro said that the next year's popes would be important because this year's election of France will be the first Pope to meet in March.
Currently there is a kind of reference to Europe and especially to Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope, even from the rest of the world, is interested in the balance of balance.
In South America, 40 percent of Roman Catholics are Roman Catholics, but their number is very small.
The cardinals Association by Francis, which is a group of eight cardinals around the world, who have been searching for the way to reform the church, will also be the first to be selected after they have been selected.
Before it was the pope's decision to all things.
Valerio said, "Now Frances has chosen these eight cardinals to help her."
He's asking for advice from French cardinals.
But we're not already in this situation - it's totally new.
Valerro said that the pope usually ranked the bishop of large places, but French was "the full-scale surpriser" so we don't know who they're talking about."
Failed to return the pintback to the GM.Pup truck to correct the site box
According to a report by U.S. Auto security companies on Friday, General Motors Company, its latest new Shelterdo and G.M.C.R.R.R.K.R.P.P.A. is calling back some 11,000 trucks back to correct a lack of power in the safe truck.
In some trucks, there may be a lack in the free seating system.
As a result, the organization failed to follow the auto security standards of the seatback.
According to a report on the National Road Traffic Safety System website, "if traffic is caught from behind the vehicle, it is possible to protect the driver's driver properly, which will lead to damage."
Back called the models were created between August 1 and September 10th.

The Joys of Obama’s Adolescence
Omaha twice voted in hope of change
They say Obama's great effort has been interrupted by the policy of the GOP.P.
The policy of restricting the use of OBMAKI website can’t resurface drone attacks
The 2008 Japan Memorial reminder reminds us of what could happen
Nethanel P. Morris Hard Medical School is the second year's student in the second year.
I'm reading very painful books today.
It is a book about which I think it will motivate me during the second year of medical school and hope for me.
His name is "the courage to speak", and it is the 2008 presidential election campaign of Barack Obama.
When I get angry with my patients in the night and go to bed, this book will lead me into a period where politics inspired millions and could hold your breath.
The elections proved to be a demonstration, and news speakers had retired to show the historical significance of that time.
My friends had tears of joy, and my parents saved every news of the news.
A group of young telescopes was going to White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
In 2008, they had 82 percent approval ratings during Obama's President.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a grievous truth, as from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days - they look like a distant memory, a painful memory of lost opportunities.
It really changed after I first voted for the first time.
Simply stated, none of it could have been imagined.
I give Obama a credit for many achievements, from the Aphobeé Keere to our army back from Iraq, "Don't tell me not until Osama bin Laden was killed."
In addition, I believe that the policy of opposing prejudice has prevented many attempts to proceed to our country: the public option for foreign reform, health service, and other restrictions on Guangzhou Bay.
But many times in which I took the support of my colleagues and fellow colleagues - I have the answer to the answer that I can give them.
I've reached the point of political despair.
The policy against Republican is not the answer to foreign leaders, neither is the answer to drone attacks on children in foreign lands.
It cannot answer data about the personal life of ordinary American citizens by National Security Agency, nor can it answer the reactions of those who are exposed to government corruption.
It does not reveal the reason for the murder of American citizens without a trailer, nor is it less than public rights and insurance limits during the Presidentate camp.
It can't answer the conclusions of the report, which says that by the White House, the effort to silence Madio has been "the most dramatic ever since."
And most recently, it cannot allow a simple website to be designed after three years signed in the order of the Aphodbe Cir Act.
I don't know what I expected.
If, in 18 years of age, I had to assume that the regime system, could disrupt the political campaign leading to it.
Clearly, the unpredictable office is not an anti-continuous way, since opposition political parties and or visible events such as the nuclear murders will provide the size of our public discussion.
Nevertheless, the examples I set up seem most likely to be chosen by the administration.
It's bothering you the most.
I gave back a vote for Obama in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with her expectations.
The real Roman presented a confusing and unexplained option, which seemed to be not to determine their values or their position.
I thought there was another work for Obama that would be free from the pressures of the choice of the future, to fulfill the hopes that we have heard long ago.
However, while Obama's measuring rate is less than 45 percent less than this week, it has become increasingly difficult to return to 2008 through that book.
When I see him, I remember their vows.
This week, he was reading a part of the book, described as the way in which Obama was affected by Obama's loss in Pennsylvania Prime Minister.
In a post-martum camping, he told his servants that they need to return to the trailer, and be true to their purposes.
He said, "I want to get my count back."
We should remember who we are.'
I can't agree with you any more than five years later, Mr. President.
The comments expressed in this comment are from Natheil Morsi.
Cleive Palmer claimed that PM. Tony Abbott has a good fight about the past vacation plan.
The Arabist M.P. Cliv Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a good fight about the traditional holiday plan because their daughters may be pregnant, and they can benefit from it.
The Maharaja, who is in debate with Bill’s pay for 6 million dollars in China, claims that he has tried to answer questions about the struggle.
The Palmer United Party can control four votes in the Internet, which may be important to determine how to reduce carbon and investors.
But Mr. Palmer claims that only the best efforts of the journalists can be meaningful, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters can personally benefit from the policy.
He said, “A good wife is one of them, so let her bring her back to you, and do not insult her husband.”
Two months after the election, the election is officially announced by Mr. Palmer's President of Fairifix has declared the victory of 53 votes of the state.
Mr. Palmer asked for the election price to proceed faster than fast.
Tony Aot's daughters are Franzes and Britt.
Should the selection result in our receiving two months of vote?
He said, "We should have a better system."
Why don't we have a system that we can enter our computer, immediately vote, and we have the result at 6:30 a.m.
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencil to mark the content.
So, what if someone does not like him and delete him?
I think using pencils in today's time seems to be too difficult.
The elections are studying options for electronic elections, and recently an online interview with New Zealand has issued.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said his policy includes building an international airport for Sansan Costa, and they are "very serious" to their new job.
Public status is for service.
He said, "We can't serve the community at this important time."
The critics had to worry.
Referring to the assembly on this occasion, the president of the Association, Ramesh Nigi, president of the Assassination, declared a loud cry over the corrupt law system in the country.
He proves that criminals are being disappointed by the rapidly growing attacks on politicians and their seats.
They have no fear of police and administrative system.
He recently mentioned such events on different locations as saying that when the administrative community is not safe, the safety of the common man can be easily calculated.
RBS towards two Forks traceers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has blocked two trackers from two people in their foreign exchange exchange exchanges, the case has been received by two experts, the other indication is that the global global-technology of the market's economy is moving forward through traffic in Herifer.
Some of the largest bankers in the world, including UBS Barclay, Dish Banks, and RBS, have confirmed that the largest financial market in the world has ever been received with the release of $5.3 troll every day, in testing-time.
These two trackers are the first members of the RBS, who have been charged with investigations of the anti-reconcilation of the Libor Space Bank debt debt debt hacker scandal.
Banks have confirmed that the bank has received a request for information from the investors this month.
Two weeks ago the bank said, "We continue our investigation on this matter, and we are fully supporting the FCA and other investors."
Last month, experts said that RBS was sent to the previous tracker and sent e-mails and instant messages to the archives of the UK, financial authorities.
This tracker, Richard Yus, left the RBS in 2010, is believed to have been released from its current position of the European head of European heads in J.P.M.

None of these have been charged with any of the wrong actions on the tracker.
In the case, experts said that the quick message group of Mr. Yuser includes Barclays and Siegro banks.

At least six official authorities on global level are examining the charges against the government of the European Aug, Winama, Switzerland's anti-social government, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the United States, and the Hong Kong Congress - to re-tributate their legal retributions on the market.
From the case, people who knew the HSBC, Siegro, J.M.M.M.M.M., and credit Sussi have also found an internal test, or request for information from the vendors.
Banks are carefully examining the messages and emails of the wrong action for many years in search of an incorrect operation.
News about the test-translation has been placed in tracks of a region, which has been among the most successful investors in investment banking units for years, but they have had to face this challenge because of short-teen-teen-transactions.
Some bankers tried to press the case to say that it was impossible to steal a large and too largely foreign exchange exchange exchange exchange market, but the official records say that it is not necessary to be true.
The director said that despite the vast majority of foreign currency-Virtual ratings, Liquidity is using the growth of your own platforms and banking platforms in spite of the greater magnitude of the privatization of the privatization of the privatization of foreign currency, "You can begin to affect the market by using your own platforms."
The news came the same day, on the day that credited the tracker from his xenchad Lands desk in London this week, which killed nearly $6 million people last year.
The bank immediately declined the following authorisations and is cooperating with its vendors.
Credit Susi said, "We believe that the tracker had worked alone, and he was controlled."

True, our work can't go without money.
Money is one of the biggest needs for life, but it's not in our best interests.
We treasure Karik Mass's bitter Teriodshi.
The god of wealth is a god of great riches, and the god of destruction, and the god of death, even the god of kings.
Our religion and our life are important places of wealth.
No wealth is good or bad.
Good-bye our feelings toward wealth.
There is nothing more valuable than the welfare of humanity, but the wealth that has become a cause of pride has nothing to do with it.
Give us money for a holy purpose, and for a holy purpose.
Everyone has the responsibility to earn money for the family's income.
Some part should have the feeling of abuse on society, but the motivation for borrowing large collections or Yan-Ken-In-Cane-- is to destroy our conscience, personality.
The spirit of charity should always be in the mind.
A portion of the wealth that you have given me may be the foundation of life.
For many people living in society, we all should think.
In fact, in the men of life, religion, work, and moksha are given equal honor.
Every man hath his wealth and success, and every man hath his wealth, and every man according to his ability.
It's the only thing that's always lasting with respect.
No man is rich in riches, neither is he able to rejoice in it, neither is he able to do any work.
If anyone has money, don't envy him.
The true riches are the ways of a rich man, and the ways of a rich man are many.
There is no one who can afford more than a worker's creation.
Another thing, money isn't just like currency.
It would also be your health, character, love for others.
Try to be the owner of this treasure.

Khan accused the Kingdom government for this, saying that their security has been removed from political reasons.
In 2002, they were among the minister of the Ministry of Justice, who won the PDP ticket for a year.
Slave Hasan Khan said that I've been in security since 1996.
I dwell in the booths of the terrors. I dwell in the booths of the rocks.
There was a security system at my home at the CRPF security station in the head of all inspectors.
I'm also with the guards, but the warrior took all my security back suddenly.
While the security system was going out of my house, I spoke to live solutions and live SP.
But instead of restoring security, they just said he would examine the case.
In this context, however, when the IGP Abdul Geni Mirr of Kashmir was contacted, he refused information about the case and said that it is sensitive.
I'll personally examine how a former minister and a former secretary has been removed from the security of the leader.
The country's main center of Congress said that there's nothing in my information.
If Hasan Khan's safety has been compromised, it's very serious.
I am now in Jammu, the next two days.
I'll discuss this point with the administration.

Pressing forward from clay, rivers, and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. Georges Well, serving free health services in rural areas of Cameroon
Wells and their crew watch hundreds of diseases every week
Western African countries don't have much doctors; there is only one doctor for 5,000 people
Give your vote here or through your mobile.
Dr. Georges Vale is one of the top 10 politicians in 2013.
You can vote for someone else for them or for someone else in 10 to make CNN. Year's leader.
The winner will get $20,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Wells came to his sick father in Hoshh and saw his father going to the hospital, who had not been properly able to help them.
Jammel Vale died in 1981 at the nearest car accident in Yonde, the capital of Cameroon.
They had only broken their hands at first, but an infection spread to their brains, and he created blood transfusions that affected the rest of their lives.
Georges Well says, "There was no neroses in Cameroon."
If we had the money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Val took his father, and a great multitude of people gathered around the clinics and hospitals and obtained any treatment he could find.
He said: "This is indeed easy.
You leave home at 5:00 p.m. you'll be the first person to arrive at the hospital, but not so.
There are many who suffer many diseases.
Some may wait and die in the face of death.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Well's father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
If you compare, there's a doctor for every 413 people in the United States.
And if there be physicians there, surely many of the inhabitants of Cameroon can't afford it.
Two of the five live below the poverty line, and about two thirds of the income of health services in the country are private areas.
Well says, "Their only problem is poverty."
And because they are poor, they can't enjoy their life.
And when he saw the affliction of his father, and the pain of his kindred, he determined to make an end of it.
Dr. Georges and volunteer teams have been treated free medical treatment last year.
They also became medical doctors, and they began working as a witness at the Central Hospital in Uganda.
And they started the non-lascovaim, which goes to rural areas to provide free medical services for weeks.
Since 2008, they and their volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, they sit in the van and almost 30 people, bind doctors from the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical attention.
Never even luck with them.
They have to pass through the rivers and the dust more than one time.
But when they arrive, they really receive the honor that politicians are supposed to have: the best seat that can be presented by guests, singing and dancing, and the community.
The free medical service in these villages is actually a cause for rejoicing, and Well - with his big smiles and non-uniformity.
The next morning, their team starts meeting with hundreds of diseases.
He said, "We're meeting 500 people every trip."
They come from the village about 60 miles [60 km]; and they come to Paddal.
They provide various medical services for all weeks.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and Yaon - speaking diseases.
Others may receive a tax, a donation, or free birth certificate -- this document needs to be needed in school but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening the team performs simple surgery with local terms.
Operation is usually done at school, Town Hall, or home; after the process, patients walk and make room for the next person.
The group's generator publishs in the operating room and publishs satellites, and Vel and their volunteers get up early on Sunday morning-sumbub.
It's very fast, but village musicians usually help the team to keep the team in force.
He said, "They play all night to keep us alive and continue their work."
On Sunday their team returns to the city, they get tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group - including Camran's medical and foreign doctors - has been treated free treatment last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those whom they help.
One man said that he would be able to go back to work because of the free heart surgery.
He said: "I will certainly punish him and my family forasmuch as I live."
In addition to running clinics and working as surgeons at the hospital for weeks, personal medical clinics are also working at near Yonda at night.
He explained that it is their second job that causes 60% of their non-smoker work; the rest of the rest is fulfilled with personal contributions.
A second-year-old medical student at Dryxel University in Philadelphia and volunteer at Vale's team, Katy O'Malley said, "I don't know when they sleep."
They are always in the hospital, or are trying to earn money for their organization so that they run these campaigns.
This is a useful opportunity for those who come from the United States and Europe to join the campaign of O'Malley, who can never be found in their country.
O'Malley said, "In genetic medicine we help Dr. Wells to get the tools for the blood pressure, we're capable of experience."
As a second-year-old medical student in the United States, you will never have an opportunity to do this.
Volunteer students usually use their own business to reach Cameroon, and they often come with the aid of the Danish medical personnel.
But after the arrival of Yenda, they're living for Anna-jana, and for instructions.
O'Malley says, "There's no doubt they're serious."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help Cameroon's people will never end.
For Well, almost the load of work, not hard.
Help others to live a happy life, to fulfill the promise made to their father, these are things that give them great pleasure.
Well says, "I'm very happy to do this."
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to ease their pain.
